AB  - Carotenoids are routinely used as biogenic markers for plant debris in the marine environment. But, like the chlorophylls, carotenoids suffer chemical alteration and even hydrolysation to colourless endproducts when detritus is metabolized by animals and bacteria in the water column. This study investigates the stability of pigments after deposition in surface sediments. In a laboratory experiment using oxic sediment, the carotenoid lutein exhibited greater stability against chemical and microbial breakdown than chlorophyll a, which has a half-life of only 3 wk under oxic conditions. In situ investigations in anoxic mud sediments in Kiel Bight, Germany, showed rapid disintegration of polar xanthophylls and chloropigments. beta-Carotene and lutein were relatively stable in anoxic sediment. Data from a 1 yr field study at 2 stations in Kiel Bight are reported as an example of the applicability of carotenoid pigments as biogenic markers in sediments. Advective transport of macrophyte debris was investigated by measuring the concentration of lutein in different sediments on a down-slope transect. Lutein exhibited a pattern of slowly increasing red macrophyte input to the muddy sediments, starting in autumn and continuing through winter; but it was not detected in shallow sand sediments near the growth sites of the algae. Fucoxanthin and peridinin were found in both muddy and sandy sediment, reflecting sedimentation events resulting from transport of phytoplankton from the water column.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to assess malathion-induced hematological responses of Barbonymus gonionotus (silver barb) and its recovery patterns in malathion-free water. Fish (45 days old) were exposed to two sublethal concentrations, namely, 25% and 50% (i.e., 3.78 and 7.56 ppm) of LC50 (15.13 ppm) of malathion for 28 days, followed by a postexposure recovery period for the same time. The hematological parameters were examined after 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of exposure as well as after the postexposure recovery time. Except in the case of the control group (0% of malathion), the obtained results revealed that malathion exposure resulted in significantly (p<0.05) higher prevalence and severity of micronucleus and lower values of Hb, PCV, and RBC and significantly higher values of WBC in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The values of blood glucose, MCV, MCH, and MCHC showed mixed trends during the experiment. During the recovery period, all blood parameters (micronucleus, glucose, Hb, PCV, RBC, WBC, MCV, MCH, and MCHC) partially recovered, which means that the recovery period was not long enough for the organisms to recover from the previous exposure. The study thus confirms that hematology is a sensitive indicator for fish to detect toxicity caused by different chemicals. Changes in these parameters can provide useful information about environmental conditions and risk assessment of aquatic organisms.

AB  - High azoxystrobin (AZO), difenoconazole (DFZ), and imidacloprid (IMD) pesticide removal rates in sixteen bench-scale experiments concerning tomato washing water treatment were obtained through a UVC/H2O2 advanced oxidative process. Experimental conditions ([H2O2](0)) and irradiance (E-UVC) were optimized for higher degradation rates (pseudo-first-order reaction). To consider both economic aspects and environmental impacts when defining the treatment technology, as well as technological requirements, this study applied a multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to assess and differentiate similar UVC/H2O2 process configurations. This allowed for the identification of the cheapest experimental arrangement with the lowest associated environmental impacts, coupled to the highest degradation rate (k(IMD)). After consulting experts to determine the importance of the applied criteria and measuring alternative performances, experiment E7 ([H2O2](0) = 43.5 mg L-1; E-UVC = 15.0 W m(-2); k(IMD) = 0.236 s(-1)) was determined as meeting the three criteria in a balanced manner. Although E7 ' s technological performance regarding degradation rate did not achieve the best individual result, it presented the lowest impacts and costs among the analyzed series, although alternatives are sensitive to decision-maker priorities. This study considered different factors of a process displaying potential industrial applications still in the design stage to achieve a more efficient and balanced solution.

AB  - Temperate soils are threatened by degradation and soil organic matter (SOM) loss due to a combination of geomorphology, soil types, and anthropic pressure. In 54 sites in Northern Italy, characterized by different land uses, climates, geological substrates, and soils, we assessed (i) the soil quality, (ii) the SOM accumulation/degradation patterns, and (iii) whether land use and related soil management practices are sustainable based on changes in soil quality. Soil samples from the 0-15 and 15-30 cm deep layers were collected and analyzed for the soil parameters recommended by the FAO (bulk density, pH, organic and microbial C, total N, and soil respiration rate) and for the chemical SOM pools. Parameters related to the efficient use of soil microbial C were also calculated. The findings showed that agricultural lands where organic material was added had good soil quality and used microbial C efficiently. Reclaimed peaty soils degraded because the conditions were too stressful for the soil microbial biomass as supported by high metabolic quotient and the low values of mineralization quotient, microbial quotient, and soil biofertility index. Conservative management practices carried out in chestnuts were found to have a decreased soil degradation risk. An investigation of the soil parameters recommended by the FAO can be used to evaluate sustainable practices and soil quality on microbial activity and SOM dynamics.

AB  - In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) initiated a program for the re-evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavor ingredients. This publication, the sixth in the series, will summarize the re-evaluation of eight NFCs whose constituent profiles are characterized by significant amounts of eucalyptol and/or other cyclic ethers. This re-evaluation was based on a procedure first published in 2005 and subsequently updated in 2018 that evaluates the safety of naturally occurring mixtures for their intended use as flavoring ingredients. The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of the NFC intended for commerce and the organization of its chemical constituents into welldefined congeneric groups. The safety of the NFC is evaluated using the well-established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept in addition to data on absorption, metabolism and toxicology of the constituents of the congeneric groups and the NFC under evaluation. Eight NFCs derived from the Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, Origanum, Laurus, Rosmarinus and Salvia genera were affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under their conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients based on an evaluation of each NFC and the constituents and congeneric groups therein.

AB  - Long-term protection of arid ecosystems changes the vegetation and soil structures. The quantification of aboveground biomass and carbon content are among the principal indicators to evaluate these changes. Most methods used to quantify these parameters are costly, time consuming and destructive. In this paper, two non-destructive methods were compared: digital image processing and biometric measurements. Aboveground biomass and carbon content of five perennial shrubs were studied inside and outside Sidi Toui National Park, southern Tunisia. The effect of long-term protection on aboveground biomass and carbon content was assessed. The main results indicated that both methods provided similar aboveground biomass and carbon values. Aboveground biomass and carbon content were strongly correlated with canopy cover and biovolume (R-2 > 0.7). Positive linear relationships were found for all the studied species. Apart from the large canopy cover of Haloxylon schmittianum and Haloxylon scoparium, the obtained results showed that long-term protection had no significant effect on aboveground biomass and carbon content for the other species. These results suggest that digital charting technique is an accurate method for assessing rangeland productivity in a timely and cost-efficient manner and that long-term protection is not always suitable for enhancing carbon content and therefore ecosystem resilience under climate change conditions.

AB  - Ferrimagnetic greigite (Fe3S4) is widespread in the sedimentary environment. Despite abundant reports of greigite occurrence in marine and lacustrine deposits, its formation mechanisms in deltaic deposits remain poorly studied. Here we investigate greigite in Holocene Yangtze River Delta deposits using granulometric, magnetic, and geochemical methods. The studied cores consist of tidal river, estuary, shallow marine, and delta facies in ascending order. The greigite-bearing layers are found predominantly in the accreting tidal flat facies during the transgression stage and secondarily in the shallow marine facies during the regression stage of the delta's Holocene development. These sedimentary intervals have a higher total sulfur (TS) content and TS to total organic carbon ratios (TS/TOC) suggesting the accumulation of iron sulfides, including greigite, under reducing estuarine and shallow marine conditions. The greigite-bearing layers in the tidal flat facies have lower Sr/Ba ratios, in comparison to the shallow marine facies, indicating a lower salinity environment. Supported by the dating results, it is suggested that the higher sedimentation rate of the tidal flat facies, caused by rapid sea-level rise during the early Holocene, favors the formation and preservation of greigite. Our results indicate that the magnetic detection of greigite provides a simple and useful tool for inferring salinity and sedimentation rate changes, and hence better an understanding of the heterogeneity of depositional processes in Holocene delta environments.

AB  - The emergence of many new food products on the market with need of consumers to constantly monitor their quality until consuming, in addition to the necessity for reducing food corruption during preservation time, have led to the development of some modern packaging technologies such as intelligent packaging (IP) and active packaging (AP). The benefits of IP are detecting defects, quality monitoring and tracking the packaged food products to control the storage conditions from the production stage to the consumption stage by using various sensors and indicators such as time-temperature indicators (TTIs), gas indicators, humidity sensors, optical, calorimetric and electrochemical biosensors. While, AP helps to increase the shelf-life of products by using absorbing and diffusion systems for various materials like carbon dioxide, oxygen, and ethanol. However, there are some important issues over these emerging technologies including cost, marketability, consumer acceptance, safety and organoleptic quality of the food and emphatically environmental safety concerns. Therefore, future researches should be conducted to solve these problems and to prompt applications of IP and AP in the food industry. This paper reviews the latest innovations in these advanced packaging technologies and their applications in food industry. The IP systems namely indicators, barcoding techniques, radio frequency identification systems, sensors and biosensor are reviewed and then the latest innovations in AP methods including scavengers, diffusion systems and antimicrobial packaging are reviewed in detail.

AB  - Nowadays, the concept of innovative development is a generally accepted approach to promoting social and economic development paradigm both at global and national level. However, the rapid changes in external and internal conditions in relation to science and innovation caused the need to integrate innovative priorities with environmental imperatives to support sustainable development of modern society. Thereby, the above-mentioned tendencies are also highly widespread at local (regional) level, because both innovation and environmental practices play an essential role for social development, economic growth, improved productivity and competitiveness, and improved quality of life. Thereby, research problem lays upon the regional environmental systems and their influence at innovative development in Ukraine. The paper aims to provide scientific support on environmental systems development and their connection with innovative development indicators at the regional level. The research methodology is based on official statistical data on Ukrainian economy innovativeness analysis during the last ten years. The environmental component is analyzed at the regional level that allowed us to rank Ukrainian regions in accordance with the level of their environmental responsibility, propose a measure of transformation to their strategies. As the result, the groups of regional environmental strategies were defined in accordance with criteria of their effectiveness and need of transformation. Thus, the research highlights the special status of environmental economy, based on its specific characteristics and influences at innovative development, including network effects, the ability to convert environmental and innovative benefits into significant social effects, hybrid and multiplicative.

AB  - We review the potential for applying traits-based approaches to freshwater testate amoeba, a diverse protist group that are abundant in lakes and are valuable ecological indicators. We investigated the efficacy of geometric morphometric analysis to define Arcellinida test size and shape indices that could summarize freshwater testate amoeba community dynamics along a temporal gradient of eutrophication in Loch Leven, Scotland (United Kingdom). A cluster analysis of test size and shape indices yielded three clusters, each dominated by a single shape: elongate, spherical and ovoid. When plotted stratigraphically, we observed increases in spherical tests, decreases in elongate tests and shrinking of test size coeval with eutrophication in Loch Leven. Decreases in the elongate cluster may reflect benthic conditions with reduced oxygen levels, while increases in the spherical cluster are likely associated with an expanding macrophyte community that promoted pelagic and epibiotic life habits. Shrinking of test size may be a stress response to eutrophication and/or warming temperatures. Tracking community dynamics using test size and shape indices was found to be as effective as using species-based approaches to summarize key palaeolimnological changes, with the added benefits of being free from taxonomic bias and error. The approach thus shows significant potential for future studies of aquatic community change in nutrient impacted lakes.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cysts are known to be potential seed banks which have an essential role in providing bloom history and also serve as useful indicators of eutrophication in marine environments. The present study is focused on the surface distribution of dinoflagellate cysts along the salinity gradient in two tropical estuaries, namely Chapora and Sal in Goa along the West coast of India. Surface sediments and water samples were collected monthly from February 2016-March 2017 which included all three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). A total of sixteen species of dinoflagellate cysts belonging to the order, Gymnodiniales, Gonyaulacales, and Peridiniales were recorded in the surface sediments. Cysts of heterotrophic dinoflagellates dominated the assemblage in both estuaries. Based on Redundancy Analysis (RDA), it was observed that the distribution of the dinoflagellate cysts were influenced by various physico-chemical parameters in both estuaries with salinity and grain size being the main explanatory variable. Nitrate limitation is noted to be a triggering factor for dinoflagellate cyst formation. Also, yessotoxin producer species, such as Gonyaulax spinifera, encountered in both estuaries showed an inverse relationship with nitrate concentration. This suggests that, high nitrate input in these estuaries might lead to excystment of Gonyaulax spinifera eventually leading to harmful blooms under eutrophic conditions.

AB  - Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) is natural source of valuable components such as phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanins. Anthocyanin is normally used in the food technology to replace synthetic pigments as well as medicinal properties due to antioxidants. Microwave irradiation is a feasible green solvent extraction method receiving great attention as it utilizes solvent at elevated temperature and controlled pressure conditions. Microwave extraction emerges as a promising inexpensive, simple and efficient technique. In our research, various variable like microwave power (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 W), microwave frequency (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 GHz), the microwave irradiation duration (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 min), liquid to solid ratio (water: material, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1), extraction temperature (50, 55, 60, 65, 70 degrees C), number of extraction cycles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) influencing to the microwave-assisted extraction of phytochemicals in roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) calyx were thoroughly examined. Total total phenolic (mg GAE/ 100 g), total flavonoid (mg GE/ 100 g), anthocyanin (mg/100 g) were key indicators to define the optimal variable. Our results revealed that microwave power at 80 W, frequency 40 GHz, duration 15 min, liquid to solid ratio 4:1, temperature 55 degrees C, 4 cycles of extraction were appropriate for extraction of phytochemical components inside roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) calyx.

AB  - Central Andes (33 degrees S) represent a water-scarce region. During arid years, glacier runoff may constitute the main hydrological input at warm season and hence a steadfast deglacierization may represent a decrease in the regional water-budget. Ice-retreat enables landscape transitions from proglacial towards a paraglacial environment, allowing the formation of newly formed cryogenic deposits. Ice-surface changes in the Central Andes (33 S), including the high-mountain areas from Aconcagua, Mendoza and Maipo basins (Argentina and Chile), were studied using digitalized maps, aerial photographs, Landsat (1-8) and Sentinel-2A data for the period between 1956 and 2015. Band ratio and Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) methods were tested using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A data for comparison. Geomorphological changes were assessed at Monos de Agua catchment (2750-4000 m a.s.l.) in the Aconcagua basin (Chile) as a regionally representative landscape transition case. Regional glacier shrinkage of 46 +/- 5% between 1956 and 2016 was observed for the Central Andean sub-basins in both Argentina and Chile at 33 degrees S. Overall, 107.1 +/- 5 km(2) of newly exposed surfaces are subject to permafrost conditions. Such insights raise concern in terms of current and future environmental assessments for newly formed cryospheric elements in water scarce regions.

AB  - Periphyton has been recognized as an important element in aquatic food chains due to its role in primary production. More recently, it has been used as bioindicator of contamination in reservoirs since biofilm analysis can support in understanding the impacts of bottom-up contaminants to the reservoirs. Copper (Cu) is one of these pollutants which has been used as an algicide; it accumulates in the sediment and can be released to the water column, causing harm to various aquatic organisms, including the periphytic biofilm. In this work periphyton cultivated in the laboratory was exposed to copper, using concentrations from 0.013 to 0.15 mg Cu L-1 over 15 days under controlled conditions (temperature, light, and oxygenation). Different physical-chemical and ecological parameters were measured in order to describe the effects of Cu on the community, which included alterations in ash-free dry mass and chlorophyll concentration, as well as an earlier photosynthetically light saturation point. The results reflected different ecological behavior with modifications in the community composition and greater cyanobacteria dominance like abundance of species with mucilage as the Cu concentration increased. Furthermore, some species of diatoms were not found when the water was contaminated with Cu. This disturbance in the ecological composition of periphyton affects significantly the food chain due to the unpalatability of tolerant species and/or the bioaccumulation of Cu which may be transferred to other organisms potentially causing toxicity to primary consumers.

AB  - The integrated forest ecosystem model ForSAFE-Veg was used to simulate soil processes and understory vegetation composition at threesugar maple, beech, yellow birchhardwood forest sites in the Northeastern United States (one at Hubbard Brook, NH, and two at Bear Brook, ME). Input data were pooled from a variety of sources and proved coherent and consistent. While the biogeochemical component ForSAFE was used with limited calibration, the ground vegetation composition module Veg was calibrated to field releves. Evaluating different simulated ecosystem indicators (soil solution chemistry, tree biomass, ground vegetation composition) showed that the model performed comparably well regardless of the site's soil condition, climate, and amounts of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition, with the exception of failing to capture tree biomass decline at Hubbard Brook. The model performed better when compared with annual observation than monthly data. The results support the assumption that the biogeochemical model ForSAFE can be used with limited calibration and provide reasonable confidence, while the vegetation community composition module Veg requires calibration if the individual plant species are of interest. The study welcomes recent advances in empirically explaining the responses of hardwood forests to nutrient imbalances and points to the need for more research.

AB  - Bacterial community isolated from different units of a Drinking Water Treatment Plant (DWTP) including pre-ozonation unit (POU), the effluent-sludge mixture of the sedimentation unit (ESSU) and top-sand layer water sample from the filtration unit (TSFU) were acclimatized separately in the microcystinleucine arginine (MC-LR)-rich environment to evaluate MC-LR biodegradation. Maximum biodegradation efficiency of 97.2 +/- 8.7% was achieved by the acclimatized-TSFU bacterial community followed by 72.1 +/- 6.4% and 86.2 +/- 7.3% by acclimatized-POU and acclimatized-ESSU bacterial community, respectively. Likewise, the non-acclimatized bacterial community showed similar biodegradation efficiency of 71.1 +/- 7.37%, 86.7 +/- 3.19% and 94.35 +/- 10.63% for TSFU, ESSU and POU, respectively, when compared to the acclimatized ones. However, the biodegradation rate increased 1.5-folds for acclimatized versus non acclimatized conditions. The mass spectrometry studies on MC-LR degradation depicted hydrolytic linearization of cyclic MC-LR along with the formation of small peptide fragments including Adda molecule that is linked to the reduced toxicity (qualitative toxicity analysis). This was further confirmed quantitatively by using Rhizobium meliloti as a bioindicator. The acclimatized-TSFU bacterial community comprised of novel MC-LR degrading strains, Chryseobacterium sp. and Pseudomonas fragi as confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ventilation and air conditioning systems are emerging as the major energy consumers in low energy buildings. The objective of this paper is to present new methodology for assessment of Air Handling Units (AHUs) taking into account the variations of reference temperature. The methodology using the concept of coenthalpy, developed for heat exchangers and published by the authors previously has been used. Four AHUs that comprise energy transfer devices, such as: Water-to-Air Heater (WAH), Heat Recovery Exchanger (HRE) and Heat Pump (HP) have been investigated. Thermodynamic parameters including Coefficient of Performance (COP), universal and functional exergy efficiencies have been used to compare AHUs and to calculate the exergy destruction in AHU components at variable environment temperature -30 degrees C... + 10 degrees C. The results of this study show that using HRE the COP and exergy efficiencies are significantly better compared with AHU without HRE. Using the HRE of higher effectiveness, the thermodynamic indicators can be improved considerably. The study shows that AHUs equipped with HP with advanced control method and HRE are more advantageous compared with other investigated AHUs.
   The presented methodology could have practical application for evaluating of energy and exergy efficiency of AHUs at different reference temperatures when designing HVAC systems and implementing optimum control methods.

AB  - The micropaleontological study (radiolarians and foraminifera) of the sediment core AMK-340, Reykjanes Ridge, North Atlantic, combined with the radiocarbon dating and oxygen and carbon isotopic record, provided data for the reconstruction of the summer paleotemperature across the upper 100 meters water depth range, and paleoenvironments during the Termination I in the age interval of 14.5-8 ka. The response of the main microfossil species to the paleoceanographic changes within the BOlling-AllerOd (BA) warming, the Younger Dryas (YD) cold event and final transition to the warm Holocene, was different. The BA warming was well captured by the radiolarian and benthic foraminiferal records, but not the planktic one. The high abundances of the cold-water radiolarian species Amphimelissa setosa as a Greenland/Iceland Sea indicator marked a cooling at the end of the BA and at the start of the YD at 13.2-12.3 ka. The micropaleontological and isotopic data together with the paleotemperature estimates for the Reykjanes Ridge at 60 degrees N document that, after the warm BA, the middle YD ca. 12.5-12.2 ka was the next significant step toward the Holocene warming. The start of the Holocene interglacial conditions was reflected in large representation of the microfossils being indicators of the open boreal North Atlantic environments indicating increasing warmth.

AB  - Seasonal variations and distributions of dissolved carbohydrate concentrations at the Izmir Bay were investigated with salinity, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels to understand their relationships. Samples were collected from surface, subsurface and bottom depths at seven stations. DOC concentrations ranged from 32.2 to 244.2 mu mol/L, and in general, DOC levels increased from winter to summer, then slightly decreased in autumn. Monosaccharide (MCHO), polysaccharide (PCHO) and total dissolved carbohydrate (TDCHO) levels were found between 0.7-8.3, 0.7-19.5, and 2.6-24.6 mu mol/L. DOC, MCHO, PCHO and TDCHO levels were found higher in middle-inner bays, under the influence of anthropogenic inputs, compared to outer bay. Seasonal changes of MCHO/DOC, PCHO/DOC and TDCHO/DOC ratios were statistically significant (p<0.05) and the ratios showed decrease trends from winter to summer-autumn seasons. Distributions of TDCHO/DOC ratios at wide ranges (2.5%-42.3%) indicated the presence of newly forming and degrading fractions of DOM. According to results of factor analysis, Chl a, MCHO and TDCHO were explained in the same factor groups. In conclusion, the results showed that dissolved carbohydrate levels in the Izmir Bay might be influenced by biological processes and terrestrial/anthropogenic inputs.

AB  - The article presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of formation of professional identity in conditions of uncertainty and increasing multidimensionality of professional and educational space. The attention is focused on the fact that the dynamics of social processes is expressed in changing the requirements for the content and quality of work, the complexity of professional training. The multifactorial nature of professional development leads to the complication of the strategy of building a professional trans-perspective and requires a specially organized acmeological support of the identification process at the stage of vocational education. Within the theoretical review the definition of professional identity with the description of its structure is given, the author's definition of professional trans-perspective is proposed. An important part of the article is the results of an empirical study of the features of professional identity and professional trans-perspective of students who are future teachers of vocational training. The interrelation of the main characteristics of professional trans-perspective - length, event density with indicators of professional identity: maturity, formation, activity of professional position, educational and professional plans - is revealed. Thus, the characteristics of professional identity can be considered as predictors for predicting a person's professional future. In the final part, it is proposed to intensify the work on the development of professional identity of second-year students by supplementing the curriculum with elective modules aimed at the deficit aspects of professional self-determination.

LA  - English
AB  - The contribution of vegetables to food security and economic development in Colombia, as well as to environmental problems worldwide, justifies the interest to design sustainable production strategies for the agro-chain. This study was developed to evaluate the effect of the application of essential oils and agricultural inputs in chili peppers, beans and eggplants in Codazzi, Cesar, Colombia. The methodology included the compatibility analysis between pesticides used in these vegetables, and Lippia alba and Cymbopogon citratus oils in relation to their biocidal effect in vitro on native strains of Macrophomina phaseolina, Phytophthora capsici and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Applications of thiabendazole in an individual basis and combined with oils were carried out in the field. Physicochemical and microbiological indicators of soil, pests and diseases incidence and crop yield were measured. Oils controlled up to 97% of plant pathogens in vitro and exhibited compatibility with carbendazim and thiabendazole. In the field, up to 67% of disease control was observed with C. citratus + thiabendazole compared to the control (p = 0.00), yields were close to the regional average, and better microbiological and physicochemical soil conditions were observed. In conclusion, there are differences in the edaphic effect between treatments, as the agrochemical and the oil combinations were more favorable than the individual effect of each product on the variables evaluated. The above exhorts to continue soil evaluations with oils to elucidate the duration of the described effects.

AB  - Solar greenhouses are well-established and very popular in the north of China as a way of meeting the demand for fresh local winter vegetables. Nonetheless, they are more susceptible to meteorological disasters, such as fog, haze and cold temperatures. A meteorological risk management system that includes disaster forecasting and control is a useful tool to efficiently capture long-term and up-to-the-minute environmental fluctuations inside greenhouses. Based on the concept of the meteorological disaster warning model, this study has developed a meteorological risk management system built upon a browser/server framework and mobile internet to provide precision agriculture (PA) services with large-scale, long-term, scalable and real-time data collection capabilities for solar greenhouse vegetables. Early warning indicators were established for the main meteorological hazards to winter-spring vegetables in solar greenhouses, including low temperature and sparse sunlight, downy mildew, grey mildew and powdery mildew induced by unfavorable meteorological conditions. The system could provide a valuable framework for farmers and agrometeorological officials in analyzing the relationships between vegetable damage dynamics and meteorological events. Having been applied in Beijing and Tianjin, the system has correctly forecast meteorological disaster and diseases caused by long-term fog and haze from November 2015. Based on the analysis carried out, improved meteorological risk management and a more accurate decision-making strategy can be developed to assist PA in combating meteorological disaster.

AB  - As the urban population increases, the land area occupied by cities has increased at an even higher rate. Given this trend, urban warming has become a global phenomenon that affects outdoor comfort, energy consumption and air quality. Urban climate researchers assess cities' micro-climate behavior in order to be able to propose a suitable urban design. In this sense, urban planners still face a lack of simple tools to evaluate thermal behavior and the comfort conditions of an urban space. This study aims to develop a design tool, which was developed from collected field surveys in a non-forested urban canyon and in 18 representatives of forested ones in Mendoza, Argentina. A linear multivariate thermal comfort model called the COMFA-tool was created and performs well (R-2 = 0.86). The predictive capability of the developed tool was tested. Urban forest variables contribute up to 60% of comfort improvement. The study discusses how confusing it can be to use a solely morphological indicator in forested arid cities (i.e., H/W). Additionally, daytime thermal comfort and nighttime cooling were contrasted. The results presented lead us to think of a compromise solution in terms of designs of urban canyons. We encourage urban planners to use these design tools in order to improve the microclimate behavior of cities.

AB  - Background: Air pollution is a major global environmental risk factor. Since people spend most of their time indoors, the sole measure of outdoor concentrations is not sufficient to assess total exposure to air pollution. Therefore, the arising interest by the international community to indoor-outdoor relationships has led to the development of various techniques for the study of emission and exchange parameters among ambient and non-ambient pollutants. However, a standardised method is still lacking due to the complex release and dispersion of pollutants and the site conditions among studies. Methods: This review attempts to fill this gap to some extent by focusing on the analysis of the variety of site-specific approaches for the assessment of particulate matter in work and life environments. Results: First, the main analogies and differences between indoor and outdoor particles emerging from several studies are briefly described. Commonly-used indicators, sampling methods, and other approaches are compared. Second, recommendations for further studies based on recent results in order to improve the assessment and management of those issues are provided. Conclusions: This review is a step towards a comprehensive understanding of indoor and outdoor exposures which may stimulate the development of innovative tools for further epidemiological and multidisciplinary research.

AB  - The highest densities and largest areas of Fagus grandifolia subsp. mexicana in Mexico grow in the cloud forest of the state of Hidalgo. Although this taxon is endangered, there is little information about its population structure. This study provides data on the structure of heights, diameters and ages of Fagus in three populations in Hidalgo. Additionally, information was obtained on the structure of the beech forests, whose canopy is dominated by Fagus. At each locality, three to five 400 m(2) sample plots, depending on the size of the respective forest, were randomly selected. Within each plot, density and basal area of each species of tree and shrub with diameter greater than 2.5 cm (1.30 m) were estimated. At the species level, populations are dynamic, with a high percentage of young individuals; however, at one of the localities, changes have occurred in the last decade due to anthropogenic activity, and the structure of sizes and diameters in the youngest age categories has changed. Diameter was a good indicator of the age of the trees. At the community level, the dominance of Fagus and other species differed between localities, which is probably related to the degree of disturbance. Population and community structure are related and could be considered as indicators of changes in environmental conditions in the recent past and today.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity along the Velhas River (Sao Francisco River basin) has destabilized the banks of the river channel across an urban fragment. To improve the physical stabilization, the base of the slope was stabilized with urban construction waste. After this, the slope was revegetated with native species and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) inoculation was applied with a successfully restoration of the vegetative cover and ecological functions. This study aims to evaluate the role of the AMF population in the soil aggregation and stabilization of the revegetated slope. The soil aggregation was higher at the experimental site than at the disturbed site, especially under the AMF inoculation. The aggregates improvement was accompanied by an increase of soil humic acid and glomalin contents 24 months after the transplantation despite a flood impact 12 months after the transplantation. A scatter plot based on Principal Component Analysis of aggregates Showed that the preserved site samples clustered with most of those from experimental site. However, some samples from experimetal site were found between those from preserved and disturbed sites. This result shows that the recovering site is evolving toward the conditions of the preserved site and that the rehabilitation process is in an intermediate phase related to the aggregate formation. The AMF inoculation of woody species was indicated in the rehabilitation procedures.

AB  - To construct an effective method to analyze the combustion process of dual fuel engines at low loads, effects of combustion boundaries on the combustion process of an electronically controlled diesel natural gas dual-fuel engine at low loads were investigated. Three typical combustion modes, including h, in and n, appeared under different combustion boundaries. In addition, the time-sequenced characteristic and the heat release rate-imbalanced characteristic were found in the dual fuel engine combustion process. To quantify these characteristics, two quantitative indicators, including the TSC (time-sequenced coefficient) and the HBC (HRR-balanced coefficient) were defined. The results show that increasing TSC and HBC can decrease HC (hydrocarbon) emissions and improve the BTE (brake thermal efficiency) significantly. The engine with the n combustion mode can obtain the highest BTE and the lowest HC emissions, followed by m, and then h. However, the combustion process of the engine will deteriorate sharply if boundary conditions are not strictly controlled in the n combustion mode. Based on the n combustion mode, advancing the start of diesel injection significantly, using large EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) rate and appropriately intake throttling can effectively reduce HC emissions and improve the BTE of dual fuel engines at low loads with relatively high natural gas PES (percentage energy substitution).

AB  - The integration of knowledge from stakeholders and the public at large is seen as one of the biggest process-related barriers during the scoping phase of EIA application in transport planning. While the academic literature offers abundant analyses, discussions and suggestions how to overcome this problem, the proposed solutions are yet to be adequately tested in practice. In order to address this gap, we test the effectiveness of a set of interventions and trigger mechanisms for improving different aspects of knowledge integration. The interventions are tested in an experiential study with two sequential cases, representing '' close-to-real-life '' conditions, in the context of two cities in Andalusia, Spain. In general terms, the participants perceived that the integration of knowledge improved during the simulation of the EIA scoping phase. Certain shortcomings were also discussed, fundamentally related to how the time spent during the scoping phase was crucial to lead an effective learning process between the involved people. The study concludes with a reflection on the effectiveness of the tested interventions according to similarities and differences obtained from the two experiential case studies, as well as with a discussion of the potential to generate new knowledge through the use of experiential studies in EIA practice.

AB  - Occurrence of animals in an area and the size of territories they occupy is a function of resource availability and the environmental conditions in that area. Territory location in birds is often determined by availability of nesting habitat and we investigate whether this is the case for the little-studied Northern Anteater-chat Myrmecocichla aethiops. Territory size and location were mapped over two months in 2012 at 25 different sites where the birds occurred in central Nigeria and compared to 25 random sites where they did not, 500 m away. Vegetation variables, invertebrate abundance indicators, anthropogenic variables (availability of nest sites) and bird community components were measured and compared with adjoining areas (500 m away) from which the birds were absent in order to determine important factors determining territory location and size. Territories were 1.23 ha (SE 0.14) in size and were widely separated and so non-contiguous. Increasing numbers of abandoned wells, ant nests and termite mounds increased the probability of territory occupation. Territory size increased with the number of anteater-chats but decreased with increasing number of ant nests and overall bird diversity that were probably proxies for habitat quality. Overall, choice of preferred areas for the Northern Anteater-chat was centred on nesting sites and then habitat quality and group size probably determined territory size.

AB  - Many crops contain domestication genes that are generally considered to lower fitness of cropwild hybrids in the wild environment. Transgenes placed in close linkage with such genes would be less likely to spread into a wild population. Therefore, for environmental risk assessment of GM crops, it is important to know whether genomic regions with such genes exist, and how they affect fitness. We performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses on fitness(-related) traits in two different field environments employing recombinant inbred lines from a cross between cultivated Lactuca sativa and its wild relative Lactuca serriola. We identified a region on linkage group 5 where the crop allele consistently conferred a selective advantage (increasing fitness to 212% and 214%), whereas on linkage group 7, a region conferred a selective disadvantage (reducing fitness to 26% and 5%), mainly through delaying flowering. The probability for a putative transgene spreading would therefore depend strongly on the insertion location. Comparison of these field results with greenhouse data from a previous study using the same lines showed considerable differences in QTL patterns. This indicates that care should be taken when extrapolating experiments from the greenhouse, and that the impact of domestication genes has to be assessed under field conditions.

AB  - We used comet-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the model plant species Crepis capillaris following exposure of seedlings to maleic hydrazide (MH). FISH with 5S and 25S rDNA probes was applied to comets obtained under alkaline conditions to establish whether these DNA regions were preferentially involved in comet tail formation. MH treatment induced significant fragmentation of nuclear DNA and of rDNA loci. A 24-h post-treatment recovery period allowed a partial reversibility of MH-induced damage on nuclear and rDNA regions. Analyses of FISH signals demonstrated that rDNA sequences were always involved in tail formation and that 5S rDNA was more frequently present in the tail than 25S rDNA, regardless of treatment. The involvement of 25S rDNA in nucleolus formation and differences in chromatin structure between the two loci may explain the different susceptibility of the 25S and 5S rDNA regions to migrate into the tail. This work is the first report on the application of FISH to comet preparations from plants to analyze the distribution and repair of DNA damage within specific genomic regions after mutagenic treatment. Moreover, our work suggests that comet-FISH in plants may be a useful tool for environmental monitoring assessment. Environ. Mol. Mutagen., 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The study of aqueous alteration of kamacite in CM chondrites provides insight on the conditions, products, and relative timing of aqueous alteration. We studied unaltered, partially altered, and fully altered kamacite grains from Murray, Murchison, Cold Bokkeveld, and Nogoya using optical microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. From textual evidence and chemical analysis, we established three separate microchemical environments. 1) In a microchemical environment with a high S activity, kamacite alters to form tochilinite, P-bearing sulfides, eskolaite, and schreibersite. Mass balance calculations show that 81% of the Fe in kamacite is removed from the alteration region, making it available for the formation of other minerals or Fe-rich aureoles. The release of Fe can alter the mesostasis of type-I chondrules forming cronstedtite. 2) In a microchemical environment with a high Si activity and a low S activity, kamacite alters to form cronstedtite with small accessory sulfide inclusions. 3) A microchemical environment with limited S and Si activity results in kamacite alteration forming magnetite. The resulting magnetite retains associated Ni that can distinguish it from precipitated magnetite. In addition, the accessory phases of pentlandite and apatite can be formed if S or Ca are present. Finally, we note that small tochilinite grains in the matrix lack typical Ni, P, and Co levels, suggesting that they did not form from kamacite but possibly by sulfidization of magnetite.

AB  - Natural and man-made brittle layers embedded in a weaker matrix and subjected to layer-parallel extension typically develop an array of opening-mode fractures with a remarkably regular spacing. This spacing often scales with layer thickness, and it decreases as extension increases until fracture saturation is reached. Existing analytical one-dimensional (1-D) 'full-slip' models, which assume that interfacial slip occurs over the entire length of the fracture-bound blocks, predict that the ratio of fracture spacing to layer thickness at saturation is proportional to the ratio of layer tensile to interface shear strength (T/tau). Using 2-D discontinuum mechanical models run for conditions appropriate to layered rocks, we show that fracture spacing at saturation decreases linearly with decreasing T/tau ratio, as predicted by 1-D models. At low T/tau ratios (ca. <3.0), however, interfacial slip is suppressed and the heterogeneous 2-D stress distribution within fracture-bound blocks controls further fracture nucleation, as predicted by an existing 2-D 'fracture infill criterion'. The applicability of the two theories is hence T/tau ratio dependent. Our models illustrate that fracture spacing in systems permitting interfacial slip is not necessarily an indicator of fracture system maturity. Fracture spacing is expected to decrease with increasing overburden pressure and decreasing layer tensile strength. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Decline of native area, population size and breeding herds are indicators of imminent danger of breed extinction in the near future. Because of occurrence and continuation of these conditions for Markhoz goat population, this research was conducted to determine its spread, latest demographic data and the most important criteria and degree of endangerment. Data were collected through interview with the herders and monitoring the flocks in their native area and other locations in mating season, Distribution map was prepared using GIS and demographic data were used to evaluate Degree of Endangerment (DE). In the latest year, population size, the number of breeding females and males, effective population size and inbreeding rate were 2456, 1332, 70, 266 heads and 0.19% in each generation, respectively. Except for inbreeding rate, other criteria in 2009 were lower than those in 2008. In this study, herders mentioned economic factors as the main reason for decreasing of the population. Investigation of criteria in four major evaluation systems to determine DE showed that Markhoz goat is in demographic and geographical risks and imminent danger of decreasing variation within breed. Intense concentration of 77% of its population within a circle of 7 km radius has exposed the breed at the risk of epidemic diseases and other natural disasters. Thus, the primary conservational measures by the government as well as complimentary studies for providing comprehensive conservation program appear to be necessary.

AB  - According to explicit monitoring theories, the phenomenon of choking under pressure is due to actors focusing their attention on the execution of the skill. This step-by-step perceptually guided control may then interfere with automatic execution. In order to examine the changes in control at the sensorimotor level, we examined the rhythmic task of ball bouncing which affords detailed quantification of indicators of control based on previous research. The hypothesis was that under psychological pressure perceptually guided control should lead to decreased performance due to over-emphasis on closed-loop control and decreased compensatory control. In two experiments of different difficulty psychological stress was induced via setting up a fake competition. Results showed that, contrary to the hypothesis, performance accuracy and consistency improved together with an increase in compensatory control. Indicators for open- and closed-loop processes did not change. Only under more challenging conditions in Experiment 2, enhanced performance under pressure was accompanied by more active, closed-loop and less passive control. The results are discussed in light of task demands and the continuous rhythmic nature of the task: in more challenging tasks, control appears to be more prone to disturbance due to psychological stress. The different control demands in continuous rhythmic tasks may be less prone to interference due to psychological stress than in discrete tasks.

AB  - Diversified continental, marginal-marine and marine epicontinental deposits in Poland of Early Jurassic age yielded unusually rich palynomacerals. Numerous parameters, such as the presence of acritarchs and dinofiagellate cysts, spore/bisaccate pollen grain ratio, content of terrestrial phytoclasts, degree of oxidation, presence of tetrads and sporangia, degree of palynomorph alteration, presence and character of amorphous organic matter, presence of epibionts on palynomorphs, were collectively found as indicative of certain palynofacies. The ratio of spores and bisaccate pollen grains significantly depends on the climatic conditions where also seasonal changes may influence the local characteristics of palynofacies. However, the ratio also strongly reflects the local depositional environment which may vary regionally and spore/bisaccate pollen grain ratio can be taken as a general indicator of distance from the shore. Early Jurassic palynomacerals from the Polish Basin are strongly dominated by terrestrial elements, marine palynomacerals occur in significant quantities only in Pliensbachian deposits in Pomerania Western Poland. Charcoal is an important component of palynomacerals. Due to its resistance to biogenic degradation and buoyancy, charcoal produced by extensive wildfires was widely re-deposited and concentrated particularly in foreshore to shallow shoreface and delta plain environments. Three types of palynofacies inversions (abnormal palynofacies composition) are discussed. Six main palynofacies types linked to depositional systems previously determined by sedimentological studies have been distinguished providing a robust paleoenvironmental tool for recognition of palynofacies attributed to certain palaeoenvironments.

AB  - Changes in the activities of oxidative enzymes (indole acetic acid oxidase, peroxidase and catalase), endogenous hormones (gibberellic acid (GA3), indole acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinins (AsZeatin), photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids), total carbohydrates, total soluble sugars, amino acid proline and vegetative growth parameters were used as indicators to explain the physiological role of the growth retardant prohexadione-calcium on Vicia faba seedlings 40 days after sowing under salinity stress for 30 days. The obtained results show that soaking faba bean seeds prior to sowing at different concentrations of prohexadione-calcium (0, 10, 20 and 30 ppm) significantly increased the activities of indole acetic acid oxidase (IAA-oxidase) and peroxidase enzymes, but decreased the catalase enzyme activity as compared with their respective control. Application of prohexadione-Ca caused markedly decreases in the endogenous contents of gibberellins and indole acetic acid (IAA) but increased the levels of natural growth inhibitor abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinins in the shoots of faba bean seedlings. All the prohexadione-Ca concentrations increased the contents of amino acid proline, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids), total carbohydrates and total Soluble sugars in faba bean seedlings grown under salt stress. Application of prohexadione-Ca decreased significantly seedling height and shoot fresh weight but significantly increased shoot dry weight.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment of hazardous waste disposal relies, among others, on standardized leaching tests characterized by a strong coupling between diffusion and chemical processes. In that respect, this study shows that reactive transport modelling is a useful tool to extrapolate laboratory results to site conditions characterized by lower solution/solid (L/S) ratios, site specific geometry, infiltration, etc. A cement solidified/stabilized (S/S) waste containing lead is investigated as a typical example. The reactive transport model developed in a previous study to simulate the initial state of the waste as well as laboratory batch and dynamic tests is first summarized. Using the same numerical code (HYTEC), this model is then integrated to a simplified waste disposal scenario assuming a defective cover and rain water infiltration. The coupled evolution of the S/S waste chemistry and the pollutant plume migration are modelled assessing the importance of the cracking state of the monolithic waste. The studied configurations correspond to an undamaged and fully sealed system, a few main fractures between undamaged monoliths and, finally, a dense crack-network in the monoliths. The model considers the potential effects of cracking, first the increase of rain water and carbon dioxide infiltration and, secondly, the increase of L/S ratio and reactive surfaces, using either explicit fracture representation or dual porosity approaches.

AB  - Seasonal fluctuations in salinity are typical in coastal soils due to the intrusion of seawater in the groundwater. We studied the effect of salinity on the microbial and biochemical parameters of the salt-affected soils of the coastal region of Bay of Bengal, Sundarbans, India. The average pH values and average organic C (OC) contents of soils from nine different sites cultivated with rice (Oryza sativa) ranged from 4.8 to 7.8 and from 5.2 to 14.1 g kg(-1), respectively. The average electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECe) during the summer season was about five times higher than that during the monsoon season. Within the nine sites, three soils (S-3, S-4, and S-5) were the most saline. The average microbial biomass C (MBC), average basal soil respiration (BSR), and average fluorescein diacetate hydrolyzing activity (FDHA) were lowest during the summer season, indicating a negative influence of soil salinity. About 59%, 50%, and 20% variation in MBC/OC, FDHA/OC, and BSR/MBC (metabolic quotient, qCO(2)), respectively, which are indicators of environmental stress, could be explained by the variation in ECe. The decrease in MBC and microbial activities with a rise in salinity is probably one of the reasons for the poor crop growth in salt-affected coastal soils.

AB  - Interest in plant nutrient issues for sustainable land application of residuals is increasingly driven by environmental concerns. The indicators of concern are P and N in surface waters, nitrate leaching, and emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases. Federal regulations require residual application rates to be on a N basis at most, and on a P basis when risk of P loss in surface runoff is high. Modeling of mineralization offers the potential for more accurate determinations of potentially available nitrogen (PAN) and quick tests could allow the determination of PAN on residuals immediately before land application. Methods for reducing ammonia emissions from livestock operations and new techniques for quantifying emissions under field conditions are being developed. Calibration and validation of P loss assessment tools is an ongoing concern and the interpretation of edge of field P losses warrants further attention. The solubility of P in residuals and soils can be influenced by various amendments or treatment processes. High available P grains or phytase enzyme supplementation can reduce total and soluble P in animal manures by reducing the need for diet supplementation with inorganic P. The use of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy has identified chemical forms of inorganic P. Considerable progress has been made addressing plant nutrient issues for sustainable land application and interest in this topic will remain strong into the foreseeable future.

AB  - This work assessed the risks associated with the virological quality of tapwater using a molecular analytical tool manageable in a field survey. It combined a daily epidemiological follow-up of digestive morbidity among a panel of volunteers and a microbiological surveillance of drinking water. RT-PCR was used for detection of enterovirus, rotavirus and astrovirus. 712 cases of acute digestive conditions occurred in the 544 volunteers. 38% (9/24) raw water and 23% (10/44) tap water samples were positive for at least one virus marker with 9/10 positive tap water samples complying with bacterial criteria. No statistically significant association was found between the presence of viral markers and observed incidence of digestive morbidity. However, when an outbreak occurred, enterovirus and rotavirus RNA was detected in the corresponding stored tap water samples. Sequencing of the amplified fragments showed that the rotavirus detected was of bovine origin. This work demonstrated that enteric virus markers were common in tapwater of the study communities (characterised by a vulnerable raw water) despite absence of bacterial indicators. Tangential ultrafiltration coupled to RT-PCR allowed a simultaneous and fast detection of the study viruses from environmental samples. This process is a promising tool usable for virological water surveillance, in as much the corresponding know-how is transferred to the field professionals.

AB  - Aim To develop a new method for bioclimate mapping where the vegetation layer is the main source of climate information.
   Location The study area includes four subareas, all situated on the Varangerhalvoya peninsula in Finnmark, north-easternmost Norway (70-71 degrees N). The four subareas were chosen to represent most of the climatic, topographic, geomorphologic and botanic diversity along the arctic-boreal gradient in the area. The four meteorological stations in the area show a climatic gradient with mean July temperature ranging from 10.1 to 12.3 degrees C.
   Methods The new vegetation-based method is based on the fact that most plant species and plant communities both in the Arctic and adjacent areas have a distribution pattern limited by temperature to some extent. The vegetation is mapped using Landsat TM data and a contextual correction process in a geographic information system. The mapped vegetation units are defined as temperature indicators based on their total distribution patterns and the temperature indicator value of their high frequency and dominant species. The indicator value and degree of cover of all thermophilous vegetation units, within each 500 x 500 m study unit, are combined in a Vegetation-based Index of Thermophily, VItm. This new vegetation-based method is based on the same basic idea as a recently published floristic-based method for calculating a Floristic-based Index of Thermophily, FItm. The VItm values are tested by comparison with the FItm values, and temperature data collected in the field during two growing seasons, and the differences are interpreted ecologically.
   Results Twenty-one of the mapped vegetation units were defined as thermophilous and categorized in five groups of temperature indicators. The VItm values showed a strong positive linear relationship with the temperatures measured during the years 2001 and 2002, with r(2) values of 0.79 and 0.85, respectively. The VItm values show a high linear relationship (r(2) = 0.76) with the 71 study units where the FItm values were calculated. As interpreted from the relationship with temperature measurements and FItm values, the vegetation-based method seems to work at a broad range of ecological conditions, with very dry, acidic sites being the most important exception. The VItm values are related to growing degree-days of a normal year, and the four subareas are mapped, showing a diversity of 13 bioclimatic classes. The birch forest line is estimated to occur at about 980 degrees C-days. The results show climatic gradients with temperatures increasing from the cold coast towards the interior, from wind-exposed convex hills towards wind-protected valleys, and from mountain plateaux towards south-facing lowlands. The north-easternmost study site at the coast is positioned within the arctic shrub tundra zone.
   Main conclusions The vegetation-based method shows a strong positive correlation both with measured temperatures and the floristic-based method within a broad range of different ecological conditions. The vegetation-based method has the potential for bioclimatic mapping of large areas in a cost-effective way. The floristic-based method has higher accuracy and is more flexible than the vegetation-based method, and the two methods seem to complement each other.

AB  - The aim of this article was to examine the effect of hybrid nano - coating that could potentially impact the enhancement of heat transfer coefficient of distilled water, Reynolds number, and temperature through a swirl heat exchanger, as well as the indicator of the effect Zeta voltage in the coating process. In this experimental work, type of coating used was Aluminum (Al) + Aluminum oxide Al2O3. Outcomes of study showed that the coating of heat exchanger is much better than without coating in improving the thermal properties for liquids passing through heat exchanger as well as increasing the heat exchange through the surface of the exchanger. Results in the article indicated that the use of hybrid nano - structure coating is for inducing the feature of super - hydrophobicity for the surface that touches the fluid included within the heating transferring. Such feature can make an increase in the heating transferring factor and a decreasing in power losing produced via friction. This article indicated that the Zeta voltage analysis is to show the stability of the hybrid nanofluids used in the coating process. The enhanced technology depends upon the concept that exists in nature under the name "Lotus effect" to get super-hydrophobic surfaces. The rate of improvement in heat transfer using hybrid nanoparticles is 33% compared to that without coating condition.

AB  - Treated wastewater is constantly produced and relatively unaffected by climatic conditions, while Constructed Wetlands (CWs) are recognized as green technology and a cost-effective alternative to improve treated wastewater quality standards. This paper analyses how farmers consider (1) treated wastewater to face water scarcity risk and (2) CW as mechanisms to face agricultural water pollution in a climate change adaptation context. A survey about climate change perception and adaptation measures was answered by 177 farmers from two irrigation communities near El Hondo coastal wetland and the Santa Pola saltmarshes, both perceived as natural-constructed systems in Alicante, southern Spain. Results highlighted how, even with poor-quality standards, treated wastewater is considered a non-riskier measure and more reliable option when addressing climate change impacts. Overall, physical water harvesting (such as CWs) is the favorite choice when investing in water technologies, being perceived as the best option for users of treated wastewater and those concerned about water quality standards. Consequently, CWs were recognized as mechanisms to increase water supply and reduce water pollution. Policy-makers and water managers can use these learnings from farmers' experience to identify the main barriers and benefits of using treated wastewater and CWs to address water scarcity and water pollution risks.

AB  - The article presents issues related to the aging behavior of oil-paper insulations in transformers using different oil- and ester-based insulating fluids. Despite numerous conducted studies on the subject of oil-paper aging, the use of new insulating fluids is creating open questions. In addition, new liquids such as synthetic and natural esters, as well as oil of the newest generation, are being used. Furthermore, there is still little research on the formation of aging markers with this form of the dielectric. For this reason, in this contribution, oil-paper insulations with mineral oil-based insulating fluids, natural and synthetic esters, as well as oil from natural gas, are aged thermally accelerated at 130 degrees C over a duration of 15 weeks, by considering two cases of free-breathing and hermetically sealed transformers. Therefore, various aging markers are investigated to allow a condition assessment. The results show that differences exist between the fluids and design of the transformer, as in the aging rate of the paper and the formation of aging markers in the insulating liquid such as acids. These findings can be used to improve asset management strategies by a more precise determination of the aging state depending on the transformer type as well as the type of insulating fluid.

AB  - Fungi are known to exert a significant influence over soil organic matter (SOM) turnover, however understanding of the effects of fungal community structure on SOM dynamics and its consequences for ecosystem fertility is fragmentary.
   Here we studied soil fungal guilds and SOM decomposition processes along a fertility gradient in a temperate mountain beech forest. High-throughput sequencing was used to investigate fungal communities. Carbon and nitrogen stocks, enzymatic activity and microbial respiration were measured.
   While ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance was not related to fertility, saprotrophic ascomycetes showed higher relative abundances under more fertile conditions. The activity of oxidising enzymes and respiration rates in mineral soil were related positively to fertility and saprotrophic fungi. In addition, organic layer carbon and nitrogen stocks were lower on the more fertile plots, although tree biomass and litter input were higher. Together, the results indicated a faster SOM turnover at the fertile end of the gradient.
   We suggest that there is a positive feedback mechanism between SOM turnover and fertility that is mediated by soil fungi to a significant extent. By underlining the importance of fungi for soil fertility and plant growth, these findings furthermore emphasise the dependency of carbon cycling on fungal communities below ground.

AB  - Marine microplastic has become an important environmental issue of global concern due to its wide distribution and harmful impacts. However, there is still insufficient information on the toxicity mechanism of microplastics to marine organisms. In this study, we developed and applied a high-coverage quantitative metabolomics technique to investigate the toxicity mechanisms of the polystyrene microspheres (micro-PS) on marine mussels (Mytilus coruscus). A total of 3599 metabolites were quantified, including 163 positively identified metabolites, 318 high-confident putatively identified metabolites, and 2602 mass-matched metabolites from the hemolymph of mussels. Metabolomics analysis indicated that micro-PS disrupted the amino acid metabolism, particularly phenylalanine metabolism, which may lead to oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Micro-PS at environmentally relevant concentrations induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in mussels. After 7 days of recovery, along with the significant clearance of micro-PS by mussels, both metabolite levels and biochemical indicators generally returned to the same level as the control group. Overall, the results showed that microplastics at environmentally-relevant concentrations can cause toxic effects on mussels but these influences are reversible. We envisage the usages of high-coverage metabolomics for investigating the toxicity of various types of microplastics under many different conditions, including those relevant to the marine environment.

AB  - Aquaculture conducted in sea cages typically releases organic and inorganic wastes which deposit at the seafloor and may influence resident benthic communities. In regions with predominantly hard bottom substrates such as Newfoundland, Canada, the monitoring of aquaculture waste buildup at the seafloor is conducted through the use of visual indicators such as bacterial mats. To ascertain the validity of bacterial mats as indicators of aquaculture deposits, we examine relationships between substrate elemental and organic matter concentrations, bacterial community composition and the presence or absence of white bacterial mats. Substrates with bacterial communities previously defined as belonging to high impact and recently disturbed bacterial clusters showed higher concentrations of abiotic markers of aquaculture compared to substrates with low impact or intermediate impact bacterial communities. Bacterial mat presence was associated with the four pre-defined bacterial community clusters, while mat absence was mainly observed in substrates with bacterial communities indicative of low impact. Although visual indicators are less sensitive ecological indicators of benthic aquaculture effects than the determination of the identity of bacterial communities, bacterial mat presence remains a valid indicator of aquaculture-linked deposits atop hard-bottom dominated substrates. However, the absence of bacterial mats may be indicative of conditions ranging from no aquaculture impacts to low levels of deposition, and should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - This study was conducted on two native fish species namely Mystus vittatus and Mystus tengara inhabiting challenging environment of Yamuna River. The heavy metals concentrations in the river water were found to be as follows: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cr > Cd, all above the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The high metal pollution index in gill, liver, and kidney of M. vittatus was recorded compared to M. tengara. The pathology caused by the accumulation of heavy metals resulted significantly (p < 0.05) higher enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) in M. tengara as compared to M. vittatus. However, albumin: globulin ratio was found to be below 0.8 in both fishes. Higher total leukocyte (TLC) (48.5 x 10(3)/mm(3)), lymphocytes (40%), respiratory burst activity (1.9), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity (13.11 U/L) in M. vittatus reflect high immune response. In addition, chromosomal breakage study showed significantly (p < 0.05) low micronuclei frequency, lobed nuclei, and kidney-shaped nuclei (KSN) in M. vittatus. These results indicate that under the same challenging conditions M. vittatus have more capability of resistance and its continuous survival points towards its suitability to serve as a bioindicator than M. tengara.

AB  - We investigated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) activity and individual growth rate (IGR) as individual-based in situ indicators of growth in adult krill, Euphausia pacifica. AARS enzymes catalyze the first step in protein synthesis while the IGR method is based on changes in body length during molting. Growth rates of field-collected krill were measured via the IGR method and individuals were subsequently preserved for AARS analysis to yield paired measurements. Our results show that conditions during the IGR incubation period influenced AARS activity in these individuals precluding a direct comparison but revealing the different timescales across which these two measures integrate. Importantly, they show that AARS activity provides a snap-shot image of an organism's metabolism, while IGR of krill is thought to integrate their environmental experience over several days. Each method would require repeated measurements to estimate population growth rates integrated over seasonal or generational time scales. As part of this project, we investigated how specific the AARS assay is to protein synthesis by testing a modified protocol that includes an additional blank and found evidence that the current assay may be measuring other cellular processes in addition to its intended signal. Our results suggest that a new NADH Blank might be optimized to improve the specificity of the assay.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in developing natural methods to replace the current chemicals used for maintaining postharvest quality of citrus fruits. The essential oil antifungal activity of mint (MEO), basil (BEO), and lavender (LEO) acting as the vapor-phases was tested against Penicillium digitatum. The minimum doses with fungistatic and fungicidal effect, in vitro, acting as the vapor-phases, were set up. The minimum fungicidal dose was 300 mu L for BEO and 350 mu L LEO, while for MEO only minimal dose with fungistatic effect was reached. The IC50 values were calculated and used (v/v) for testing preservation of lemon fruits, in close space enriched in vapor oil. For this purpose, the following two independent in vivo experiments were carried out: experiment 1, inoculated lemons with P. digitatum stored without chemical treatments 7 days, at 22 +/- 2 degrees C, at two concentrations (C1-IC50 equivalent; C2-half of C1); and experiment 2, the non-inoculated lemons kept under the same conditions and concentrations of EO vapor served to evaluate the lemon quality properties. The results showed that antifungal protective effect was provided in the order of LEO-C1 > BEO-C1 > MEO-C1 > BEO-C2 > MEO-C2 > LEO-C2. The quality indicators like weight loss, pH, and firmness were not negatively influenced.

AB  - The current study examines changes in daily life experiences following mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in a sample of 38 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and residual symptoms following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants were randomized to either an MBCT group (n = 17), or to a psychoeducational group (OCD-EP; n = 21) as an active control condition. Both groups underwent ecological momentary assessment (EMA) six times a day for a period of six consecutive days pre- and posttreatment. Contrary to hypotheses, MBCT participation did not, when compared to OCD-EP, result in significant changes of positive affect, negative affect, acceptance of momentary emotions, or distress associated with obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. In fact, insight into the unreasonableness of OC symptoms improved significantly more in the OCD-EP group compared to MBCT. However, in the MBCT group, the presence of momentary OC symptoms at post assessment predicted increased insight, which indicates an improved ability to detach from OC symptoms in the moments in which they occur. All in all, however, results do not indicate favorable changes in everyday life experiences of OCD patients following MBCT. Owing to the modest sample size, results must be considered preliminary. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - In order to evaluate the tolerance to water deficit stress of 47 different ecotypes of Iranian cannabis (Cannabis saliva L.), a split plot experiment based on a randomized complete block design with two replications was conducted at the Research Station of the University of Tehran in 2015. Ecotypes were considered as the minor factor and water deficit stress was considered as the major factor. There were included 100% (as the control) and 50% evapotranspiration of Etc. Shrubs were harvested after the end of the flowering period of male and female plants. Dry weight was measured. The water use efficiency, yield stability index, stress tolerance index, geometric mean productivity, stress susceptibility index, tolerance index, and mean productivity indices were obtained through dry matter yield under stress and normal conditions. The results showed that, in general, water deficit stress reduced dry matter production. A high correlation was observed between dry matter yield and drought tolerance indices. Geometric mean productivity, stress tolerance index, and mean productivity indices, which had high positive correlations with yield of genotype in stress environments and yield of genotype in nonstress environments, were good indicators of isolating and distinguishing ecotypes in terms of their reaction to water deficit. Qzv-02, Sav-01, Ney-01, Rash-01, and Bsh-01 ecotypes had the highest water use efficiency and the highest yield under water deficit stress.

AB  - The extent to which people are aware of their emotional experiences, label them and communicate them to the outside world are considered to impact emotional experience itself and potentially people's depressive symptom levels. All of these aspects are important elements of one of the most common methods to study and measure emotions in the context of daily life, the so-called experience sampling method (ESM). A straightforward question that arises when using this method is whether participating in ESM may bring about changes in the momentary emotional self-reports of the people engaging in it, thereby effectively influencing that what it intends to measure; emotional experience over time, and whether this would relate to average levels of depressive symptoms. To examine these questions, we conducted a 7-day ESM study in which 90 participants were randomly assigned to repeatedly report either positive emotions only, negative emotions only or non-emotional internal states only, course using smartphones. Participants also completed pre-, post- and follow-up measurements of levels of depressive symptoms. Results showed no significant impact on self-reported momentary emotions, respective to their condition, over time nor on average levels of depressive symptoms across groups. These findings suggest that the repeated assessment of emotions in daily life, over the course of seven days, does not impact their emotional experience over time nor levels of depressive symptoms.

AB  - Lymnaea stagnalis, also referred to as great or common pond snail, is an abundant and widespread invertebrate species colonizing temperate limnic systems. Given the species importance, studies involving L. stagnalis have the potential to produce scientifically relevant information, leading to a better understanding of the damage caused by aquatic contamination, as well as the modes of action of toxicants. Lymnaea stagnalis individuals are easily maintained in laboratory conditions, with a lifespan of about two years. The snails are hermaphrodites and sexual maturity occurs about three months after egg laying. Importantly, they can produce a high number of offspring all year round and are considered well suited for use in investigations targeting the identification of developmental and reproductive impairments. The primary aims of this review were two-fold: i) to provide an updated and insightful compilation of established toxicological measures determined in both chronic and acute toxicity assays, as useful tool to the design and development of future research; and ii) to provide a state of the art related to direct toxicant exposure and its potentially negative effects on this species. Relevant and informative studieswere analysed and discussed. Knowledge gaps in need to be addressed in the near futurewere further identified. (C) 2019 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The soil properties reported in areas with different management provide useful information about the systems' operation, state of conservation and resilience. In this way, this study evaluated physical properties and organic matter dynamics of soil under different plant covers in seven areas consisting of: five areas under ecological restoration (REC1 to REC5), an areas with native vegetation (MATA) and a sugarcane crop area (SC), all located in State of Mato Grosso do Sul, a transition area between the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. Samples were taken at the 0-10 and 10-20 cm layers and were analyzed for soil density (Ds), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), total porosity (PT), weighted mean diameter (DMP), aggregate stability index (IEA), and the particle sizes of organic matter. There were no differences in DMP between the areas, however, sugarcane crop area and areas under ecological restoration (REC 1, 3 and 4) had high values of density and microporosity and low contents of the fractions of organic matter, which can promote a greater restriction to the root development of plants. Among the areas under restoration, REC1 and REC5 presented physical conditions with higher similarity to the native vegetation area. Changes in the physical soil properties and parameters such as Total organic carbon (COT), confirmed that the restoration practices applied improved the soil quality.

AB  - A sustainable city is an elusive goal without a sustainable transport network. A sustainable urban transport system balances social, economic, and environmental goals through inclusive decision-making. Public acceptability of sustainable transport measures is a challenge for developing cities such as Dhaka, where mobility to all income groups of the society needs to be ensured without hampering environmental balance and road safety condition. This paper sets out a comprehensive analysis of how people perceive different attributes of sustainability of the existing transport operation in Dhaka. Considering the unavailability of a standardized set of indicators to evaluate transport sustainability performance in Dhaka, this research identified a set of 14 subjective indicators based on an extensive literature survey and local expert opinion. The study explored a high level of user displeasure over the transport sustainability performance in the city. Travel time, women accessibility, and safety were identified as the top priority indicators in terms of user disgruntlement where cost issue generated fewer complaints. Variation of perception of different social groups have been explored to find that young, educated, and high-income respondents are the most concerned about sustainability issues. The research concluded discussing the probable acceptability or risk of a few transport policies based on the findings. The study developed a framework for investigating transport sustainability performance with subjective indicators that may assist policy makers in promoting inclusive decisions through the efficient use of resources.

AB  - Complex analysis of thermal and gaseous states of chosen coal dumps performed by the authors made it possible to initially evaluate risk of spontaneous combustion of these objects and their classification based on indicators of a certain risk group. Thanks to the observation of coal dumps using a thermovisual camera, non-contact visualization of temperature distribution of the coal dump was obtained in the form of colored thermograms, which led to identifying areas of higher thermal activity. Use of a thermovisual camera is an example of adaptation of modern technology for research purposes. Properly planned measurement, swift development, and comparison of results gives complex information about object structure and thermal reactions on its surface. Analysis of thermal anomalies found on coal dumps allows us to draw conclusions about the causes of these events and repeating characteristics of environmental physicochemical condition variability accompanying such events.
   The process of endogenic fire formation is a complex mechanism that is not yet fully understood. Doubts were dispelled in the matter of main spontaneous combustion, which is the oxidation process of coal and which is the main burning by-product material of a mining operation. However, the reason for the activation process of self-heating and leading coal substance to critical temperature (60-80 degrees C) is not fully understood. According to this, the author has reviewed knowledge related to experiences with spontaneous combustion of coal dumps.

AB  - The Climate Vulnerability Index for Water (CVIW) was developed and applied to assess the climate related water vulnerability of households in mountainous region. The CVIW provides a realistic approach to recognize social and natural factors contributing to climate change water vulnerability at the household level. CVIW comprises of three components-exposure (Exp.), sensitivity (Sen.) and adaptive capacity (Adap.Cap.)-and 14 sub-components: four for Exp., five for Sen. and five for Adap.Cap. An indicator-based approach was used to assess the components of the index whereas a composite-index approach to estimate the index value. The CVIW was then applied for mountainous households in Uttrakhand, India. The study area was classified under rural and urban areas. Random sampling was adopted to select the households. The CVIW value in urban areas was found to be higher (0.767) than in rural areas (0.686) suggesting less water vulnerability of urban households. This comparatively higher water vulnerability of rural, forest-dependent, households is attributed to the heightened sensitivity and exposure of the rural region in comparison to the urban region. The major contributor to water vulnerability of rural households is the low standard of health facilities, the existing water problems and agricultural issues. Along with remoteness, the edaphic factors of mountainous region coupled with infrastructural issues are responsible for the present condition, all of which are addressable if future programs and policies include and implement regulations to remedy attributive factors.

AB  - Strawberry (Fragaria xananassa) is a perennial plant with a compressed woody crown that responds to the environment in a similar way as other temperate fruit crops. Nutrient management practices are also similar, with a few exceptions. Levels of preplant amendments are determined based on soil test results, and are used to increase nutrient availability and modify pH as needed. Once plants are established, soil tests, coupled with foliar tissue analysis and observations of plant growth, are the best indicators of plant nutrient status and limitations. Drip irrigation is more efficient than granular applications for supplying soluble nutrients such as nitrogen (N). While most temperate fruit crops respond well to N in spring when growth resumes after winter, applications of spring N in strawberry can cause excessive vegetative growth, reduce fruit quality, and have only a marginal impact on yield. N is most efficiently taken up by plants when conditions favor root growth, and N applied in summer or fall is more effective at increasing yield the following spring, assuming that the carbohydrate status of the plant is good. However, if carbohydrate status is poor, supplemental N late in the season can reduce yield by requiring additional carbon (C) for N uptake. Many questions remain to better understand how to manage nutrients optimally in perennial strawberry.

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical variable and an ecosystem condition indicator that is measured from multiple methods. In this study, LAI was measured by a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and Li-Cor LAI-2200 plant canopy analyzer for understanding differences. A total of six different methods that consider leaf clumping, leaf-wood separation, and orthographic and stereographic projection were compared. A reasonable agreement among all methods for LAI estimates was observed (i.e., correlations r > 0.50). The Bayesian linear regression (BLR) approach was used to scale up the six different LAI estimates and to produce continuous field surfaces for the Oak Openings Region in northwest Ohio using Landsat TM-derived spectral vegetation indices (weighted difference vegetation index [WDVI], difference vegetation index [DVI], normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], soil-adjusted vegetation index [SAVI], and perpendicular vegetation index 3 [PVI3]). The BLR approach provides details about the parameter uncertainties that may arise from foliage and wooden biomass and can be used for model comparisons. In this study, the TLS estimates of foliage derived by orthographic projection had the lowest residual scatter and overall model uncertainty. The deviation departure from the mean BLR estimates revealed that sparse and open areas were associated with the highest error and spatial uncertainties.

AB  - This article reviews the occurrence of HABs in seawater, their effects on the operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants, the indicators for quantifying/predicting these effects, and the pretreatment strategies for mitigating operational issues during algal blooms. The potential issues in SWRO plants during HABs are particulate/organic fouling of pretreatment systems and biological fouling of RO membranes, mainly due to accumulation of algal organic matter (AOM). The presence of NAB toxins in desalinated water is also a potential concern but only at very low concentrations. Monitoring algal cell density, AOM concentrations and membrane fouling indices is a promising approach to assess the quality of SWRO feedwater and performance of the pretreatment system. When geological condition is favourable, subsurface intake can be a robust pretreatment for SWRO during HABs. Existing SWRO plants with open intake and are fitted with granular media filtration can improve performance in terms of capacity and product water quality, if preceded by dissolved air flotation or sedimentation. However, the application of advanced pretreatment using ultrafiltration membrane with in-line coagulation is often a better option as it is capable of maintaining stable operation and better RO feed water quality during algal bloom periods with significantly lower chemical consumption.

AB  - Physiological mechanisms underlying migration remain poorly understood, but recent attention has focused on the role of the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone (CORT) as a key endocrine regulator of migration. The migration-modulation hypothesis (MMH) proposes that baseline plasma CORT levels are elevated in migratory birds to facilitate hyperphagia and lipogenesis and that further elevation of CORT in response to acute stress is suppressed. Consequently, CORT may be a poor indicator of individual condition or environmental variation in migratory birds. We tested the MMH by measuring baseline and stress-induced CORT in common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) during fall migration over 2 consecutive years in the Revelstoke Reach drawdown zone, a migratory stopover site affected by local hydroelectric operations. Birds had low baseline CORT at initial capture (<5 ng/mL) and then showed a robust stress response, with CORT increasing to ca. 50 ng/mL within 10-20 min. Our data therefore do not support the MMH. Baseline CORT did not vary with body mass, time of capture, Julian day, or year, suggesting that variable flooding regimes did not affect baseline CORT. Individual variation in the rate of increase in CORT was correlated with Julian day, being higher later in the migration period. Our data suggest that plasma CORT can be a useful metric in migration studies.

AB  - Simultaneous electrophysiological and fluorescent imaging recording methods were used to study the role of changes of membrane potential or current in regulating the intracellular calcium concentration. Changing environmental conditions, such as the light-dark cycle, can modify neuronal and neural network activity and the expression of a family of circadian clock genes within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the location of the master circadian clock in the mammalian brain. Excitatory synaptic transmission leads to an increase in the postsynaptic Ca2+ concentration that is believed to activate the signaling pathways that shifts the rhythmic expression of circadian clock genes. Hypothalamic slices containing the SCN were patch clamped using microelectrodes filled with an internal solution containing the calcium indicator bis-fura-2. After a seal was formed between the microelectrode and the SCN neuronal membrane, the membrane was ruptured using gentle suction and the calcium probe diffused into the neuron filling both the soma and dendrites. Quantitative ratiometric measurements of the intracellular calcium concentration were recorded simultaneously with membrane potential or current. Using these methods it is possible to study the role of changes of the intracellular calcium concentration produced by synaptic activity and action potential firing of individual neurons. In this presentation we demonstrate the methods to simultaneously record electrophysiological activity along with intracellular calcium from individual SCN neurons maintained in brain slices.

AB  - Background. Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a chronic condition characterized by an exaggerated response to toxicants. We ascertained the prevalence of allergy to metals and toxicological aspects in MCS patients. Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of 41 patients with MCS. We performed patch testing (n = 21) for dental series and did lymphocyte transformation test (n = 18) for metals. We measured mercury in samples of blood (n = 19), urine (n = 19), saliva (n = 20), and scalp hair (n = 17) to investigate the association between mercury levels and cases of MCS. Results. The prevalence of metal immune hypersensitivity in a subset of 26 patients was 92.3 percent. Elevations of mercury occurred in 81.2 percent (26 of 32). The mean (+/- SD) in blood concentrations of mercury was 7.6 +/- 13.6 mu g/L; mean in urine was 1.9 +/- 2.5 mu g/L; mean in scalp hair was 2.2 +/- 2.5 mu g/g; mean in saliva was 38.1 +/- 52.1 mu g/L. Subgroup analyses showed that elevation of mercury levels in biological matrices were associated with mercury amalgams in patients with MCS (22 patients), compared with controls (8 patients) (odds ratio 11 : 95 percent confidence interval 1.5 to 81.6; P = 0.023). Conclusions. Our data show an increased prevalence of metal allergy and elevation of mercury levels in bioindicators among patients with MCS.

AB  - Community dynamics of microalgae in natural biofilms grown on 10 x 3 cm glass slides were studied in three inland water systems in Central Ontario, Canada. The periphyton communities were analyzed for species composition, diversity, density and biofilm thickness. The usefulness of periphyton community dynamics and species diversity in water quality monitoring was tested. The density of microalgae varied from 2.4 x 10(7)/cm(2) (Lake Couchiching) to 18 x 10(7)/cm(2) (Lake Simcoe) with highest species diversity at Lake Couchiching. Lake Simcoe with its moderately high phosphorus and low organic carbon showed the highest density of microalgae while Lake Couchiching with lowest total phosphorus and highest organic carbon showed the lowest density of microalgae in biofilms. The results of analysis of variance showed significant variation in the number of genera, density, biofilm thickness and diversity of microalgae in the three sampling locations. The Mill Creek site with minimum anthropogenic disturbance, minimum light availability, lower water temperature and slow but steady flowing conditions recorded the lowest species diversity and number of genera. The dominant genera of diatoms were significantly different in the three sampling locations. This study thus showed the usefulness of periphyton community dynamics in the assessment of water quality in the inland water systems. (C) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB  - Different plant organs (leaves, flowers, sterns or roots) from naturally occurring wild plants and trees, and cultivated plants (vegetables and fruits) were evaluated as possible bioindicators of heavy-metal pollution in the Republic of Serbia. Concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd were determined in plant parts collected from areas with different degrees of metal pollution (Kosovska Mitrovica - industrial area and Leposavic - control area). Accumulation and distribution of heavy metals in the plant depend on the plant species, the levels of the metals in the soil and air, the element species and bioavailiability, pH, cation exchange capacity, climacteric condition, vegetation period and multiple other factors. The highest amounts of heavy metals were found in the root of the sensitive Plontago major (Pb 660, Zn 2300 and Cd 33.25 mu g g(-1) d.w.) and less in the resistant Rumex acetosella. In over ground organs the highest amounts of heavy metals were found in the leaves (283 mu g g(-1) d.w. Pb) and then in the fruits (3,5-136 mu g g(-1)) and vegetables (1.5-13 mu g g(-1)). In this study, the bark of Robimia pseudoacacia was a better bioindicator of heavy-metal pollution than other plant parts. Summarizing the results, it can be concluded that R. pseudoacacia, P major and R. acetosella were better metal accumulators and fruits and vegetables were metal avoiders.

AB  - Nowadays the potential of photo-Fenton process for decontamination of biologically persistent wastewater is widely recognized. In this process, hydrogen peroxide consumption could be considered as one of the factors that considerably affects costs. This highlights that an automatically hydrogen peroxide dosing system to keep the concentration optimized throughout the process would be a valuable tool for industrial wastewater remediation plants. Automatic H2O2 dosing during photo-Fenton would require a precise online measuring device. Today, several expensive and unreliable in complicated wastewater hydrogen peroxide probes are commercially available. This study focuses on considering dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) as a reaction stage indicator related to H2O2 concentration and consumption during photo-Fenton wastewater treatment. First, specific experiments designed to find out the DO-H2O2 related behavior during photo-Fenton at different possible operating conditions were carried out with manual addition of H2O2. Afterwards, a following set of experiments was performed with automatic H2O2 dosing according to DO concentration maintaining this parameter between desirable set points during the photo-Fenton reaction. The obtained results demonstrated the potential for making use of the DO profile for monitoring photo-Fenton, automatically dosing H2O2 and determining the end point of the treatment. The active participation of oxygen in the first stages of the process by Dorfman-mechanism was confirmed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, we have analyzed the changes in the protein expression profile elicited by chromium (Cr) exposure in the freshwater green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, a well known bio-indicator of water pollution. We tested two experimental conditions, namely 0.2 and 1 ppm of potassium dichromate; this concentration range includes the environmentally-relevant concentrations. Results show that neither concentration of potassium dichromate tested inhibited algal growth. However, the proteomic approach allowed the identification of relevant modifications in protein expression. In fact, among 800 protein spots detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis, 16 Cr-regulated proteins, including predicted and novel ones, were identified using tandem mass spectromic protein analysis.
   The results demonstrate a Cr-specific action in altering several photosynthetic proteins, such as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), RuBisCO activase, Light Harvesting Chla/b protein complex, and stress related Chla/b binding protein1. Although Cr toxicity with respect to photosynthesis has been already documented, here we have identified, for the first time, the target proteins of this toxicity. Cr also induced a modulation of some proteins involved in the metabolism of the amino acids glutamine, arginine and methionine. These data are supported by changes in cellular polyamine (PA) accumulation. Present findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying Cr toxicity in P. subcapitata.

AB  - Annual macroinvertebrate sampling was performed from 1994 to 2005 in the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed in northern Idaho to examine the relationship between contemporary timber harvest practices and the structure and diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Four years of calibration, 4 years of postroad, and 4 years of postharvest (roads + harvest) data were used to analyze treatment effects. Metrics used to assess chan-e included functional feeding group composition, organism densities, taxa richness indices, species diversity, and sediment tolerance indices. These assessments included changes to three macroinvertebrate taxa commonly used as bioindicators of stream habitat quality: Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddis flies) (EPT). In relation to pretreatment conditions, there were generally no major changes in functional feeding group composition or species diversity. Increases were observed in overall abundance and EPT abundance, but they largely can be explained by natural population variability. These results suggest that little or no change in macroinvertebrate communities resulted from road construction and timber harvest activities in the watershed. Substantial interannual variability was also observed, suggesting that infrequent biomonitoring may not provide adequate information to assess subtle disturbance effects in watersheds but can be an effective part of a comprehensive watershed monitoring program when coupled with other biotic and abiotic metrics.

AB  - The humaneness of various coyote (Canis latrans) capture methods (especially foothold traps) is an issue that has made trapping controversial. In Massachusetts the use of padded foothold traps and snares became illegal in 1996. In response, we tested metal box traps as an alternative capture technique for eastern coyotes in a suburban environment within Barnstable County, Cape Cod, Massachusetts between March 1998-May 2000 and February 2001-April 2002. Box traps were in the field for 7,006 trap days and were set for 1,447 trap days. Trapping effort was 4,458 trap visits. Traps were sprung 447 times, and 387 animals of 12 species were captured. Twenty-two individual coyotes (12 adults, 5 subadults, and 5 pups) were captured 29 times; 3 adults were captured twice and 2 adults 3 times. Coyotes were captured during 11 of 12 months. Few injuries were sustained to coyotes captured in box traps, and no captured animals showed indicators of poor welfare; 1 coyote had minor limb damage, 2 had minor and 2 had moderate tooth damage, and no injuries to the body were documented. Box traps were undesirable to use for capturing coyotes because of trap expense, time involved in baiting and conditioning coyotes to traps, the high rate of nontarget captures, and the fact that it was difficult to capture >1 adult in a social group.

AB  - During the last few years there has been a continuous and important growth in water consumption and consequently a strong increase of the domestic and industrial wastewater potential sources of environmental problems. Reclamation of wastewater is thus becoming a major goal in several countries where there is water scarcity. Thus we tested an a lab scale a combination of sand filtration and UF producing a clear disinfected water which could be reused. A tubular inorganic membrane CARBOSEP with 50,000 Da MWCO was used for this study. At a cross flow velocity of 4 m/s the polarization phenomena were limited leading to a maximum value of about 100 1/h.m(2) for a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar. With an increase of the cross flow velocity up to 6-7 m/s, the relation between the filtrate flux and the transmembrane pressure becomes nearly linear: in these conditions, in a range of transmembrane pressure 0.5-2 bar, the filtrate flux is only 15% lower than the pure water flux, proving a very low level of fouling. The removal efficiency of organics and suspended solids (including bacteria) was very good: 1) low values of COD (12 mg/l) BOD (5 mg/l) and absence of indicators of fecal contamination are the main characteristics of the treated water; 2) it can be concluded from these tests that the combination sand filtration/UF is efficient and that a cut-off of 50 Kda is a good choice.

AB  - Mugineic acid (MA; (2S, 2'S, 3'S, 3 " S)-N-[3-carboxy-3-(3-carboxy-3-hydroxy-propylamino) -2-hydroxypropyl]-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid), a multidentate complexing agent, is exuded by the roots of graminaceous plants (e.g. barley) growing under Fe-deficient conditions. The nature of the interactions of MA with Fe (hydr)oxide minerals in soils is thus of considerable practical importance. To examine the availability of RIA in dissolving Fe (hydr)oxides, we investigated the amounts of Fe dissolved from 24 samples of Fe (hydr)oxides by 100 mu M MA (Fe-MA) and 200 mM NH4-oxalate (Fe-0).
   The Fe-0 values were much larger than the Fe-MA ones, though the crystallinity of the Fe (hydr)oxides was a significant factor. For Fe (hydr)oxides consisting of goethite, hematite, ferrihydrite, and their mixture, Fe-MA increased with the increase of Fe-0, indicating that Fe-MA would be correlated with Fee, that is the amount of short-range ordered Fe minerals including ferrihydrite. For goethite, hematite, magnetite, maghemite, and lepidocrocite with a high crystallinity, MA was relatively ineffective in dissolving Fe, although a part of crystalline magnetite, maghemite, and lepidocrocite could be dissolved by NH4-oxalate. For soils containing significant amounts of magnetite, maghemite, lepidocrocite, it is unlikely therefore that Fe-0 would be a useful indicator of plant-available Fe.

AB  - The current research presents fresh insights on empirically presenting the relationship between ownership structure and corporate sustainable performance of two emerging markets: Malaysia and Pakistan. Moreover, the moderating role of gender diversity is observed on the relationship between ownership structure and corporate sustainable performance. Dynamic estimator, named system generalized method of moments, is used for estimations that control for potential dynamic endogeneity, simultaneity, and reverse causality. Findings reveal that ownership concentration and state ownership are negatively related to economic, social, and environmental indicators of CSP both in Malaysia and Pakistan, whereas directors' ownership is positively associated with all sustainability indicators. Financial institution's ownership showed a positive significant impact on CSP in Malaysia, whereas an insignificant relationship is observed in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the moderating impact of women directors on the relationship between ownership structure and corporate sustainable performance reveals a significant impact in Malaysia and an insignificant impact in Pakistan. Generally, the findings of the study have practical implications for regulatory authorities, securities commissions, and policymakers of Malaysia and Pakistan. Moreover, there is a need to bring reforms into corporate governance structures in Pakistan, where weak economic conditions leave a frail impact of ownership structure on CSP and an insignificant moderating impact of board gender diversity.

AB  - Previous studies suggested that strong positive correlations between microbial taxa destabilized the microbial communities, because high synchrony between taxa caused different taxa responded in tandem to the changes of environmental conditions. In this study, we used nutrient concentrations (nitrogen and phosphorus) as indicators for anthropogenic activities, and explored the effects of anthropogenic activities on the stability of bacterial communities in a subtropical river, Xiyuan River. We also used co-occurrence networks to indicate the synchrony between bacterial taxa. The nutrient concentrations were higher in the midstream and downstream areas than in the upstream area of Xiyuan River. As a result, the average proportion and correlation coefficient of positive correlations were higher in the midstream and downstream networks than in the upstream networks. This indicates that frequent anthropogenic activities increased the synchrony between taxa in the midstream and downstream communities, and therefore destabilized the bacterial communities. To further explore the mechanisms, we found that the changes of community stabilities associated with the changes of bacterial functions. Anthropogenic activity tolerant bacteria (e.g., nutrient removal, aromatic degradation and pathogen bacteria) and their linked bacterial taxa formed large and strong positive modules in the midstream and downstream networks, and thus destabilized the communities. Based on the perspective of microbial correlations, our results provide a new insight in the mechanisms of how anthropogenic activities alter riverine microbial communities.

AB  - The water fraction derived from the hydrothermal liquefaction of a lignin-rich feedstock was subjected to aqueous phase reforming to produce hydrogen. Deactivation of the catalyst was observed, and it was ascribed to fouling phenomena caused by phenolic oligomers. Simple aromatics like guaiacol and phenol, as well as inorganics, were proved not to be the cause of the deactivation thanks to the use of a multi-component synthetic mixture. The influence of using activated carbon as a pretreatment was studied, leading to a strong improvement of the performance when it was carried out at high temperature. The extent of deactivation was assessed using aqueous phase reforming of glycolic acid as a model reaction test. The results were found to be correlated with the surface area of the catalyst. A thermal regeneration in inert conditions was evaluated as a mode of catalyst regeneration. While the textural properties were partially recovered, the performance of the catalyst only slightly improved. A spectroscopic analysis of the solids in the aqueous solution was carried out, highlighting the structural similarities between their nature and the lignin residue. The results obtained in this study helped to enlarge the knowledge on the aqueous phase reforming of real complex mixtures, looking at indicators of paramount importance for a possible industrial application such as the stability of the catalyst.

AB  - The African palm is the main source of vegetable oil worldwide, representing about 29.60% of the total oil and fat production around the world. The rapid expansion of this sector has faced several concerns related to environmental and social aspects that have driven the search for sustainable alternatives. In this work, the inherent safety analysis and sustainability evaluation for the crude palm oil production process was performed using the inherent safety index (ISI) method and the sustainable weighted return on investment metric (SWROIM), respectively. The process was designed for a processing capacity of 30 t/h of palm bunches and under North-Colombian conditions. Three technical indicators were considered to evaluate the process sustainability including exergy efficiency, potential environmental impacts output (PEI output), and the total inherent safety index (I-TI). The economic factor is directly considered since the SWROIM is an extension of the conventional return on investment (ROI). The resulting I-TI at 11 indicated an inherently safe process, and the highest risk was observed for the process equipment safety subindex. The SWROIM reached a higher value (53%) compared to the conventional ROI (49.39%), which suggests positive impacts on sustainability. The novelty of this work lies in detecting the inherent risks and providing a decision making criteria for this project through a complete evaluation that relates economic, energy, environmental, and safety criteria.

AB  - A new hybrid system coupled an absorption heat transformer to a photovoltaic module is put forward to capture the sunlight transmitted through photovoltaic module for heat upgrading. Taking account of multiple irreversible losses within the hybrid system, mathematic expressions for performance indicators of photovoltaic module, absorption heat transformer and hybrid system are formulated. Whether the proposed hybrid system is effective or not is evaluated. The maximum power output density and maximum energy efficiency of hybrid system are, respectively, enhanced by 99.05% and 99.01% compared with that of stand-alone photovoltaic module. Moreover, comprehensive sensitivity analyses are conducted to study how the hybrid system is affected by various designing parameters and operating conditions. Numerical calculation results indicate that the operating temperature of photovoltaic module, diode ideality factor, solar irradiance and various heat-transfer coefficients of absorption heat transformer have positive influence on the hybrid system performance. However, the environment temperature and heated space temperature have negative influence on the hybrid system performance. Furthermore, a practical case study has been conducted to show the performance limits of such a hybrid system. The present study may offer some new insights into the photovoltaic module performance improvement. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stereoselectivity, a distinctive characteristic of lipase (EC 3.1.1.3), refers to the ability to differentiate between enantiomeric positions (sn-1 and sn-3) in triacylglycerol (TAG). This property has been determined based on the time course of enantiomeric excess of diacylglycerol (DAG) considering several consecutive steps of lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of TAG; however, this concept is insufficient to represent the true nature of lipases which are capable of hydrolyzing the sn-2 position of TAG under the condition acyl migration occurs. Here, we suggest "integral stereoselectivity" to capture the preference of lipases for all ester groups of both TAG and DAG, as a novel index of the stereochemistry of lipase. To determine integral stereoselectivity, we established an analytical system based on the chromatographic resolution of dioleoylglycerol (DO) enantiomers and regioisomers. DO enantiomers were derivatized with 4-nitrophenyl isocyanate, and subsequently, resolved by chiral-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet. Regioisomers of monooleoylglycerol and DO were analyzed by HPLC with an evaporative light-scattering detector. Time-course analysis of three model lipases involved in the hydrolysis of trioleoylglycerol validated the analytical system designed to determine the integral stereoselectivity. As an accurate indicator of lipase stereochemistry reflecting all hydrolysis steps, integral stereoselectivity can expedite the development of lipases with unique stereochemistry from agricultural sources and their application to the food industry.

AB  - Cold treatment (vernalization) is required for winter crops such as rapeseed (Brassica napusL.). However, excessive exposure to low temperature (LT) in winter is also a stress for the semi-winter, early-flowering rapeseed varieties widely cultivated in China. Photosynthetic efficiency is one of the key determinants, and thus a good indicator for LT tolerance in plants. So far, the genetic basis underlying photosynthetic efficiency is poorly understood in rapeseed. Here the current study used Associative Transcriptomics to identify genetic loci controlling photosynthetic gas exchange parameters in a diversity panel comprising 123 accessions. A total of 201 significant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 147 Gene Expression Markers (GEMs) were detected, leading to the identification of 22 candidate genes. Of these, Cab026133.1, an ortholog of theArabidopsisgene AT2G29300.2 encoding a tropinone reductase (BnTR1), was further confirmed to be closely linked to transpiration rate. Ectopic expressingBnTR1inArabidopsisplants significantly increased the transpiration rate and enhanced LT tolerance under freezing conditions. Also, a much higher level of alkaloids content was observed in the transgenicArabidopsisplants, which could help protect against LT stress. Together, the current study showed that AT is an effective approach for dissecting LT tolerance trait in rapeseed and thatBnTR1is a good target gene for the genetic improvement of LT tolerance in plant.

AB  - Agricultural activity is largely influenced by climatic conditions. Rainfall is essential for crop production, and precipitation events also interfere with soil preparation, planting, application of pesticides and harvesting. Weather forecast models are tools to facilitate decision making for agricultural activities, hence high accuracy is desired. Farmers often criticize the accuracy of weather forecasts, which sometimes fail to predict precipitation events, leading to yield loss and environmental harm. In this study, precipitation forecasts of the Eta Model were evaluated for 28 of Brazil's most productive sugarcane areas, considering a grid of 15 x 15 km. Using a combination of different indicators of forecast success, observed and forecasted daily precipitation data were compared for consecutive days of all 10-day periods in a course of 6 years (2005-2010). Skill scores and performance diagrams based on the indicators were used to evaluate the goodness and robustness of the model forecasts. The Eta Model forecasts showed overall accuracies ranging between 55 and 71% for the Atlantic forest biomes (located North-West and South-East of Sao Paulo) and the Cerrado biomes (located in the Goias State and in the Center-North Sao Paulo State), respectively. The forecasts were most reliable for up to 4 days, showing an accuracy of 60%. Forecasts for periods of more than 4 days had an average accuracy of 40-50%. The probability of detecting rainfall correctly was the strongest characteristic of Eta Model, with more than 70% hits.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of diatoms collected from surface sediments in the Chanthaburi and Welu estuaries on the northern coast of the Gulf of Thailand. In total, 144 species are identified, representing 41 genera. Diatom abundance ranges from 645 to 24,979 valvesig, with an average of 7,215 valvesig. Diatoms primarily consist of common coastal species, warm water species and a few freshwater species. Additionally, Surirella tenera is identified as a unique freshwater species of the Welu River. Using cluster and redundancy analysis, we identified four diatom assemblages representing different environmental conditions. Diatom assemblages I and II are related to freshwater inputs from the Chanthaburi and Welu rivers. Assemblage III is closely related to nutrient concentrations and assemblage IV is representative of offshore waters from the Gulf of Thailand. The environmental factors controlling the distribution of diatoms are temperature, salinity, water depth and turbidity. The interior of the Welu Estuary was characterized by a brackish water environment strongly influenced by freshwater inputs to the south branch of the estuary and invasion of seawater into the north branch of the estuary. The Chanthaburi Estuary is a brackish water environment dominated by a single diatom assemblage. The main causes of differences in the distribution of diatoms between the Chanthaburi and Welu estuaries are runoff, estuary size, river width and nutrient concentrations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examined the effect of effluent water from an intensive fish farm on rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown under aerobic condition in Hungary. During the experiment four treatments were used: T-1- effluent water; T-2- effluent water supplemented with gypsum; T-3- effluent water diluted with surface water and supplemented with gypsum; T-C- control treatment. A number of quality parameters (TKW - thousand kernel weight, MQP - milling quality parameters, MC - mineral content) of the selected Hungarian rice variety (M 488) were studied. While, in the TKW test no statistically significant difference was found between the treatments, MQP test showed that there was a statistically significant difference between treatments in the percentage of whole polished (white) rice. The highest percentage was in T-C with 68.5%, T-1, T-2, and T-3 had 60%, 61.1% and 59.12%, respectively. The analytical analysis of MC highlighted, that the Ca and Na contents in rice seeds were not affected by the treatments, however, under T-3 a statistically significant decrease in the P, K and Mg contents of rice seeds was observed. Altogether, irrigation with fish farm water affects some quality parameters of the chosen rice variety in different ways, this effect can remain stable while reducing stress levels.

AB  - Large marine predators often aggregate seasonally in discrete locations to take advantage of optimal foraging conditions, leading to spatial and temporal variation in their exposure on other species. However, our understanding of the impacts this exposure may have on the behavior and physiology of prey is poor, especially in marine systems. Here, we evaluated the non-consumptive effects of potential exposure to large sharks (white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias (Linnaeus, 1758)) on the stress physiology of an economically important teleost, the striped bass (Morone saxatilis (Walbaum, 1792)), off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA. We sampled fish in habitats that varied significantly in shark exposure across 5 months and over 2 years, evaluating blood physiology stress indicators (i.e., cortisol, glucose, and lactate concentrations) and reflex impairment. None of the blood parameters were influenced by shark exposure, although we did observe subtle temperature and seasonal effects. One of the three reflex tests (the vertical orientation test) was negatively affected by shark exposure, although the mechanistic basis for this finding is unclear. This work supports the notion that predictable sources of predation pressure tend not to manifest in stress-related costs in free-ranging prey, which has implications for shaping our understanding of how large sharks influence ecosystems through non-consumptive effects.

AB  - Environmental issues are not peculiar in this country, especially issues involving river pollution. River pollution will affect food sources, economic activities, health conditions, as well as many other important aspects in human life. The objective of this study is to discuss the awareness of the community in dealing with the issue of Sungai Pinang pollution by using indicators of knowledge, effect, and action. This study uses quantitative methods through a questionnaire involving 100 community respondents who live in the Sungai Pinang area. Respondents involved were randomly selected in the data collection process. Data was analyzed to obtain frequency and percentage values. The findings show that the community's dominant source knowledge on Sungai Pinang pollution is based on their own observations, while their dominant knowledge of factor contributes to Sungai Pinang pollution is the result of garbage disposal activity. Whereas, the dominant effects of Sungai Pinang pollution are foul air and dirty environment. As for their dominant action against Sungai Pinang pollution is to ensure that the doors and windows of the house are always closed and the safety net is placed in the yard. This study has the potential in providing information and understanding to the community to deal with river pollution issues. In addition, it is hoped that this study will serve as an important reference to the authorities in formulating holistic strategies and interventions for human and environment well-being.

AB  - An analysis was carried out to understand how watersheds' potential for restoration was impacted by social indicators. This study employed the USEPA Recovery Potential Screening tool, a decision support system, to compare 51 watersheds in the state of Mississippi, USA, using ecological, stressor, and social indices, and the recovery potential integrated (RPI) index. An in-depth analysis was performed on four watersheds in the Delta region of Mississippi (Lake Washington, Harris Bayou, Steele Bayou, and Coldwater River), each impaired by sediments and nutrients. Sixteen social indicators were categorized into three subcategories: Socio-Economic, Organizational, and Informational.
   Watersheds with lower social indices had lower RPI scores. In the particular watersheds studied, the Socio-Economic subcategory was observed to be the most impactful to the overall recovery potential when compared to the other two social subcategories. As a sensitivity analysis, a "what if" simulation was performed to explore alternatives to upgrade a watershed's social index and, consequently, the relative recovery potential of the watershed to a target level. This analysis is useful for understanding how particular social indicators of a community impact the relative potential for recovering a watershed, beyond just the ecological and stressor conditions. It also sheds light on assessing which social indicators can be improved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper presents the risk management methodology, which uses geoinformation systems that include functions and instruments indispensable for the input, analysis and visualization of spatial information. A structure of the risk management system for the safe pipeline maintenance under geodynamic influences was formed. It is found that the insulation coating of the pipeline, as an indicator of the technical condition of the pipeline that shows the effect of land sliding processes on the pipeline, is damaged in the area, which is marked as landslide-prone, as evidenced by the results of examination of the adjacent rock mass by the NPEMFE method. So, the section between meters 15-50 of the surveyed pipeline can be defined as having a high degree of geodynamic risk (the risk of active sliding processes). It is established that a complex application of express-methods for the inspection of the pipeline and the adjacent rock mass allows obtaining the data to determine the actual level of geodynamic hazards on the route of the pipeline. A methodology approbated on Pasichna-Dolyna gas pipeline area, which is situated in a highly landslide-prone zone, was described. As evaluation, the express method of natural impulse electromagnetic field of the Earth (NPEMFE) registration was chosen. Measurement system RIDGID SR-60 from the surface has been applied with the purpose to conduct noncontact survey of pipeline insulation in the Pasichna-Dolyna area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We used 2 years of camera-trap surveys conducted by citizen scientists to compare native mammal and bird visits to dominant fruiting-tree species in low and high cattle-impact areas of rarely-flooded "cordilheira" forests in the Brazilian Pantanal. Monthly fruit censuses showed greater diversity of fruiting-tree species in low cattle impact areas. Citizen scientists documented 29 native mammal and bird species among 5639 photo records obtained at fruiting trees. Analyses of 3 sets of camera-trap samples comprising: (1) only Attalea phalerata palms, (2) all ten dominant fruiting-tree species, and (3) all except a species with a highly-valued fruit and an unusual distribution, showed that faunal composition in low cattle-impact areas was significantly different and more diverse compared to that in high cattle-impact areas. Long-term cattle-related alterations of forest vegetation and short-term fruit depletion and interference by cattle explained faunal differences. While 5 frugivores and 1 carnivore were consistent indicators of low cattle-impact conditions, the value of 2 other frugivores (Tayassu pecari and Crax fasciolata) as indicators of cattle impact varied depending on fruit-species nutritive value, timing, and distribution. Improved cattle management is needed to prevent additional loss of forest biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We selected 14 anthropogenic organic compounds representing major classes of potential contaminants for analysis to determine their occurrence in the South Saskatchewan River and its tributaries near irrigated farmland and the only urban center in southeast Alberta, Canada. Agriculture and urban runoff and discharges seem to have little impact on the quality of surface water based on samples taken above and below Medicine Hat/Redcliff in the South Saskatchewan River and local tributaries. Samples of river water, tributary water, and raw and treated wastewater taken over a period of 3 years allowed an estimation of the impact of trace organic compounds from urban and agricultural activities on water quality. Of the 14 compounds investigated, 10 were detected in concentrations above the detection limit in at least one surface water sample and 9 at concentrations above the detection limit in sewage samples. The wastewater treatment plant removed indicator compounds to varying degrees, and the volume of treated effluent discharge was <1% of the river, even during the lowest flow conditions, thereby minimizing potential impact. Discharge in the river and tributaries varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study, including 2 major flood events in the South Saskatchewan River. Potential health or environmental effects were difficult to evaluate from a regulatory perspective because few guidelines are available for reference.

AB  - Using phytolith analysis from a well-dated and high-resolution sediment sequence in the apex of northern Yangtze Delta, we investigate environmental changes, the rise and decline of rice exploitation and possible impacts of environment on rice exploitation during the early mid-Holocene. The phytolith sequence documents a relatively warm and dry interval during ca.9000 to 8200 cal yr BP, followed by climatic amelioration before 7200 cal yr BP. Phytolith evidence indicates that rice exploitation at the apex of northern Yangtze Delta began at 8200 cal yr BP, flourished by 7700 cal yr BP and ceased after 7400 cal yr BP. The first emergence of marine diatom species approximately 7300 cal yr BP likely indicates an accelerated sea-level rise. The apparent correlation of the initiation of rice exploitation with climatic amelioration during the early mid-Holocene suggests that climatic changes may have played an important role in facilitating rice exploitation. Both the ideal climatic conditions and stable sea level enabled flourishing rice exploitation during 8200 to 7400 cal yr BP. Although the climate remained warm and wet after 7400 cal yr BP, local sea-level rise possibly led to the termination of earlier rice exploitation at this site of the northern Yangtze Delta.

AB  - Numerical discretization schemes have a long history of incorporating the most important conservation properties of the continuous system in order to improve the prediction of the nonlinear flow. The question arises whether data assimilation algorithms should follow a similar approach. To address this issue, we explore the conservation properties during data assimilation using perfect model experiments with a 2D shallow-water model preserving important properties of the true nonlinear flow. The data assimilation scheme used here is the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter with varying observed variables, inflation, localization radius and thinning interval. It is found that, during the assimilation, the total energy of the analysis ensemble mean converges with time towards the nature run value. However, enstrophy, divergence and the energy spectra are strongly affected by the data assimilation settings. Having in mind that the conservation of both the kinetic energy and enstrophy by the momentum advection schemes in the case of non-divergent flow prevents a systematic and unrealistic energy cascade towards the high wave numbers, we test the effects on the prediction depending on the type of error in the initial condition. During the assimilation, we assess the downward nonlinear energy cascade through a scalar, domain-averaged noise measure. We show that the accumulated noise during assimilation and the error of analysis are good indicators of the quality of the prediction.

AB  - Coal and hydrocarbons have been exploited from the Carboniferous rocks of the Midland Valley for over 200 years. This work characterises organic matter from the Mississippian black shales of the Midland Valley from Wardie, Scotland. Biomarker analysis allowed the estimation of the degree of microbial transformation of organic matter, type of kerogen and thermal maturity during hydrocarbon generation. Parameters based on the biomarker indicators confirm a generally mixed type II/III kerogen. However, some samples contain mostly terrestrial organic matter, whilst others contain predominantly marine organic matter, which shows that the sedimentary environment varied greatly throughout the basin. The presence of gammacerane suggests water column stratification and anoxic conditions. Organic matter was much better protected from post-depositional alteration within the concretions, where higher TOC (total organic carbon) and TS (total sulphur) contents occur, than in the surrounding sediments. This can be induced by very early diagenetic formation of these concretions which protected organic matter from late diagenetic degradation. Estimated values of vitrinite reflectance (Rc, Rcs) show that the sedimentary rocks reached the catagenesis stage. Most samples exhibit maximum organic matter maturation temperatures of around c60-90 degrees C. However, stable isomers of phenyldibenzo[b,d]thiophene detected in some samples indicate that in some cases post-depositional hydrothermal activity affected maturation of organic matter increasing temperatures to as high as c174 degrees C.

AB  - This paper develops a model based on the agency theory to analyse road management systems that employ a mechanism of performance indicators to establish the payment for the contractor. The base assumption is the asymmetric information between a principal (Public Authorities) and an agent (contractor) and the risk aversion of the latter. It is assumed that the principal may only measure the agent's performance indirectly and by means of certain performance indicators that may be verified by the authorities. In this model it is assumed there is a relation between the efforts made by the agent and the performance level measured by the corresponding indicators, although there may be dispersions between both variables that give rise to a certain degree of randomness in the contract. An analysis of the optimal mechanism was made on the basis of this model and in accordance with a series of parameters that characterize the economic environment and the particular conditions of road infrastructure. As a result of the analysis, the incentive mechanism should include a fixed component and a payment according to the obtained performance level. The higher the risk aversion of the agent and the greater the marginal cost of public funds, the lower the impact of this performance-based payment. By way of conclusion, the system of performance indicators should be as broad as possible but should avoid those indicators that encompass greater randomness in their results.

AB  - Body height is an important factor in reconstructing health conditions and it serves as an indicator of socio-economic status. Researchers rely on ancient data to analyze evolutionary aspects of human health and its interrelation with environmental influences. This study presents body height estimates from all periods of ancient Egyptian history and compares the general population with the existing mummies of the members of royal families. A sample of 259 adult Egyptian mummies originating from various collections and published sources with body lengths (long bone measures or/and overall measurements, CT data) were analyzed, and royal mummies were scored with respect to the level of consanguinity. Male royals were taller than males in the general ancient Egyptian population, while female royals were shorter than females in the general population. The body height variation of the royals is significantly reduced when compared with a pool of non-royal mummies. This provides evidence for inbreeding resulting from consanguineous marriages. However, there appears to be no correlation between the level of inbreeding and individual body height. The random sample of general population does not show signs of inbreeding. Due to the present lack of larger, technically and ethically challenging genetic studies, the selected non-invasive approach of body height is the most reliable indicator of sibling marriages of pharaohs based on direct physical evidence.

AB  - An analysis of airplane accidents reveals that pilots sometimes purely fail to react to critical auditory alerts. This inability of an auditory stimulus to reach consciousness has been coined under the term of inattentional deafness. Recent data from literature tends to show that tasks involving high cognitive load consume most of the attentional capacities, leaving little or none remaining for processing any unexpected information. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence for a shared attentional capacity between vision and hearing. In this context, the abundant information in modern cockpits is likely to produce inattentional deafness. We investigated this hypothesis by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements with an ecological aviation task performed under contextual variation of the cognitive load (high or low), including an alarm detection task. Two different audio tones were played: standard tones and deviant tones. Participants were instructed to ignore standard tones and to report deviant tones using a response pad. More than 31% of the deviant tones were not detected in the high load condition. Analysis of the EEG measurements showed a drastic diminution of the auditory P300 amplitude concomitant with this behavioral effect, whereas the N100 component was not affected. We suggest that these behavioral and electrophysiological results provide new insights on explaining the trend of pilots' failure to react to critical auditory information. Relevant applications concern prevention of alarms omission, mental workload measurements and enhanced warning designs.

AB  - Disturbances are integral features of coral reefs, but since the 1970s they have degraded reefs throughout the world. While these events are well known, it is unclear how the perturbed communities will respond to further assaults. Here, we describe the effects of disturbances on reefs in St. John, US Virgin Islands, where coral cover has been < 4.5% for decades. In early 2010, seawater temperature exceeded values expected 95% of the time, but later in the year four storms brought 186 cm of rain that was 62% greater than the mean annual rainfall over 38 years. These storms increased terrigenous sedimentation and caused wave-induced re-suspension of benthic carbonate sediments. Rain-induced runoff was accentuated by overtopping of shoreline berms, and in the marine environment, a 10.5-fold elevation in the terrigenous accumulation and a 14.5-fold increase in re-suspended benthic carbonate sediments. The disturbances of 2010 were not clearly detectable by common indicators of reef condition, but were associated with 11-69% declines in coral recruitment, and increased densities of suspension-feeding polychaetes. Our results reveal the impacts of disturbances on coral reefs where low coral cover primes the community to display responses characterized by depressed coral recruitment and increased population sizes of polychaetes.

AB  - Objective: To investigate what impact individuals' position in a labour market core-periphery structure may have on their risk of disability pension (DP) in general and specifically on their risk of DP based on mental or musculoskeletal diagnoses.
   Methods: The study comprised 45 567 individuals who had been interviewed for the annual Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions (1992-2007). The medical DP diagnoses were obtained from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (1993-2011). The assumed predictors were studied in relation to DP by Cox's proportional hazards regression. The analyses were stratified on sex and age, controlling for social background and self-reported long-standing illness at baseline.
   Results: All three indicators underlying the categorisation of the core-periphery structure: employment income, work hours and unemployment, increased the risk of DP in all strata. The risk of DP tended to increase gradually the more peripheral the labour market position was. The risk estimates for DP in general and for DP based on mental diagnoses were particularly high among men aged 20-39 years.
   Conclusions: The core-periphery position of individuals, representing their labour market attachment, was found to be a predictor of future DP. The association was most evident among individuals below 40 years of age with regard to DP based on mental diagnoses. This highlights the need for preventative measures that increase the participation of young people in working life.

AB  - To date, few analyses of mutualistic networks have investigated successional or seasonal dynamics. Combining interaction data from multiple time points likely creates an inaccurate picture of the structure of networks (because these networks are aggregated across time), which may negatively influence their application in ecosystem assessments and conservation. Using a replicated bipartite mutualistic network of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal-plant associations, detected using large sample numbers of plants and AM fungi identified through molecular techniques, we test whether the properties of the network are temporally dynamic either between different successional stages or within the growing season. These questions have never been directly tested in the AM fungal-plant mutualism or the vast majority of other mutualisms. We demonstrate the following results: First, our examination of two different successional stages (young and old forest) demonstrated that succession increases the proportion of specialists within the community and decreases the number of interactions. Second, AM fungal-plant mutualism structure changed throughout the growing season as the number of links between partners increased. Third, we observed shifts in associations between AM fungal and plant species throughout the growing season, potentially reflecting changes in biotic and abiotic conditions. Thus, this analysis opens up two entirely new areas of research: 1) identifying what influences changes in plant-AM fungal associations in these networks, and 2) what aspects of temporal variation and succession are of general importance in structuring bipartite networks and plant-AM fungal communities.

AB  - Moderate-to-high levels of physical activity are established as preventive factors in metabolic syndrome development. However, there is variability in the phenotypic expression of metabolic syndrome under distinct physical activity conditions. In the present study we applied a Genotype X Environment interaction method to examine the presence of GxEE interaction in the phenotypic expression of metabolic syndrome. A total of 958 subjects, from 294 families of The Portuguese Healthy Family study, were included in the analysis. Total daily energy expenditure was assessed using a 3 day physical activity diary. Six metabolic syndrome related traits, including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, glucose, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides, were measured and adjusted for age and sex. GxEE examination was performed on SOLAR 4.3.1. All metabolic syndrome indicators were significantly heritable. The GxEE interaction model fitted the data better than the polygenic model ( p<0.001) for waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides. For waist circumference, glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides, the significant GxEE interaction was due to rejection of the variance homogeneity hypothesis. For waist circumference and glucose, GxEE was also significant by the rejection of the genetic correlation hypothesis. The results showed that metabolic syndrome traits expression is significantly influenced by the interaction established between total daily energy expenditure and genotypes. Physical activity may be considered an environmental variable that promotes metabolic differences between individuals that are distinctively active.

AB  - Biomass CCHP (combined cooling heating and power) systems based on biomass combustion have already demonstrated their benefits in some operating conditions. However, their environmental and energy performance might not always be better than that of conventional stand-alone generation systems. In order to assess the possible benefits, these plants are evaluated by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to provide some guidelines regarding their environmental feasibility. A thermodynamic model, which considers the integration of different sizes of cogeneration and cooling units, was developed to contribute to properly defining the life cycle inventory stage. Moreover, the model outputs were used to develop a primary energy savings ratio (PESR) analysis and compare its results with those of the LCA.
   The LCA results show that, whereas small plant cooling-to-heating ratios cause CCHP plants based on biomass combustion to be environmentally feasible (they imply environmental benefits compared to conventional average stand-alone generation), high plant cooling-to-heating ratios in fact cause them to be environmentally unfeasible. Results also allow us to state that the use of the PESR by itself might not be adequate to assess the steady-state performance of this type of plant because, in some circumstances, it might limit the plant's feasibility when environmental benefits could still be achieved.

AB  - The spatial distribution of eggs and larvae of three pelagic species, mackerel, horse mackerel and sardine, in the Bay of Biscay was studied in 1998, 2001 and 2004. The spatial distribution was clearly different between the years studied and corresponds quite precisely to different water circulation regimes. Mackerel and horse mackerel larvae are more affected by the prevailing currents than sardine, as their spawning grounds are located offshore, far from the shelf break where the current velocities are higher. Survival rates for mackerel and horse mackerel were higher in 2001, when the offshore larval transport was stronger. However, for sardine, the mortality rate hardly varied between years. The abundance of 25-day-old larvae, considered as an index of the survival rate, appears to be a good recruitment indicator, at least for 1998, 2001 and 2004. Our results did not support the hypothesis of Bakun (1996), which states that dispersion of early life stages towards open ocean waters should cause high larval mortality. At least under the conditions observed for the years studied, the retention of larvae offshore appears to have a positive effect on larval growth and/or survival.

AB  - One practice for reclaiming degraded agricultural soils under semiarid climate is to use organic amendment to improve the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil, therefore enhancing its fertility. A short-term field experiment was carried out to study the effects of different biosolid rates on selected soil properties and assess these as potential indicators of soil restoration. The organic waste was surface-applied once at three rates (30, 60, and 90 Mg ha(-1)) to an abandoned agricultural soil. Three years after the biosolid was applied several chemical and biological soil properties such as organic C (SOC), humified C fractions (THS-C), water soluble C (DOC), total nitrogen (N-k), basal respiration (CO2-E), and potential nitrogen mineralization (PMN) increased significantly in 60 Mg ha(-1) and in 90 Mg ha(-1) biosolid rates. The physical soil properties studied did not change with the biosolid treatments at least in this short-term experiment. The available heavy metals showed a slight increase in the biosolid treatments but the values obtained were below those considered phytotoxic. In spite of that the canopy cover was higher in the biosolid treatment plots than in the unamended soil which will contribute to soil restoration; the analysis of the biological properties did not show such a clear trend that they could be used as soil quality indicator under the condition of this study.

AB  - The pervasive use of ecological indices is increasingly requiring actions of harmonisation. Specifically, within the EU Water Framework Directive, an important effort in methods intercalibration is being done. However, a significant limitation in comparability assessment arises from the datasets used, which have different geographic origins. The purpose of our study was to perform an experimental intercalibration, where data were collected specifically on a set of common sites and following all the requirements of the methods being assessed. Three indices based on the marine angiosperm Posidonia oceanica, the POMI, the BiPo and the PoSte, were applied to sites in three different geographical areas of the western Mediterranean: Catalonia, Corsica and Southern Italy (Ischia), distant between hundreds and more than thousands of kilometers. Two indices, POMI and BiPo, showed not only a very good relationship with human pressures (measured on a common scale for all sites) but also a high comparability, in all aspects investigated. The differences found for the third one (PoSte) are hypothesised as being due to a different rationale used to define reference conditions, the different metrics used in the index, and in particular to a different definition of ecological status in relation to the time scale of the response to anthropogenic pressures. Our study demonstrates that indices with very different approaches can provide fully reliable and comparable results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop rotation and the maintenance of plant residues over the soil can increase soil water storage capacity. Root access to water and nutrients depends on soil physical characteristics that may be expressed in the Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR) concept. In this work, the effects of crop rotation and chiselling on the soil LLWR to a depth of 0.1 m and crop yields under no-till were studied on a tropical Alfisol in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, for 3 yr. Soybean and corn were grown in the summer in rotation with pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum, Linneu, cv. ADR 300), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, L., Moench), congo grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis, Germain et Evrard) and castor bean (Ricinus comunis, Linneu) during fall/winter and spring, under no-till or chiselling. The LLWR was determined right after the desiccation of the cover crops and before soybean planting. Soil physico-hydraulic conditions were improved in the uppermost soil layers by crop rotations under zero tillage, without initial chiselling, from the second year and on, resulting in soil quality similar to that obtained with chiselling. In seasons without severe water shortage, crop yields were not limited by soil compaction, however, in a drier season, the rotation with congo grass alone or intercropped with castor resulted in the greatest cover crop dry matter yield. Soybean yields did not respond to modifications in the LLWR.

AB  - Many multiple attribute decision analysis problems include both quantitative and qualitative attributes with various kinds of uncertainties such as ignorance, fuzziness, interval data, and interval belief degrees. An evidential reasoning (ER) approach developed in the 1990s and in recent years can be used to model these problems. In this paper, the ER approach is extended to group consensus (GC) situations for multiple attributive group decision analysis problems. In order to construct and check the GC, a compatibility measure between two belief structures is developed first. Considering two experts' utilities, the compatibility between their assessments is naturally constructed using the compatibility measure. Based on the compatibility between two experts' assessments, the GC at a specific level that may be the attribute level, the alternative level, or the global level, can be constructed and reached after the group analysis and discussion within specified times. Under the condition of GC, we conduct a study on the forming of group assessments for alternatives, the achievement of the aggregated utilities of assessment grades, and the properties and procedure of the extended ER approach. An engineering project management software selection problem is solved by the extended ER approach to demonstrate its detailed implementation process, and its validity and applicability.

AB  - As part of the National Park Service's Temporary Winter Use Plans Environmental Assessment, the University of Denver has been collecting in-use tailpipe emissions data from snowcoaches and snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park. During the winter of 2006, using a portable emissions monitoring system, tailpipe data were collected from 10 snowcoaches and 2 four-stroke snowmobiles. These vehicles were operated over a standard route within the park, and the snowcoaches all carried identical passenger loads. These snowcoaches were newer in age with more advanced fuel management technology than those studied earlier, and average emissions were lower as a result (120, 1.7, and 11 g/mi for carbon monoxide [CO], hydrocarbons [HC], and oxides of nitrogen [NO(x)]). Large emissions variability was still observed despite using a standardized route and equal passenger loading. A comparison between five nearly identically equipped snowcoaches that had CO emissions ranging between 12 and 310 g/mi suggests that snow and road conditions are the most important factors behind the large emissions variability observed between modern snowcoaches. The first comprehensive emission measurements, using a portable emissions measurement system, on two snowmobiles showed that computer-controlled fuel management systems have increased fuel economy (>25 mpg) and are a major reason that emissions from these winter vehicles have dropped so dramatically. Using all of the tailpipe emissions data collected to date shows that the two primary winter vehicles in Yellowstone National Park are now very similar in their per-passenger emissions.

AB  - This study presented the first molecular phylogenetic analysis of the major clades of woody bamboos of the Old World tropics based on nuclear and chloroplast sequences (ITS, GBSSI and trnL-F). Sequence data from 53 species, representing 17 paleotropical woody bamboo genera, were analyzed using the maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. All examined ingroup taxa were clustered into two clacles, i.e., the Bambusinae + Dinochloa clade and the Melocanninae clade. The former clade included Bambusa, Bonia, Dendrocalamus, Dendrocalamopsis, Dinochloa, Gigantochloa, Molecalamus, Neomicrocalamus, Neosinocalamus, Oxytenanthera s. str. (sensu stricto), Racemobambos and Thyrsostachys. The Melocanninae clacle consisted of Cephalostachyum, Leptocanna (better treated as part of Cephalostachyum), Melocanna, Pseudostachyum and Schizostachyum s. str. The subtribe Racemobambosinae and tribes Dendrocalameae and Oxytenanthereae were not supported and may be better placed in subtribe Bambusinae. The ovary characters seemed to be good criteria to distinguish these two clades. The reconstruction of ancestral fruit characters indicated that the bacoid caryopsis, namely, fleshy or berry-like fruits, was found to be scattered in three lineages of the examined paleotropical woody bamboos.

AB  - Purse seine fishing on fish aggregating devices (FADs) has expanded considerably during the last 15 yr in tropical tuna purse seine fisheries, and FADs currently account for about 70 % of their reported tuna catches. The scientific community has expressed concern over the consequences of this fishing practice in terms of yield per recruit and suspected detrimental effects on FAD-associated tunas. To explore possible detrimental effects, we compared stomach fullness, fish plumpness, growth rate, and migration behaviour between free school and drifting FAD-associated tunas for skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis and yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares caught in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Significant differences in fish plumpness and individual growth rates were found, suggesting that individuals associated with drifting FADs were less healthy than those in free schools. Since stomach fullness indicated that tunas associated with FADs eat less than those in free schools, the difference in growth rate and condition could be the consequence of altered feeding patterns. For each species, significant changes in migratory direction and displacement rates were observed in the presence of drifting FADs. These findings support the hypothesis that FADs act as a super-stimulus, misleading tunas to make inappropriate habitat selection. However, further studies are required to investigate the long-term effect of FADs on the entire life cycle of tunas.

AB  - The aim of this research is to provide a molecular tool based on polypeptide mapping to investigate the flowering marine plant Posidonia oceanica. This plant is very vulnerable to contaminants; thus it is considered a valuable bio-indicator of water quality in bio-monitoring of coastal environments. Posidonia oceanica was found to be recalcitrant to the common protein extraction methods. In the present work, three different extraction procedures were compared to obtain high yield and quality protein extracts suitable for mono-dimensional and bi-dimensional electrophoresis (1-DE and 2-DE). Proteins were extracted from juvenile, intermediate and adult leaves in order to assess the influence of tissue differentiation on protein yield. The highest protein yield was obtained with 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation of proteins. The best extraction efficiency was found in juvenile leaves as compared with intermediate and adult ones. However, as a large amount of juvenile leaves is required for obtaining sufficiently large protein samples, these were considered not suitable for the electrophoretic analysis. Extensive sampling could introduce further damage in the meadows under study. High quality 2-DE polypeptide mappings were obtained only from intermediate and adult leaves; the good reproducibility of protein patterns indicates that this approach could be used to explore changes in protein expression of P. oceanica in response to altered environmental conditions.

AB  - Coral reefs in the Florida Keys are severely degraded with a reported 38% loss between 1996 and 2000, yet the causes of these devastating declines remain largely unknown. Our long-term studies in the Upper Keys and Biscayne National Park indicate acute stress events affecting physiological condition in species representing different trophic levels in the reef community, one of which was white grunt (Haemulon plumieri; Lacepede, 1801). We initiated a preliminary investigation describing cellular physiological stress effects and the possible causes of these stress events using cellular diagnostic profiling coupled with a cursory body-load contaminant chemistry analysis. The cellular biomarker profiles from fish taken from Alina's Reef indicated a toxic response profile that was suggestive of a suicide reaction of the cytochrome P450 2-class as a result of an interaction with a xenobiotic that adversely affects heme metabolism. Elevated levels of damaged porphyrin products were also found in fish from Alina's Reef. Liver loads of anthropogenic contaminants ( e. g., pesticides, PCBs) were measured and provided further evidence for possible causative agents. Evaluation and synthesis of each type of data were used to establish a biological effect, develop a mechanism of pathogenicity, and build a profile for possible causative agent(s).

AB  - Chironomid assemblages in thirty-three mountain lakes situated above tree line in the Slovakian part of the Tatra Mountains were studied during 2000-2002. Chironomid species/taxa, collected as pupal exuviae, were correlated with physical, chemical, and lake morphometry variables of 22 lakes. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) was used to classify the lakes into four distinct groups: higher situated alpine lakes, lower situated alpine lakes, subalpine lakes and acidified lakes. Presence/absence of eight taxa, was identified as indicative for this classification. In discriminant function analysis, pH, dissolved organic carbon, altitude and lake area were the most significant variables reflecting differences among groups of lakes. This model of four variables allowed 77% success in the prediction of group membership. A multiple regression model with lake area, concentration of magnesium and total phosphorus accounted for 37% of the variance in taxa richness. Lakes with greater area contained more chironomid taxa, than smaller ones. Lakes with higher alkalinity and higher trophic status tend to support more taxa. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that most variation in the composition of chironomid assemblages was related to pH and to altitude. The results can be used as reference data for long-term monitoring of the Tatra lakes, especially in connection with a recovery from acidification and global climatic change.

AB  - The effect of annual variation of daily average soil temperature, at different depths, in calculating pesticides ranking indexes retardation factor and attenuation factor is presented. The retardation factor and attenuation factor are two site-specific pesticide numbers, frequently used as screening indicator indexes for pesticide groundwater contamination potential. Generally, in the calculation of these two factors are not included the soil temperature effect on the parameters involved in its calculation. It is well known that the soil temperature affects the pesticide degradation rate, water-air partition coefficient and water-soil partition coefficient. These three parameters are components of the retardation factor and attenuation factor and contribute to determine the pesticide behavior in the environment. The Arrhenius equation, van't Hoff equation and Clausius-Clapeyron equation are used in this work for estimating the soil temperature effect on the pesticide degradation rate, water-air partition coefficient and soil-water partition coefficient, respectively. These dependence relationships, between results of calculating attenuation and retardation factors and the soil temperature at different depths, can aid to understand the potential pesticide groundwater contamination on different weather conditions. Numerical results will be presented with pesticides atrazine and lindane in a soil profile with 20 degreesC constant temperature, minimum and maximum surface temperatures varying and spreading in the soil profile between -5 and 30 degreesC and between 15 and 45 degreesC.

AB  - The article describes the use of Scots pine bark to identify nitrogen sources in eastern Germany, as well as background areas in Russia and Bulgaria, by using natural isotope ratios of total nitrogen (N-t) and individual N compounds such as ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and amid nitrogen (amide-N). The samples collected were analysed using an elemental analyser in connection with a gas isotope mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Natural N-15 abundances in pine bark from impact areas suggest that the ammonium accumulated on the surface of the bark is released from livestock management. Bark of Scots pines growing near agricultural land had highly depleted delta N-15(t) values (between -8 and -12 parts per thousand), while bark from background areas (unpolluted areas) displayed slightly negative delta N-15(t) values (mean N-15(t) = -3.8 parts per thousand). It is assumed that part of the N adsorbed on the bark surface is mainly derived from ammonia (mean N-15(t) = -40.3 parts per thousand) escaping from livestock housing and during the application of manure. This assumption is confirmed by experiments under controlled conditions in which manure samples were spread on soil. In addition, temporal and spatial variations of N-15(t) abundances in pine bark from various locations in eastern Germany as well as pine stands in Nature Park Dubener Heath are discussed.

AB  - Severe protein C deficiency is a rare, early onset, venous thrombotic condition that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The protein C (PROC) genes of nine unrelated individuals with severe protein C deficiency were sequenced yielding a total of 13 different lesions. Eight of these were novel, including a gross gene deletion. three missense mutations, two micro-deletions, a splicing mutation and a single base-pair substitution in the HNF-3 binding sire in the PROC gene promoter. Evidence for the pathogenicity of the mutations detected was obtained by molecular modelling, in vitro splicing assay and reporter gene assay. Neither the plasma protein C activity level nor the nature of the PROC gene lesions detected were found to be a good prognostic indicator of the age of onset or clinical severity of thrombotic symptoms. Other factors may thus complicate the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype, indeed, in two patients, the inheritance of either one or two Factor V Leiden alleles in addition to two PROC gene lesions could have served to precipitate the thrombotic events. No association was however apparent between clinical severity and the possession of a particular promoter polymorphism genotype. Despite the absence of a clear genotype-phenotype relationship, the molecular genetic analysis of the severe recessive form of protein C deficiency potentiates both the counselling of affected families and the prevision of antenatal exclusion diagnosis.

AB  - A wide range of rates of downstream fining in gravel-bed rivers has been reported. As a consequence, explanations of the phenomenon range from those that consider only abrasion to others that consider only selective sediment transport. This apparent confusion results in part from inconsistent definitions of downstream fining. Analysis of results from a small gravel-bed stream is used to show how the method of sediment sampling and the percentile used to characterize fining rates can affect the results. When fining is adequately defined, a theoretical relationship between fining rate and drainage-basin area is derived from established alluvial-fan relations. This relationship is remarkably consistent with a range of studies by numerous authors using often different methods. Such results suggest that fining is achieved through the mechanism of selective transport but that the overall control on fining patterns is the volume of sediment supplied from within the drainage basin. As such, the rate of size decline in sedimentary deposits such as river terraces has the potential to be used to infer past changes in climate, tectonics, and/or relative base level. Models of this are presented, and these are shown to be broadly consistent with observations made in an ancient sandstone body. Full use of changing rates of fining as paleo-environmental indicators requires further work on the rate of adjustment of fining profiles with respect to the rates of change in the forcing environmental conditions.

AB  - The ecological risk assessment of toxicants in soil requires reproducible and relevant test systems using a wide range of species. To supplement present test methods from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in artificial soil with earthworms and springtails, a toxicity test in OECD artificial soil has been developed using the bacterivorous nematode Plectus acuminatus (Bastian, 1865) (Nematoda; Plectidae). The juvenile to adult ratio was used as a test parameter since previous life-cycle studies pointed out that fitness of P. acuminatus was strongly determined by changes in both reproduction and juvenile survival. Optimal conditions for the performance of nematodes in OECD artificial soil were determined (pH(KCl) = 5.5, temperature = 20 degrees C, and a moisture content of 70% dry wt. artificial soil), and tests were conducted with cadmium, copper, and pentachlorophenol. After an exposure period pf 3 weeks the EC50 for cadmium was 321.0 +/- 1.7 mg/kg dry wt., and the no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) was 32 mg/kg dry wt. The EC50 for pentachlorophenol was 47.9 +/- 1.2 mg/kg dry wt., and the NOEC was <10 mg/kg dry wt. For copper the EC50 was 162 +/- 0.2 mg/kg dry wt., and the NOEC was 32 mg/kg dry wt. It is concluded that the nematode rest may well supplement current soil test systems using earthworms and springtails.

AB  - Aquatic plant communities are good indicators of lake conditions, and persistent changes to those communities are indicative of environmental change. Our study used historical and recent lake plant surveys to detect changes in Minnesota's lake plant communities over the last century. We did not find taxa richness estimates useful for change detection and suggest that recent richness values were higher than historical due to increased search effort rather than real change. The primary signal of change was the failure to relocate taxa in lakes where they were historically common. In 55 % of the lakes, surveyors did not relocate at least one taxon that was reported in an historic survey. We found that emergent plant taxa were most likely to have been lost; for lakes where emergents were reported historically, 45% had at least one emergent taxon that was not redetected compared to 30% of lakes where at least one floating-leaf taxon was not redetected and 42% of lakes where at least one submerged taxon was not redetected. Lakes in the southwestern and central ecoregions of the state were most likely to have gross and persistent aquatic plant losses. Eutrophication was the most likely reason for losses, with substantial declines in the probability of presence of many taxa with greater increases in lake phosphorus concentrations. We identified limitations with these datasets and recommend survey method changes to improve future collection of lake plant lists.

AB  - Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an almost universal complication of this condition. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a key-player in mineral metabolism, is reportedly associated with anemia and hemoglobin levels in non-dialysis CKD patients. Here, we sought to further characterize this association while taking into account the biologically active, intact fraction of FGF23, iron metabolism, and erythropoietin (EPO). Hemoglobin, EPO, iron, and mineral metabolism parameters, including both intact and c-terminal-FGF23 (iFGF23 and cFGF23, respectively) were measured cross-sectionally in 225 non-dialysis CKD patients (stage 1-5, median eGFR: 30 mL/min./1.73m(2)) not on erythropoiesis stimulating agents or intravenous iron therapy. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression. After adjustment for eGFR and other important confounders, only cFGF23 but not iFGF23 was significantly associated with hemoglobin levels and this association was largely accounted for by iron metabolism parameters. cFGF23 but not iFGF23 was also associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), again in dependence on iron metabolism parameters. Similarly, EPO concentrations were associated with cFGF23 but not iFGF23, but their contribution to the association of cFGF23 with hemoglobin levels was marginal. In pre-dialysis CKD patients, the observed association of FGF23 with hemoglobin seems to be restricted to cFGF23 and largely explained by the iron status.

AB  - The Food-Energy-Water (FEW) nexus for urban sustainability needs to be analyzed via an integrative rather than a sectoral or silo approach, reflecting the ongoing transition from separate infrastructure systems to an integrated social-ecological-infrastructure system. As technology hubs can provide food, energy, water resources via decentralized and/or centralized facilities, there is an acute need to optimize FEW infrastructures by considering cost-benefit-risk tradeoffs with respect to multiple sustainability indicators. This paper identifies, categorizes, and analyzes global trends with respect to contemporary FEW technology metrics that highlights the possible optimal integration of a broad spectrum of technology hubs for possible cost-benefit-risk tradeoffs. The challenges related to multiscale and multiagent modeling processes for the simulation of urban FEW systems were discussed with respect to the aspects of scaling-up, optimization process, and risk assessment. Our review reveals that this field is growing at a rapid pace and the previous selection of analytical methodologies, nexus criteria, and sustainability indicators largely depended on individual FEW nexus conditions disparately, and full-scale cost-benefit-risk tradeoffs were very rare. Therefore, the potential full-scale technology integration in three ongoing cases of urban FEW systems in Miami (the United States), Marseille (France), and Amsterdam (the Netherlands) were demonstrated in due purpose finally.

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - Many attempts to conceptualize and to assess the performance of media systems or single news media outlets focus on the "supply side" of public communication, operationalized as characteristics of the news content and the form of presentation. These characteristics indicate the potential performance of news media; they are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for media performance. In order to assess the actual performance of news media we need to know what kind of audiences they reach, how they fulfil their users' news-related interests and needs, and how they contribute to their users' perceptions of the news environment. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework for the definition of audience-based indicators for news media performance. We apply this framework to data gathered as part of the 2019 Reuters Institute Digital News Survey for Germany. We compare 42 news media, both online and offline, in regard to their reach in different parts of the population, and to their audiences' interest in news and politics, their trust in media, and their perceptions of the overall performance of German news media. The findings underline that news media performance is a multidimensional concept and that there are different ways in which news media can perform. Furthermore, the particular type of media, technically or organizationally, still matters when it comes to audiences' expectations and perceived functions.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of electric drive of shearers simulation to assess the indicators of power supply system (PSS) energy efficiency in the context of the introduction of modern devices for controlling the flow of electricity and power. The block diagram of the shearer electric drive simulation model is presented. To take into account fluctuations in the level of consumption of active and reactive power, a model of the executive body of the shearer was used in the work, including a model of the moment of resistance on the auger when cutting. As a result, in the MATLAB Simulink environment, a simulation model of the electric drive of the UKD300 shearer was developed, suitable for assessing the energy efficiency of the electrical complex of mining areas and the feasibility of using modern devices for controlling the flow of electricity and power. As a result of the simulation, it was found that a significant irregularity in the graph of reactive power consumption, caused by repeated short-term operation, makes the use of capacitor units ineffective to compensate for reactive power. It was revealed that the influence of the feed drive on the sinusoidality of the current curve is insignificant, however, in the conditions of further use of frequency control for the shearer cutting drive, it is advisable to use explosion-proof FACTS devices.

AB  - Studies of sustainable development of wastewater systems require consideration of three sustainability pillars: environmental, social and economic. The present study measures the overall sustainability and ranks the alternatives according to their social, environmental and economic performance. Taking life cycle approach, this framework integrates the three sustainability dimensions to enable assessment of Wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs). The framework comprises eighteen indicators derived from environmental life cycle assessment, economic performance and social life cycle assessment, then fuzzy logic analysis was used to assess and identify the most sustainable wastewater treatment facility option by means of a Sustainability Global Index (SGI). SEWATS was applied to four WWTF: Parque Naucalli and Iztapalapa in Mexico, and Los Angeles and Phoenix in USA. The results illustrate that the facility with the highest SGI is in Los Angeles, which recovers energy during sludge treatment by capturing methane biogas for electricity generation, and the worst facility is in Naucalpan, which generates the highest impacts related to wastewater treatment due to the absence of a sludge treatment system, the small treatment capacity and the regular social conditions during operation. This study is one of the first studies to develop a methodology for selecting the best WWTF alternatives based on environmental and social life cycle assessments and fuzzy treatment analysis. The framework developed and applied in this work could help identify appropriate WWTFs worldwide for sustainable water management.

AB  - Several studies on the impact of cell culture parameters on the profile of host cell protein (HCP) impurities have been carried out in shake flasks. Herein, we explore how transferable the findings and conclusions of such investigations are to lab-scale bioreactors. Experiments were performed in both systems in fed-batch mode under physiological temperature and with a shift to mild hypothermia and the impact on key upstream performance indicators was quantified. Under both temperatures, bioreactors produced a richer HCP pool despite the overall concentration being similar at both scales and temperatures. The number of different HCPs detected in bioreactor supernatants was four times higher than that in flasks under physiological temperature and more than eight times higher under mild hypothermia. The origin of HCPs was also altered from mostly naturally secreted proteins in flasks to mainly intracellular proteins in bioreactors at the lower temperature. Although the number of species correlated with apoptotic cell density in bioreactors, this was not the case in flasks. Even though the level of HCP impurities and mAb/HCP concentration ratio were similar under all four conditions with an average of approximately 330 mu g HCP/mL culture and 0.3 mg HCP/mg IgG4, respectively, the fact that culture method significantly affects the number of species present in the supernatant can have implications for downstream processing steps.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Major depression disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are characterized by the use of perseverative cognition (PC) as a dysfunctional coping strategy. We sought to investigate the dysfunctional physiological and psychological consequences of PC and how the valence of social interactions moderates such consequences in these psychopathological conditions. Design/Methods: The study combined 24-hour heart rate variability (HRV) and ecological momentary assessments in 48 individuals with MDD, SAD, and sex-matched controls. Results: In all participants, PC was associated with mood worsening and reduced ability of the parasympathetic nervous system, mainly the vagus, to inhibit sympathetic arousal (i.e., reduced HRV). Individuals with SAD had the highest frequency of daily PC, while those with MDD reported that PC interfered more with their ongoing activities. In SAD, daily PC was associated with significantly lower HRV after negative social interactions. Individuals with MDD reported higher levels of sadness during PC irrespective of the valence of the preceding social interaction but higher levels of anxiety and efforts to inhibit PC following positive interactions. Conclusions: Results highlight the need to account for important moderators like the valence of social interaction when looking at the physiological consequences of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies.

So that, the effect of physiological activity of synthesized salt and 0.001-0.0001% solutions of complex compounds on the seeds of tobacco plants was investigated in a Petri dish under laboratory conditions and the results of the study of their physiological effects on the seeds were presented. It was found that, the solutions of isobutylamine complex compounds of synthesized natural petroleum acids compared to control variant of the seeds and sodium, potassium, monoethanolamine, dietanolamine, triethanolamine, isopropylamine complex compounds of other natural petroleum acids have provided a higher germination percentage than that of complex compounds. The results of research on the effects of the solutions on the root and trunk systems of plants have shown that they have a stimulating effect on plants. The physical and chemical properties of the synthesized compounds were investigated. IR spectrum of isobutylamine complex compound of natural petroleum acids is drawn, it was determined that NPA's inherent 1702, 935 cm(-1) cm field lose the absorption strips and new absorption lines are formed in the areas 2597, 2687, 1535, 1627 cm(-1). This also indicates the formation of ammonium complex.

AB  - Forestry with exotic species plays an important socioeconomic role in Brazil, providing raw material for the production of wood, firewood, charcoal, cellulose, among others. In this sense, it becomes necessary to deepen the knowledge about the environmental variables that control the productivity of Pinus, especially the edaphic ones. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the spatial variability of soil and plant chemical attributes in a commercial plantation of Pinus caribaea var. Hondurensis. The experiment was installed on the campus of the Faculty of Engineering of Ilha Solteira (Unesp), located in Selviria, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in a RED OXYSOL Dystroferric, very clayey texture. The following soil chemical attributes were analyzed: phosphorus (P), organic matter (OM), hydrogen ionic potential (pH), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potential acidity (C), base saturation (V%), calcium (CaT), magnesium (MgT) and aluminum (m) in CEC (Cationic Exchange Capacity). All soil and plant attributes presented simple spatial dependence in the studied area, except for height, diameter at breast height and potential acidity in the 0.10-0.20 m layer, evidencing that Pinus management can be performed according to the specific site in the conditions of the study. Potassium was the soil attribute that best correlated with the productivity of Pinus in volume, as well as the best indicators for the estimation of productivity.

AB  - Compared to technical infrastructure, nature-based solutions (NBS) strive to work with nature and to move beyond business-as-usual practices. Despite decades of research from various academia fields and a commencing mainstreaming of the term, a lack of cohesiveness and pertinent methods regarding the subject matter hinders further implementation. Using a functional landscape approach, this paper aims to identify the spatial extent of existing and potential NBS locations and applies it across a case study in Germany. Inspired by hydrological models, which work with delineated hydrological response units, this research instead defines hydromorphological landscape units (HLU) based on biophysical spatial criteria to identify the potential areas that could function as NBS. This approach was tested for floodplain-based NBS. The identified HLU were then compared with historical floodplain and land-use data to differentiate between active or potential NBS. The spatial delineation identified 3.6 million hectares of already active floodplains areas, for which we recommend continued or modified protection measures, and 0.4 million ha where the hydromorphological conditions are apt to support floodplains, yet are cut-off from the flooding regime and require rehabilitation measures. The identification of NBS through explicitly defined HLU serves as a spatial approach to support NBS implementation. Taken together, our research can provide an essential contribution to systemize the emerging scholarship on NBS in river landscapes and to help in selecting and planning appropriate NBS in practice.

AB  - The objective of this research was to explore the fundamental reactions between chlorine/chloramine and 2-hydroxy1-4-methoxyl benzophenone (BP3)/2-hydroxyl-4-methoxyl benzophenone-sulfonic acid (BP4), which were the most common reactions in benzophenone-type UV filters during drinking water treatment processes. Both BP3 and BP4 could react with free chlorine and chloramine, with reactions following pseudo-first-order kinetics in excess of chlorine (HClO) and chloramine (NH2Cl). Generally, chlorination was more rapid than chloramination. BP4 was less reactive than BP3 toward both chlorine and chloramine, due to the presence of an electron-accepting sulfonate group. Therefore, BP3 had a significantly higher disinfection by-products (DBP) formation potential than BP4. Chlorination of BP3 and BP4 generated remarkably higher levels of DBPs than chloramination, with high pH conditions facilitating the formation of chloroform but inhibiting the formation of haloacetic acid (HAAs). Comparison of the reaction behavior of two different BP-type UV filters, i.e., BP3 and BP4, revealed that certain functional groups significantly affected the reactivity of BP-type UV filters in chlorination and chloramination processes. This contribution may provide new insights into the reaction behavior of UV filters during drinking water disinfection process using chlorine and/or chloramine as disinfectant, and provide guidelines for drinking water safety management.

AB  - Agricultural machinery plays an important role on the environmental sustainability assessments of the agricultural sector and, in particular, a prominent part of its impact is due to fuel consumption and engine exhaust gases emissions.
   In order to adopt trustworthy data on agricultural machinery operations for fulfilling reliable local inventories in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies, field tests were performed. During the trials several operations were monitored (i.e. ploughing, spike harrowing, rotary harrowing, sowing and rolling) and the measured data with CAN-bus (among which the fuel consumption) and with the engine exhaust gases emissions analyser (CO2, CO and NOx) were attributed to the field working states of effective work, turns at headlands and stops that were identified thanks to GPS. Moreover, data during the farm-field transfers were also collected.
   In addition to data processing from the field trials, a model for predicting fuel consumption and engine exhaust gases emissions was adopted and its reliability was studied for further future uses.
   From the results, specific considerations about the tested tractor (Valtra N101, 82 kW maximum power, IIIA emission stage) and the studied working conditions (e.g., engine speed, torque, working speed and depth) can be performed to get information valid for the engine and the operations.

AB  - The artificial neural network consists of a large number of neurons interconnected to each other, which simulates the information process mode of human brains. This is a complex network system that carries out parallel processing of information and nonlinear transformation. The agricultural land in China is characterized by fine fragmentation, and people-land relation is tense. In order to promote the intensive development of agriculture in China, this paper takes 31 provinces and cities as research objects and proposes an evaluation model based on adaptive fuzzy neural network (ANFIS) for the scale effect of fragmented agricultural land transfer to overcome the subjectivity of traditional evaluation methods. In order to improve the accuracy of the evaluation, the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods is used to screen the indicators, and the subtraction clustering method is used to obtain the initial fuzzy rules of the adaptive fuzzy neural network. Then, the adaptive fuzzy neural network model can be trained and tested and the convergence results of the model are good. The results of model analysis show that under different resource endowments and production conditions, the scale effect of land transfer in different regions presents significant differences. On this basis, it is proposed that the intensification process of the agricultural land use cannot be blindly promoted, and the land transfer should follow the principle of moderation. Appropriate agricultural production models should be formulated based on different geographical environments.

AB  - Public management recognizes the importance of air quality management programs as a way of monitoring potentially polluting activities. An alternative to monitoring air quality in regions with limited financial resources, as indicated by the World Health Organization, is the use of biological monitoring with plants. The objective of this work is to carry out a diagnosis of atmospheric pollution with the application of a biological low-cost method. The study was conducted in Sao Mateus do Sul, Parana, Brasil, a city that which hosts several schist industries. Thebiological monitoring was used to estimate the atmospheric contamination from mining activities. The contents of 12 chemical elements in tree bark samples were analyzed. In order to interpret the results, geostatistical tools were used in combination with the data about respiratory diseases, registered in the Unified Health System (secondary data). Iron, sulfur and silicon were the elements that presented the highest average concentrations, much higher than the control region. The results reinforce that the main source of these elements is the mining activity in Sao Mateus do Sul, and the regions with the highest incidence of respiratory diseases coincided with regions where the levels of pollutants were higher. With this proposal, health authorities can request the biological the monitoring of the most critical points of pollutant emitters, analyze the living conditions of the population and improve the performance of health and sustainability indicators in the surroundings of mining industries.

AB  - It is widely accepted that pine plantation forests will play a critical role in climate change (CC) mitigation, but their vulnerability to CC impacts raises questions about their role. We modeled the impacts of changing climatic variables on forest growth, optimal harvest age, and land expectation value (LEV) for 11 representative slash pine sites in the Southeastern U.S. under two alternative climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5). Our coupled modeling approach incorporated the 3-PG biological process model, a generalized carbon sequestration economic model, and Pressler's indicator rate formula to determine relative changes in prices, timber and carbon production. We generally found weak impacts of CC on slash pine LEVs and optimal harvest ages, but our results were sensitive to site productivity and location. CC increased LEVs in sites with low productivity for both RCPs. While a 1 degrees C increase led to the greatest LEV increase in Northeastern sites with low and moderate forest productivity conditions, Southeastern sites showed the greatest decreases in LEV. Higher (lower) future land values would shorten (lengthen) the current harvest age for slash pine. Changes in the rate of carbon and stumpage prices had the greatest impact on the rate of marginal economic revenues of slash pine.

AB  - This letter explored the influence of atmospheric convection scheme on El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) predictions using a set of hindcast experiments. Specifically, a low-resolution version of the Climate Forecast System version 2 is used for 12 month hindcasts starting from each April during 1982-2011. The hindcast experiments are repeated with three atmospheric convection schemes. All three hindcasts apply the identical initialization with ocean initial conditions taken from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and atmosphere/land initial states from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Assessments indicate a substantial sensitivity of the sea surface temperature prediction skill to the different convection schemes, particularly over the eastern tropical Pacific. For the Nino 3.4 index, the anomaly correlation skill can differ by 0.1-0.2 at lead times longer than 2 months. Long-term simulations are further conducted with the three convection schemes to understand the differences in prediction skill. By conducting heat budget analyses for the mixed-layer temperature anomalies, it is suggested that the convection scheme having the highest skill simulates stronger and more realistic coupled feedbacks related to ENSO. Particularly, the strength of the Ekman pumping feedback is better represented, which is traced to more realistic simulation of surface wind stress. Our results imply that improving the mean state simulations in coupled (ocean-atmosphere) general circulation model (e.g., ameliorating the Intertropical Convergence Zone simulation) might further improve our ENSO prediction capability.

AB  - Global resource use has been expanding rapidly after 1950 and improved material living conditions and human well-being of large parts of the global population. We here apply a cumulative long-term perspective to gain broader insights into the material requirements of human well-being, the role of trade and the history of environmental pressures than the usual perspective of annual or most recent flows would reveal. Furthermore, we investigate environmental pressures expressed as cumulative extraction per area over the last 60 years. To both ends, we utilize cumulative data on material flows on domestic material inputs (DMI) and domestic extraction (DE) for 148 countries from 1950 - to 2010 and the Social Progress Index. We find that a high level of well-being required at least 460 t/cap of cumulative material inputs from 1950- to 2010. An analysis of the relation between cumulative flows and current human well-being shows statistically significant that at similar levels of cumulative material inputs, biophysical export-orientation of a country has a weak negative influence on well-being. When the Sustainable Development Goals are to be achieved, the scientific community and policy makers have to consider the history of development of resource use to better understand the future challenges ahead.

AB  - The authors describe the preparation of molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) for the solid phase extraction of hippuric acid (HA). The MINPs consists of a water-compatible organic-inorganic silica composite which was obtained from a functionalized silica by the sol-gel method. HA acted as the template, 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane as the functional monomer, and tetraethoxysilane as the crosslinker. Subsequently, methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane was used as a coupling agent to deposit a hydrophilic acrylamide coating onto the surface of the MINPs. The morphology and structure of the resulting restricted access material (referred to as RAM-MINP) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Solid phase extraction of HA was accomplished by passing urine samples through a RAM-MINP-packed SPE cartridge. Following elution, HA was quantified by HPLC using UV detection at 228 nm. The effects of sample pH, amount of sorbent and eluent and washing solvent volumes were optimized by experimental design methodology under response surface methodology. Under optimized conditions, the mean extraction efficiency of HA from spiked samples is adequately repeatable, with relative standard deviations of < 6.1%. The limits of detection and quantitation are 0.15 and 0.25 mu g.L-1, respectively.

AB  - Confined molecular chambers such as macrocycle bridged E-1-H...H-E-2 (E-1(E-2) = Si(Si), 1) exhibit rare ultrashort HH nonbonded contacts (d(H...H) = 1.56 angstrom). In this article, on the basis of density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we propose new molecular motifs where d(H...H) can be reduced to 1.44 angstrom (E-1(E-2) = Si(Ge), 3). Further tuning the structure of the macrocycle by replacing the bulky phenyl groups by ethylenic spacers and substitution of the H-atoms by -CN groups makes the cavity more compact and furnishes even shorter d(HH) = 1.38 angstrom (E-1(E-2) = Ge(Ge), 8). These unusually close HH nonbonded contacts originate from the strong attractive noncovalent interactions between them, which are evident from various computational indicators, namely, NCI, Wiberg bond index, relaxed force constant, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, and natural orbitals for chemical valence combined with the extended transition state method analyses. Substantial stabilization of the in,in-configuration (exhibiting short HH contacts) compared with the out,out-configuration (by similar to 5.7 kcal/mol) and statistically insignificant fluctuations in < d(H....H)> and <theta(av)> (theta(E-1(E-2)-H....H = 152 degrees) at room temperature confirm that the ultrashort HH distances in these molecules are thermodynamically stable and would be persistent under ambient experimental conditions.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) techniques and Geographical information system (GIS) applications, which provide more economical and time saving methods than ground-based measurements, have been widely used for earth observation and environmental assessments. Thus, consider Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, the present and past conditions of the coniferous species and land change that are within 100 meters away from the road alignment were evaluated to explain the changes in the road effect zone. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat images of the years between 2000 and 2015 were performed by using thresholds to estimate temporal and spatial changes of the coniferous species. The value of thresholds (0.45<NDVI<0.65) for the NDVI reflections from healthy coniferous species have been taken into consideration in summer season. Binary classification was applied for NDVI reflection values of productive coniferous forests (PcF) and degraded coniferous forests (DcF), and then comparisons were performed to investigate temporal and spatial changes. The results investigated that approximately 18 % of the coniferous forests within the 100 m road buffer zone were turned into DcF. Beside beekeeping, grazing and social activities are defined as disturbances in research area. In conclusion, current roadside forestry applications and managements for road edges needs improved techniques and planning for sustainable management in forest road zones.

AB  - This study investigates the drill core 3.00 m in length obtained from DSK-3 drilling carried out in the depth of 10:00 m in the southeast of Tuzla (Istanbul) and in the northwest of Bayramoglu in order to present the marine pollution caused by Dil Stream through the instrumentality of bioindicators (foraminifera, ostracods and molluscs). The purpose of the study is to reveal the adverse conditions caused by the uncontrolled waste disposal from the industry which has been evolving for a long time around Dil Stream located in the provincial borders of Kocaeli. It is not possible under the present circumstances to do any research in the area where Dil Stream discharges into the sea. Therefore, the core obtained from the drilling carried out in Bayramoglu is analyzed by considering the flows in the western portion of Gulf of Izmit. In addition, this study also makes use of the results of the analysis of the samples collected at and around the mouth of the stream by TUBITAK in 2013 for the purpose of demonstrating the environmental pollution in the region. In conclusion, coloration and deformation of the heavy metals and benthic foraminifera which the core samples contain are determined and the adverse outcomes caused by the untreated waste discharged into Dil Stream are demonstrated.

AB  - Reforestation of saline sodic soil is increasingly undertaken as a means of reclaiming otherwise unproductive agricultural land. Currently, restoration of degraded land is limited to species with high tolerances of salinity. Biochar application has the potential to improve physical, biological and chemical properties of these soils to allow establishment of a wider range of plants. In a glasshouse trial, we applied biochar made from Acacia pycnantha (5Mgha(-1)) or no biochar to either a low (ECe 475 dS m(-1), ESP 69), a moderate (ECe 276 dS m(-1), ESP 293) or a high (ECe 494 dS m(-1), ESP 451) saline sodic soil. The regional common reforestation species Eucalyptus viminalis and Acacia mearnsii were planted as tubestock in to the soils. Early establishment indicators, including growth, plant condition and nutrition, were assessed at the end of a simulated growing season, 108days after biochar application. Application of biochar increased height, and decreased root:shoot and the concentration of Mn, N and S in plants of E.viminalis when grown in the highly saline sodic soil. Biochar application increased the concentration of B in leaves of E.viminalis and increased the concentration of P, K and S in leaves of A.mearnsii when grown in the low saline sodic soil. The results confirm that there is potential for biochar to assist in reforestation of saline sodic soils. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A simple and inexpensive method was used to develop a novel electrochemical sensor for the determination of phenazopyridine hydrochloride (PAP). Differential pulse voltammetry was used for the electrochemical investigation of the interaction of PAP with calf thymus ds-DNA at a pencil graphite electrode (PGE) based on the reduced oxidation signals of guanine and adenine. The biosensor was constructed using pretreated pencil graphite electrode (PGE) modified with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and chitosan (CHIT) decorated with ds-DNA. The reductions in the intensities of guanine and adenine oxidation signals after their interaction with PAP were used as indicators for the sensitive determination of PAP. The differences observed between adenine and guanine oxidation signals (of the ds-DNA) before and after their interaction with PAP were found to be directly proportional to PAP concentration, which was used for quantitative inspections. Under optimum conditions, a linear dependency was observed between guanine and adenine oxidation signals and PAP concentration in the range of 0.01-50 mu g/mL with a detection limit of 0.003 mu g/mL. The method was also found to be highly selective and was successfully employed for the determination of PAP in real samples such as human plasma and urine.

AB  - This paper is concerned with using multi-objective optimization by learning automata (MOLA) for economic emission dispatching in the environment where wind power and loads vary. With its capabilities of sequentially dimensional search and state memory, MOLA is able to find accurate solutions while satisfying two objectives: fuel cost coupled with environmental emission and voltage stability. Its searching quality and efficiency are measured using the hypervolume indicator for investigating the quality of Pareto front, and demonstrated by tracking the dispatch solutions under significant variations of wind power and load demand. The simulation studies are carried out on the modified midwestern American electric power system and the IEEE 118-bus test system, in which wind power penetration and load variations present. Evaluated on these two power systems, MOLA is fully compared with multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The simulation results have shown the superiority of MOLA over NAGA-II and MOEA/D, as it is able to obtain more accurate and widely distributed Pareto fronts. In the dynamic environment where the operation condition of both wind speed and load demand varies, MOLA outperforms the other two algorithms, with respect to the tracking ability and accuracy of the solutions.

AB  - Context: Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) related inflammation has an anorexigenic effect through affecting the release of appetite-modulating mediators, leptin and ghrelin. Elevated serum calprotectin levels are found in a variety of inflammatory conditions. Objective: To study the relation between ETS and body mass index (BMI), as well as serum levels of leptin, ghrelin and calprotectin. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was performed by searching the smoking status of parents. After filling in the questionnaires, parents were phoned and children were invited to supply fasting blood samples in order to measure serum levels of leptin, ghrelin and calprotectin, and to calculate their BMIs. Participant children were divided into Group 1 (n = 51), those who are not exposed to and Group 2 (n = 46), exposed to indoor ETS. Results: There were no statistical difference in BMI, leptin and ghrelin levels between Group 1 and Group 2 (p values are 0.85, 0.87 and 0.42, respectively), but serum calprotectin levels were statistically higher in Group 2 (p = 0.003). Discussion and conclusion: In this study serum levels of calprotectin were found to be higher in children with indoor ETS exposure where no relation was detected with BMI and serum levels of leptin and ghrelin. Increased serum levels of calprotectin might be an indicator of inflammation related to ETS exposure.

AB  - There is no question about the importance of understanding the fate of oil pollutants and the risks of individual components of gasoline to human health. To investigate the effects of major environmental factors on the volatilization of regular gasoline from unsaturated soils, a series of experiments were organized and performed on four typical Japanese soils under different temperature, soil organic matter content, and water content conditions. Quantitative assessment of risks of each residual gasoline component to human health was pioneered using the experimental results and a self-developed software program, Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment System (GERAS). Results of this study illustrated that (1) temperature and soil organic matter had significant effects on volatilization and thus on the residual concentrations of gasoline components remaining in unsaturated soils. These residual concentrations were positively related to the amount of soil organic matter, but inversely related to temperature. (2) Risks of residual gasoline components remaining in soils depended on exposure pathway, gasoline component, and carbon numbers. Risks of respiratory exposure due to vapor inhalation were generally higher than the risks of oral exposure due to intake of crops and water. (3) Although residual concentrations of gasoline components remaining in soils with high organic matter contents were high, their risks to human health were low. This is because high organic matter content has strong sorptivity for gasoline components, resulting in less vapor inhalation, less intake from water, and low bioavailability for crops.

AB  - The allelopathic potential of oat (Avena sativa L., var. Argentina, Poaceae, Cyperales) was investigated under field and laboratory conditions. In field trials, oat plants provided an effective control of weeds, showing a species-specific impact: the most abundant weed species, Picris echioides was reduced by 94% in number of individuals. Aerial parts of oat plants, harvested immediately before soil incorporation, were utilized in a bioassay-guided isolation, which was aimed at identifying the phytotoxic compounds in a methanol/water extract of the aerial parts of the plants. Further partitions of extract gave an active n-butanol portion composed of flavonoids and saponins. Phytotoxic activity was detected for the flavonoid fraction, whereas no activity was found for the saponin mixture. Germination of an indicator species, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), was completely inhibited at flavonoid concentrations of 6.7, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/mL, and conversely the number of abnormal seedlings was greatly increased from 2% of control to over 96% at concentrations equal to 6.7 and 10.0 mg/mL. Analysis of the flavonoid fraction by ESI-MS techniques identified two components of the mixture as isoorientin 2-O-glucoside and isovitexin 2aEuro(3)-O-arabinoside. Saponins were characterized as avenacoside A, avenacoside B, 26-desglucoavenacoside A, and 26-desglucoavenacoside B. Both flavone C-glycosides and saponins were isolated previously from oat.

AB  - Current interest in the large-scale use of biofuels has grown in response to both energy security and climate change concerns; however, it is also increasingly apparent that these benefits can come only at the expense of increased demand for agricultural resources such as land and water. Furthermore, recent studies also suggest that changes in land use patterns for energy crop cultivation can incur significant carbon debts that can only be recovered after many years of operation. The environmental feasibility of the use of energy crops to make biofuels can thus be viewed in terms of three main performance indicators-the land use, water and carbon footprints arising from a given level of system output. An optimal solution thus needs to account for tradeoffs that may be inherent in the conflicting objectives. This work presents a fuzzy multiple-objective modeling approach for determining optimal bioenergy system configuration given targets for the three footprint metrics. The fuzzy optimization approach is integrated with an input-output-based life cycle model for establishing system material and energy balances. The approach is demonstrated here through the analysis of different scenarios for the integrated production of biodiesel, ethanol and electricity under anticipated energy demand conditions in the Philippines.

AB  - By now artificial insemination in the dog is a well established breeding procedure. Depending on the situation, fresh undiluted semen, chilled or frozen semen may be used. In general semen is collected fractionated by manual stimulation (masturbation) in the presence a teaser bitch in standing heat. Only the sperm-rich fraction should be used for the production of chilled or frozen semen. As a diluent, tris-egg yolk-buffer is commonly used, antibiotics are added in the case of chilled semen, and glycerol for cryopreserved semen. Definition of the optimal time for insemination is crucial for breeding success, particularly when frozen semen is used. Vaginal cytology and vaginoscopy should be applied in conjunction with a determination of progesterone in order to define the optimal time for semen transfer (progesterone about 12 ng/ml plasma). At present, four insemination techniques are used: 1. deep intravaginal insemination, 2. transcervical-intrauterine insemination by means of a rigid catheter and transabdominal fixation of the cervix, 3. transcervical-intrauterine insemination by endoscopic control, and 4. surgical insemination via laparotomy/laparoscopy. Whenever possible, cryopreserved semen should be placed intrauterine. It is recommended to use at least 150 x 10(6) progressively motile spermatozoa for insemination. Provided optimal conditions, pregnancy rates and litter size have been shown to be equal to natural mating, even after the use of frozen semen.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging is a powerful tool to monitor temporal and spatial dynamics of photosynthesis and photosynthesis-related metabolism. In this communication, we use high resolution chlorophyll fluorescence imaging techniques under strictly controlled conditions to quantify day courses of relative effective quantum yield (phi(PSII)) of an entire leaf of the crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant Kalanchoe daigremontiana at different light intensities. Careful interpretation of the combined gas exchange and fluorescence data, in combination with micro malate samples, allow the interpretation of underlying metabolic properties, such as leaf internal CO2 concentration (ci(CO2)) and energy demand of the cells. Spatial variations of phi(PSII), which occur as running wave fronts at the transition from phase III to phase IV of CAM, may reflect spatial differences of ci(CO2), which are preserved in the tightly packed mesophyll cells of K. daigremontiana. An endogenous rhythm is driven by a master switch which mediates between malate storage and malate release to and from the vacuole, however, using fluorescence techniques, four different metabolic states can be distinguished which also account for the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase.

AB  - A model system was characterized which may be used as an in vivo screen for effects of chemicals or environmental mixtures on sexual differentiation and development of reproductive organs and gametes, We evaluated the effects of a model environmental estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (EE,), on the d-rR strain of medaka, Oryzias latipes, using a nana-injection exposure. Gonad histopathology indicated that a-single injection of 0.5-2.5 ng EE(2)/egg can cause phenotypic sex-reversal of genetic males to females. Sex-reversals could be detected as early as 7 days post-hatch, Sex-reversed males had female-typical duct development and the secondary:sex characteristics we measured were generally consistent with phenotype, with the exception of a few EE(2)-exposed XX and XY females which possessed ambiguous anal fins. Using discriminant analysis, we determined that the presence or absence of the secondary sex characteristic, a dorsal fin notch, was a very reliable indicator of gonadal sex. No instances of gonadal intersexes were observed, Ethinyl estradiol also appeared to reduce growth but not condition (weight-at-length) and exposed XX females appeared to have a higher incidence of atretic follicles relative to controls. Our results suggest that estrogenic chemicals may influence sexual differentiation and development:and that the medaka model is well suited to assessing these effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Effects of metal pollution from a zinc factory on microbenthic algal communities were assessed in three neighboring streams on the Dutch-Belgian border. Diatom species composition was experimentally related to water quality by transferring racks with colonized glass discs from a polluted stream to a reference stream and vice versa. The succession of species and the changes in biomass and metal accumulation were measured during experiments in spring, autumn, and winter. Metal concentrations and dry weight in translocated biofilms tended to conform with those in local biofilms within an incubation time of 14 to 18 days. Bray-Curtis similarity values from the different communities indicated that diatom communities responded more completely to the metal-polluted conditions than to the reference water quality. Cymbella minuta, Diatoma vulgare var. ehrenbergii, Navicula sp., and Melosira varians had a lower percentage in assemblages placed in the metal-polluted streams. In contrast, Pinnularia sp. and Neidium ampliatum decreased in assemblages from the polluted streams that were transferred to the reference stream. Achnanthes minutissima and Navicula seminulum (N. atomus) proliferated on any translocation, possibly reflecting an opportunistic strategy and a high tolerance for Zn and Cd. The behavior of the species in relation to metal pollution generally accorded with observations in the literature. However, it seems that metal tolerance is not the only selective factor, and other ecological variables may also influence the composition of microphytobenthic communities.

AB  - The size distribution of pyrite framboids from selected British Jurassic black shales is calibrated against a paleoecologically-determined, oxygen-restricted biofacies (ORB) scheme, revealing a close correspondence between the two data sets. Thus, euxinic conditions (H2S-bearing, O-2-free bottom waters) are characterized by tiny framboids (<5 mu m) with a narrow size range and an absence of benthic and nektobenthic taxa. Fissile strata with discrete, benthos-bearing bedding planes, variously termed lower dysaerobic, exaerobic, and poikiloaerobic biofacies in the literature, also have a euxinic framboid signature but with the addition of rare large diameter framboids. Upper dysaerobic biofacies contain substantially larger framboids with a broader size distribution. The utility of framboid size distributions can be modified by sedimentary reworking events (for example, during storms) which tend to winnow/remove the smallest size fraction. Therefore, care must be taken in the selection and analysis of samples.
   In addition to framboids, a large proportion of the sedimentary pyrite in the Jurassic shales consists of microcrystals and amorphous lumps. The varying proportions of these morphologies show only weak correspondence with ORE fluctuations, and their size variations are unrelated, making them unsuitable for determining ancient redox levels. The presence of large amounts of non-framboidal pyrite in black shales will complicate the assessment of whole rock S isotope fluctuations, because each population is likely to have formed at different locations within the sedimentary environment.

AB  - Intercropping combines a commercial crop with a cover crop to reduce pest species abundance and make chemical control less necessary. Although this system has a long tradition, the underlying mechanisms remain partly obscure, in this study, Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea gemmifera L. cv. Kundry F-1) were undersown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. cv. Surprise). Half of the plants were grown in open containers to reduce rhizosphere competition in intercropped plots. The population dynamics of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae L.) were monitored on all plants. Plants inoculated with aphid colonies were transplanted to the field and used to assess the impact of natural enemies in relation to vegetation diversity.
   Intercropping Brussels sprouts significantly reduced densities of cabbage aphids. Winged females mainly colonized plants growing in control plots but also intercropped plants at the border of intercropped plots. Containerization of plants had neither an effect on the population levels nor an effect on the colonization of winged females. Plant quality did not play a crucial role during initial colonization and subsequent population increase. The hoverfly, Episyrphus balteatus DeG., or the parasitoid, Diaeretiella rapae M'Intosh, showed different numerical responses to increased densities of aphids in the two treatments. It is concluded that a complex interaction of several factors, i.e. dispersion, microhabitat condition, or natural enemies, accounts for reduced pest populations over time, at least in the field system tested.

AB  - Thirty-seven coal samples of Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian age from three boreholes in the Saar-Nahe Basin, Germany, have been studied by organic geochemical and coal petrological methods. The investigations were aimed at the recognition of floral changes in the Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian strata. The results show that compositional changes in the extracts are only partly caused by variations in coalification. Specific aromatic hydrocarbons appear in Upper Westphalian D coal seams and increase in concentration up to the Rotliegendes. The dominant compound has been identified by mass spectrometry and NMR-spectroscopy as 5-methyl-1 0-(4-methylpentyl)-des-A-25-norarbora(ferna)-5,7,9-triene (MATH) and always occurs associated with 25-norarbora(ferna)-5,7,9-triene. Both compounds are thought to originate from isoarborinol, fernene-3 beta-ol, or fernenes. The strongly acidic conditions during deposition of the coals might have induced the 4,5-cleavage combined with a methyl-shift in an arborane/fernane-type pentacyclic precursor yielding the MATH.
   Based on petrological investigations, palynomorphs related to early Gymnospermopsida such as Pte- ridospermales and Coniferophytes (Cordaitales and Coniferales) increased in abundance in the strata beginning with the Upper Westphalian D concomitant with the above mentioned biomarkers. The results suggest the arborane/fernane derivatives originate from the plant communities producing these palynomorphs.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to study the combustion characteristics of aromatic-enriched tire pyrolysis oil (TPO) produced from typical small vehicles and truck tires. Pyrolysis oils (NRTO: natural rubber tire oil and SRTO: synthetic rubber tire oil) from two raw radial tire materials were produced and condensed at 25 degrees C and 130 degrees C in a three-stage auger pyrolysis reactor under negative pressure. Combustion particularities were acquired using a single-droplet suspension combustion device and evaluated by five different indicators: kinetics, flame shape, burning rates, flame stand-off ratio (FSR) and mass transfer parameters. It was found that TPO was a potential fuel with higher calorific value (40-44 MJ/kg) and lower combustion apparent activation energy (10-40 MJ/ mol) than that of bio-oil and solid fuels. Oil produced from synthetic rubber and condensed at 25 degrees C exhibited higher stable burning rate (1.93 +/- 0.03 mm2/s) than that of nature rubber pyrolysis oil. Comparing with traditional fuels, tire oil droplets displayed higher surface local heat transfer coefficient, but the mass transfer number (B approximate to 2.5) and FSR (<3.1) under stable combustion conditions were much lower. The combustion behavior of TPO has partial similarity with unsaturated hydrocarbons and ester biofuels. The reported results support the well-characterized TPO condensates for subsequent atomized combustion in realistic industrial burners.

AB  - Purpose Environmental problems such as CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) emissions have seriously affected the development of the steel industry, which has urged the industry to adopt a more effective emission reduction policy. This paper aims to analyze the impact of various CO2 emission reduction policies combinations on the economic benefits and environmental changes of the steel industry and to determine the scope of application. Design/methodology/approach To compare the impact and applicable implementation conditions, a production decision game model that incorporates these two policies has been constructed. Short-, medium- and long-term constraints are set on the emission reduction indicators and the indicators' changes under various scenarios are compared. Findings In the case of a single emission reduction policy, the carbon trading (CT) mechanism is better than the carbon tax mechanism. The mixed carbon trading mechanism is superior to the mixed carbon tax mechanism in terms of total output and subsidies, but worse in terms of overall social welfare, producer surplus and macro losses. Originality/value This paper constructs multiple emission reduction and production backgrounds and discusses the impact of the comprehensive implementation of these policies, which is practically absent in previous studies. It is in line with the current industrial policy for stable production and environmental protection and also provides a reference for the formulation of detailed policies in the future.

AB  - Conflicting research results regarding the application of environmental management systems on the environmental performance of industrial organizations between positive, negative, and no effect made studying this relationship a complex research problem. This study aimed to assess the extent of the commitment of industrial organizations in Saudi Arabia in applying ISO 14031:2013 guidelines to evaluate environmental performance and to study the association between the guideline implementation by ISO 14001:2015 certified and uncertified organizations. Using the descriptive approach, the association was identified between 13 independent variables representing ISO 14031:2013 guidelines for environmental performance evaluation and ISO 14001:2015 certification based on a 596 organizations survey conducted from May to December 2020, in addition to comparing the results of the study with similar studies. The results showed a medium positive correlation of ISO 14031 measurement variables with ISO 14001 certification. The study answered the question concerning the association of implementing of ISO 14031 guidelines to evaluate the environmental performance of ISO 14001 certified or uncertified organizations. Limited resources organizations should focus on monitoring environmental indicators and concentrate of planning activities to ensure the organizations uses environmental condition indicators data efficiently. Future studies are necessary to determine causal relationships, to develop specific environmental performance measures, and to integrate ISO 14031 in ISO 14001.

AB  - Following the failure of the Fundao mine tailings dam in Brazil, approximately 32 million cubic meters of Fe ore tailings were released into the downstream riverine system. The postevent monitoring surveys implemented the use of noninvasive acoustic methods to improve the understanding of the fish biomass distribution patterns and aquatic habitat condition of the impacted reaches of the Rio Gualaxo do Norte, Rio do Carmo, and Rio Doce. The primary focus of the program was to collect hydroacoustic measurements of fish biomass, which was accompanied by sonar imaging of aquatic habitats using high-resolution side scan and downward imaging sonar at each site visited. The biannual surveys began in April 2017 and were fundamentally a multiple control-impact design because before data (prior to the dam failure event) were not available. Up to 22 sites were visited for each survey, including reservoir and river sites. Results indicate similar levels of instream habitat between control and impact river and reservoir sites. Average volumetric biomass was not significantly different between impact sites and their corresponding controls in the August 2018 survey (latest to date). Preliminary temporal analysis of the biomass data set collected indicates that either stable or increasing levels of biomass are detected at tailings impacted sites within the Rio Doce.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-7.

AB  - Children's health, attendance, and academic performance may be affected by school environmental hazards. While prior studies evaluated home environment and health, few have evaluated indicators of school in-/outdoor environment and health. This study addresses this knowledge gap by systematically reviewing and evaluating outdoor and indoor indicators of school environment and student's health and performance in New York State (NYS). We also evaluate statistical methodologies to address highly correlated indicators and integrate multiple exposures. Multiple school environmental indicators were identified from various existing NYS datasets. We summarized data sources, completeness, geographic and temporal coverage, and data quality for each indicator. Each indicator was evaluated by scientific basis/relevance, analytic soundness/feasibility, and interpretation/utility, and validated using objective NYS data. Finally, advanced variable selection methods were described and discussed. We have identified and evaluated multiple school environmental health indicators. It was found that mold and moisture problems, ventilation problems, ambient ozone, and PM2.5 levels are among the top priorities of school environmental issues/indicators in NYS, which were also consistent while using NYS data. Choice of best variable selection method should be made based on the research questions and data characteristics. The school environmental health indicators identified, and variable selection methods evaluated, in this study could be used by other researchers to help school officials and policy makers initiate prevention programs.

KW  - social intelligence
KW  - chemistry learning
AB  - Interpersonal intelligence is social intelligence that shows one's ability to create good relationships with friends or the environment. In fact, this intelligence has not been maximally trained in learning at school, especially in chemistry learning, even though the intelligence is important enough to hone the child's ability to be able to socialize with their environment. The purpose of this study was to identify the real conditions of students' interpersonal intelligence in Pharmacy Vocational High School in the city of Semarang. A survey was performed in the academic year 2018/2019 with a sample of 57 students of class XII Pharmacy Vocational High School in the city of Semarang, Indonesia, who had given their approval as participants. Sampling was done randomly. Data collection techniques were carried out by observation, peer assessment, and self-assessment when applying chemistry learning. The results showed that 56% of students had low interpersonal intelligence based on observations and, according to the results of survey analysis with peer assessment instruments, there were 59% of students also categorized low for this capability. The survey results with self-assessment instruments also showed 56% of students had low interpersonal intelligence. Low intelligence is mainly in the indicators of the ability to ask, answer questions, and provide answers. This fact is relatively similar to the literature, which reveals that 50% of students have interpersonal intelligence with a medium-low category. So the conclusion is that in reality, this intelligence is still low.

AB  - Aromatic hydrocarbons extracted from Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian and Campanian) Latrobe Group coaly shales and shales from the Gippsland Basin were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A variety of 2-ring to 6-ring aromatic hydrocarbons were identified, including both higher-plant-derived and combustion-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These aromatic compounds indicate that the Upper Cretaceous coaly shales and shales were deposited in a fluvial/deltaic environment with significant higher plant input and are at a relatively low thermal maturity stage. Higher plant parameters and angiosperm/gymnosperm indices based on aromatic components suggest that higher land plants, including both angiosperms and gymnosperms, were an important part of the palaeovegetation in the Upper Cretaceous. The aromatic angiosperm/gymnosperm index that includes chrysene- and picene-type PAHs is not as reliable for evaluation of relative angiosperm and gymnosperm contributions as the aliphatic indices due to input of combustion-derived PAHs and the complexity of burning conditions altering the relative contributions. However, combustion-derived PAHs and aromatic angiosperm/gymnosperm indices supplement the information from aliphatic hydrocarbons and provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that palaeoclimate cooled from the Campanian to the Maastrichtian.

AB  - A novel configuration of biomass-based cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system, consisting of Gas Turbine (GT), Supercritical Carbon dioxide cycle (S-CO2) and double effect LiBr-H2O absorption chiller is proposed and its performance is analyzed and compared for two cases: 1) fueling with syngas from the gasification process and 2) fueling with biogas from the digestion process. Thermodynamic models are developed to evaluate the proposed systems' performance from energy, exergy and exergoeconomic viewpoints and an environmental assessment is conducted to evaluate the systems' CO2 emission. Then, a multi-objective optimization is applied for which the exergy efficiency and unit cost of system products are selected as the objective functions. The results revealed that the digestion-based system performs better than the gasification-based one in terms of efficiency, unit product cost and environmental impacts. The former yields a maximum exergy efficiency of 47.8%, while for the latter a maximum efficiency of 42.74% is calculated. For digestion-based system, the values of 47.09% and 5.436 $/GJ are calculated for exergy efficiency and product unit cost at the optimum operating conditions. Also, the results of environmental assessment indicated the values of 2.6x10(-2)t/MWh and 4.21x10(-2)t/MWh for CO2 emissions for digestion- and gasification-based systems, respectively.

AB  - An extensive investigation of a novel thermodynamic trigeneration cycle, operating with two-phase expanders and compressors and single-component wet working fluids, is carried out. Among the available fluids in the commercial software Aspen Plus 9.0 (R) database and commonly used in industrial applications, four chemical species are selected according to several criteria in order to ensure the technical feasibility of the thermodynamic cycle. Using Aspen Plus 9.0 (R), an extensive sensitivity analysis in steady state conditions considering six process parameters is carried out for each selected working fluid. The combined effects associated to the process parameters on several energy performance indicators are described. To this purpose, the Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) and energy performance maps associated to each indicator are adopted in original way. For each working fluid, each PCP allows the selection of the arrays of the process parameters corresponding to high values of the respective indicator. Each energy performance map allows determining the working fluid associated to the respective maximum indicator in function of the temperatures of the trigenerative end-user and external environment. The proposed method of analysis is a useful and new tool for similar investigation associated to a generic thermodynamic cycle. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land-atmosphere interactions play a critical role in the Earth system, and a better understanding of these interactions could improve weather and climate models. The interaction among drought, vegetation productivity, and land cover is of particular significance. In a semiarid environment, such as the U.S. Great Plains, droughts can have a large influence on the productivity of agriculture and grasslands, with serious environmental and economic impacts. Here, we used the vegetation drought response index (VegDRI) drought indicator to investigate the response of vegetation to weather and climate for land-cover types in the Great Plains in the United States from 1989 to 2012. We found that analysis that focused on land-cover types within ecoregion divisions provided substantially more and land-cover-based detail on the timing and intensity of drought than did summarizing across the entire Great Plains region. In the northern Great Plains, VegDRI measured more frequent drought impacts on vegetation in the western ecoregions than in the eastern ecoregions. Across the ecoregions of the Great Plains, drought impacts on vegetation were more commonly found in grassland than in cropland. For example, in the "Northwestern Great Plains" ecoregion (which encompasses areas of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska), grassland and nonirrigated cropland were observed in VegDRI to have historical fractional drought coverages in the growing season of 17% and 11%, respectively.

AB  - The prime requirement for marine water studies is a competent sampling device that can collect water samples perfectly without any contamination to avoid false analysis. The present study demonstrates the design and operation of a cost-effective novel water sampler, which collects contamination-free water from any desired depths of seawater. The sampler is also fitted with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with improved property for concentration of diversified bacteria. To test the efficiency of the designed sampler under field conditions, the differential depth water sampler (DDWS) was deployed at two coastal sampling stations to collect water samples from various depths. The collected water across the water column was then analyzed for bacterial diversity (culturable and functional bacterial diversity), various environmental parameters (pH, TDS, turbidity, density, salinity, inorganic phosphate, BOD, DO, COD, and total nitrogen), zoo, and phytoplankton to confirm the efficacy of the DDWS. The sampler-appended membrane could concentrate diversified bacteria from different seawater depths. Further, the bacterial diversity study, environmental parameters, and zoo and phytoplankton study showed a marked variance across different depths. The results thus obtained supported that the newly designed DDWS could successfully sample contamination-free water from various depths in seawater. The invented water sampler is easy to construct and operate, and the collected contamination-free water volume (3.5 L) suffices the requirement for the analyses of major water parameters entailed for different marine environmental studies.

AB  - The process of methanogenesis, which is in the essence of the widely distributed technologies for biogas production, is slow, has multiple steps and occurs under anaerobic conditions. These factors make the control and the management of the anaerobic digestion difficult and impose the testing and implementation of new indicators for control which are fast and focused on the activity and functioning of the methanogenic community in addition to the traditionally used technological parameters. In this study, the biogas production process in wastewater treatment plant Kubratovo' was analysed in two different seasonal situations and a correlation was made between the studied parameters for control. The complex methodological arsenal included the activities of aerobic and anaerobic dehydrogenase, fluorescent image analysis and key chemical and technological indicators. The correlation analysis showed that the fluorescent image analysis parameters (number/mean size of clusters; fluorescence intensity; area) had the strongest relationship with the biogas production. Based on these results, we propose a fluorescent indicative system for control of the biogas production technologies. It is a fast tool for assessment the effectiveness of the process of anaerobic digestion. Its focus on the activity and functioning of the biological system could contribute to the optimization of the whole performance of these technologies and could serve as a prediction tool for potential problems in the future.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to analyze the suitability of the packaging strategy of an important Spanish agro-food company, regarding to economic and environmental sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach: Three different types of packaging are analyzed to obtain a diagnostic of the initial situation. In this process, cost and carbon footprint are calculated in order to measure the economic and environmental impacts, respectively. Then, a new packaging allocation logic is proposed with the aim of improving both aspects.
   Findings: The results show that the carbon footprint is strongly and positively affected by the cost reduction, showing the viability of a win-win relationship between both aspects.
   Research limitations/implications: The strength of this win-win relationship may be conditioned by the input values considered in this case study. Conversion factors used to calculate carbon footprint vary a lot among researchers, showing the need of standardization in this topic.
   Practical implications: Since the existence of a positive relationship between economic and environmental sustainability has been demonstrated, organizations should find this kind of situations in themselves to satisfy their own stakeholders.
   Originality/value: This article shows the potential of unite waste elimination with eco-friendly activities with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of companies. This paper also contributes to the knowledge of economic and environmental sustainability and reinforces theoretical aspects, paving the way for further research on these topics.

AB  - The Greater One-horned Rhino of India is an endangered species. We investigate the pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs preserved in rhino dung collected from a communal rhino dung midden in Kaziranga National Park to document the vegetation composition and dietary habits of this rhino. The palynodata reflects the dominance of nonarboreals over arboreals from forested and grassland areas respectively. The arboreals include a mixture of evergreen, riparian, and deciduous taxa, which are strongly indicative of different types of forest in the park. The high presence of grass pollen and phytoliths in the rhino dung was marked and confirmed that grass is the primary food of the rhino. Diatoms and Thecamoeba in the rhino dung assemblage was suggestive of the ingestion of huge amount of water and the water logged condition in parts of the park. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis indicated that the silica contained in rhino dung sample was high in comparison to the others elements and determination of its presence is useful for understanding rhinoceros' habits. The generated data will be helpful and to serve as a guideline for subsequent palaeoecological and palaeodietary studies in the park. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drought is one of the major threats to societies in Sub-Saharan Africa, as the majority of the population highly depends on rain-fed subsistence agriculture and traditional water supply systems. Hot-spot areas of potential drought impact need to be identified to reduce risk and adapt a growing population to a changing environment. This paper presents the Blended Drought Index (BDI), an integrated tool for estimating the impact of drought as a climate-induced hazard in the semi-arid Cuvelai-Basin of Angola and Namibia. It incorporates meteorological and agricultural drought characteristics that impair the population's ability to ensure food and water security. The BDI uses a copula function to combine common standardized drought indicators that describe precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and vegetation conditions. Satellite remote sensing products were processed to analyze drought frequency, severity and duration. As the primary result, an integrated drought hazard map was built to spatially depict drought hot-spots. Temporally, the BDI correlates well with millet/sorghum yield (r = 0.51) and local water consumption (r = -0.45) and outperforms conventional indicators. In the light of a drought's multifaceted impact on society, the BDI is a simple and transferable tool to identify areas highly threatened by drought in an integrated manner.

AB  - The promotion of Blue Growth in aquaculture requires an understanding of the economic drivers influencing the sector at farm level, but the collection of reliable and comparable data at this level is time-consuming and expensive. This study suggests an alternative strategy for qualitative sampling of freshwater trout farms in Germany, Denmark and Turkey, using a combination of existing data, group discussions and interviews with trout farmers, consultants and researchers. Nine 'typical' trout farming models are described, focusing on profitability, productivity and energy efficiency and allowing in-depth comparative economic analyses of different production systems at farm level, across regions. Our results show that the majority of the farms investigated have been profitable. Turkish farms benefit from competitive advantages due to low wages, low capital investment and favourable climate conditions. Large German farms profit from local market prices and advanced farm management. Danish farms using recirculating techniques remain competitive thanks to enhanced productivity and economy of scale. However, small traditional farms in Germany and Denmark may struggle to stay competitive in the long term. Organic farms in both countries face challenges of high feed costs and comparatively low productivity with mixed success. Using edible protein energy return on investment (epEROI) as an indicator of ecological sustainability, all surveyed farms compared very favourably with the terrestrial systems of animal meat production were investigated so far.

AB  - Sustainable farming practices are required to address the persistent problems of land degradation and declining crop productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Approaches such as reducing tillage and retaining crop residues as mulch are potential entry points for smallholder farmers to move towards sustainability. In this study, we assessed the impact of reduced tillage (RT) compared with conventional tillage (CT), each combined with crop residue reapplication, on soil quality indicators and crop yields under an 8-year trial in western Kenya. Our results indicate that RT combined with crop residue reapplication enhanced soil physical quality through increased macroaggregate (>2000 mu m) proportions and mean weight diameter. Similarly, lower respiratory quotient values indicate that soil microbes under RT have better substrate-use efficiency than those under CT. Nevertheless, soil organic carbon (C), potentially mineralisable C, microbial biomass C and mineral nitrogen contents were all higher under CT with crop residue incorporated into the soil. Maize grain yield and aboveground biomass were also higher under CT. Thus, despite RT showing potential to improve soil physical properties, CT performed better. A stepwise approach is proposed towards the practice of conservation agriculture under resource-constrained smallholder farming conditions, starting with increased biomass production to provide crop residue for soil cover, followed by RT approaches.

AB  - Food chain modeling is often used to assess the risks of chemical contaminants to wildlife. In modeling efforts, bioaccessibility from different dietary components is assumed to be similar. The present study explored potential differences in the in vitro bioaccessibility of metals from a range of insect orders, which are common components of the diet of insectivorous bats, and assessed the implications of this for environmental exposure assessment. Bioaccessibility of metals was assessed using an in vitro gastric model simulating gastric and intestinal conditions of insectivorous bats. In vitro-derived metal bioaccessibility was found to differ significantly across insect orders. Bioaccessibility was found to be greatest in Coleoptera, followed by Lepidoptera and Diptera. To establish the implications for risk assessment, a spatially explicit risk model was employed that included and excluded in vitro bioaccessibility data; to examine the daily oral exposure of metals to 14 bat species. The results show that when bioaccessibility data are included in the model, metal exposure predictions across species are changed and that the ranking of bat species, in terms of metal exposure, are altered. The authors recommend that in vitro bioaccessibility data begin to be employed when establishing the risks of contaminants to wildlife species. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:898-906. (c) 2014 SETAC

AB  - Regularization methods allow one to handle a variety of inferential problems where there are more covariates than cases. This allows one to consider a potentially enormous number of covariates for a problem. We exploit the power of these techniques, supersaturating models by augmenting the "natural" covariates in the problem with an additional indicator for each case in the data set. We attach a penalty term for these case-specific indicators which is designed to produce a desired effect. For regression methods with squared error loss, an L-1 penalty produces a regression which is robust to outliers and high leverage cases; for quantile regression methods, an l(2) penalty decreases the variance of the fit enough to overcome an increase in bias. The paradigm thus allows us to robustify procedures which lack robustness and to increase the efficiency of procedures which are robust.
   We provide a general framework for the inclusion of case-specific parameters in regularization problems, describing the impact on the effective loss for a variety of regression and classification problems. We outline a computational strategy by which existing software can be modified to solve the augmented regularization problem, providing conditions under which such modification will converge to the optimum solution. We illustrate the benefits of including case-specific parameters in the context of mean regression and quantile regression through analysis of NHANES and linguistic data sets.

AB  - Some of the proxies used to identify palaeotsunamis are reviewed in light of new findings following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2009 South Pacific Tsunami, and a revised toolkit provided. The new application of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) to the study of tsunami deposits and its usefulness to determine the hydrodynamic conditions during the emplacement of tsunami sequences, together with data from grain size analysis, are presented. The value of chemical proxies as indicators of saltwater inundation, associated marine shell and/or coral, high-energy depositional environment, and possible contamination, is demonstrated and issues of preservation addressed. We also provide new findings from detailed studies of heavy minerals.
   New information gathered during the UNESCO - International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) International Tsunami Survey of fine onshore sediments following the 2009 South Pacific Tsunami is presented, and includes grain size, chemical, diatom and foraminifera data. The tsunami deposit varied, ranging from fining-upward sand layers to thin sand layers overlain by a thick layer of organic debris and/or a mud cap. Grain size characteristics, chemical data and microfossil assemblages provide evidence for marine inundation from near shore, and changes in flow dynamics during the tsunami. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Avian plumage colours are some of the most conspicuous sexual ornaments, and yet standardized selection gradients for plumage colour have rarely been quantified. We examined patterns of fecundity selection on plumage colour in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus L.). When not accounting for environmental heterogeneity, we detected relatively few cases of selection. We found significant disruptive selection on adult male crown colour and yearling female chest colour and marginally nonsignificant positive linear selection on adult female crown colour. We discovered no new significant selection gradients with canonical rotation of the matrix of nonlinear selection. Next, using a long-term data set, we identified territory-level environmental variables that predicted fecundity to determine whether these variables influenced patterns of plumage selection. The first of these variables, the density of oaks within 50 m of the nest, influenced selection gradients only for yearling males. The second variable, an inverse function of nesting density, interacted with a subset of plumage selection gradients for yearling males and adult females, although the strength and direction of selection did not vary predictably with population density across these analyses. Overall, fecundity selection on plumage colour in blue tits appeared rare and inconsistent among sexes and age classes.

AB  - Eutrophication is one of the major problems for surface water quality in Norway, particularly in the lowlands near settlements and agricultural areas. Here, we present a new index based on non-diatomaceous benthic algae (Periphyton index of trophic status, PIT) which is developed on a dataset of > 500 samples from > 350 sites from the Norwegian mainland and can be used to describe trophic status at a river site. PIT indicator values for benthic algae taxa are derived from water total phosphorus concentrations and range from 1.87 for Stigonema hormoides to 68.91 for Tribonema sp. PIT site values range from 3.42 to 44.45 and cover a range from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions. The relationship between the PIT and the total phosphorus concentration has one major threshold at 10 mu g/l TP, with a slow increase below and a steep increase above 10 mu g/l. We conclude that benthic algae species composition at nutrient poor sites reacts only slightly to small increases in phosphorus concentration, while it is most sensible to eutrophication in the range between 10 and 30 mu g TP/l. For the genus Oedogonium, we found a significant positive correlation between filament width and TP concentration, making Oedogonium an easy to use eutrophication indicator.

AB  - The freshwater microalga Haematococcus pluvialis exhibits a unique morphological response to environmental stress, accumulating carotenoid pigment during encystment. The complexity of characterizing the different cell stages and monitoring the pigment cell content during the life cycle of this microalga is one of the main problems reported when assessing astaxanthin accumulation and degradation. Therefore, with the aim of studying the potential encystment response in this microalga by means of flow cytometry (FCM), we induced oxidative stress in cultures of vegetative growing cells by treating them with paraquat, a known generator of superoxide anion radicals. Two flow cytometric approaches were successfully used to monitor the effect of oxidative stress on morphological changes and genesis of carotenoids in H. pluvialis: (1) a cytometric characterization of different cell types based on analysis of the fluorescence of chlorophyll a vs the fluorescence of astaxanthin, and (2) staining with the fluorochromes hydroethidium (HE) and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR), in order to measure the invivo intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). FCM data showed that astaxanthin accumulation during encystment hampers the production of ROS. Furthermore, the cell content of astaxanthin seems to be a good indicator of the extent to which H. pluvialis cells undergo oxidative stress, and also of how the cells defend themselves under stress conditions.

AB  - To elucidate broad-scale environmental controls of coniferous forest reproduction in the Sierra Nevada, California, we monitored reproduction for 5 years in 47 plots arrayed across a steep elevational (climatic) gradient. We found that both absolute seedling densities (stems < 1.37 m) and seedling densities relative to overstory parent tree basal area declined sharply with elevation. Rates of seedling turnover (the average of birth and death rates) also declined with elevation. In contrast, seed production was not predicted by elevation and was highly variable from year to year. During a mast year of seed production, the intensity of masting was uneven among plots. Seedling densities were elevated only during the single year immediately following the mast year, suggesting reproduction in our forests may be primarily limited by abiotic factors such as the availability of suitable sites and weather. Disturbance also clearly affected reproduction; plots that had recently burned had significantly higher seedling to parent tree ratios for Abies species, suggesting that even though established Abies concolor may be relatively susceptible to fire, the species can recover rapidly through prolific reproduction. Since reproductive failures may be our earliest signal of changing forest conditions, seedling dynamics could provide a sensitive, if variable, indicator of environmental changes.

AB  - Aims: To isolate and identify dextran-degrading organisms from sugar mill and compost samples, and to examine the diversity of the dextranolytic enzymes produced.
   Methods and Results: Fifteen dextranolytic prokaryotes were purified at various temperatures from sugar-mill or compost samples, using indicator plates containing blue dextran. A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that 12 isolates purified at 40, 50 or 70degreesC were closely aligned to Paenibacillus spp. The three isolates purified at 60degreesC had identical 16S rDNA sequences, with highest affinity to Bacillus spp. Liquid culture of the 11 isolates purified at 40 or 50degreesC produced dextranolytic activity in the spent media with maximal activity at 40 or 45degreesC under the assay conditions used. Hydrolysis of blue dextran in activity gels showed that the 12 Paenibacillus isolates produced from one to five dextranolytic proteins, ranging from 70 to 120 kDa. Based on 16S rDNA sequence, growth habit in liquid culture and dextranolytic enzyme pattern, the 12 Paenibacillus-like isolates could be differentiated into six distinct groups, one of which was capable of growth at 70degreesC.
   Conclusions: The Bacillales, especially the Paenibacillus, are a valuable environmental repository for dextranolytic enzymes of diverse size and potentially diverse activity.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Dextranolytic enzymes produced by Paenibacillus spp. are an exploitable resource for those interested in modifying the structure of dextrans.

AB  - A study was designed to investigate the association between heart rate, respiratory rate and pupil dilation and a subjective pain score allocated using a numerical rating scale (NRS), Four groups of dogs (n = 17 to 20 per group) were included: orthopaedic surgery cases, soft tissue surgery cases, dogs with medical conditions and healthy dogs, Each dog was examined by five veterinary surgeons within a four-hour period, When examining each dog, the observers recorded heart rate, respiratory rate, pupil dilation (present or absent) and a pain score using a NRS (range 0 to 10), For surgical cases, all study assessments were carried out between 21 and 27 hours following the end of surgery, The correlation coefficients between physiological parameters and NRS score were small but, depending on the analysis, were significant for heart rate and NRS score (P < 0.05). However, the size of the coefficient, 0-168, indicated that the relationship was not biologically significant, There was no association between respiratory rate and NRS score, Analysis of the relationship between NRS score and pupil dilation indicated that there was an association between this factor and pain, depending on the analysis. This was significant for the surgical groups (P < 0.05) but not for the other groups, These findings indicate that heart rate and respiratory rate are not useful indicators of pain in hospitalised dogs, It is also unlikely that pupil dilation will be a useful tool in the assessment of pain.

AB  - Compounds of cadmium(II) are well-known human and animal carcinogens. Furthermore, they affect development, growth and brain functions at subacute environmental concentrations in experimental animals. We investigated the potential of cadmium(II) to induce oxidative DNA damage in brain cell cultures obtained from larvae of Pleurodeles waltl. As indicators of DNA lesions typical of oxygen free radicals, we determined the frequencies of DNA strand breaks and of DNA base modifications recognized by the bacterial formamidopyrimidine - DNA glycosylase (Fpg protein). DNA strand breaks were generated in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 1 mu M and greater. In contrast, no significant increase in Fpg-sensitive sites was observed under our experimental conditions. However, the repair of Fpg-sensitive DNA lesions induced by visible light was slightly diminished at 1 mu M and inhibited completely at 10 mu M of cadmium(II), while the closure of DNA strand breaks was not affected. Our results show that, although cadmium is not able to induce oxidative DNA base modifications in larval brain cells directly, its capability to generate DNA strand breaks and to interfere with the repair of oxidative DNA damage could explain the early life stage neurotoxicity of this metal.

AB  - Following the recommendations of SCOPE in 1978, a ten year study of the methodology for background level monitoring has been conducted using a lake remote from human activities as a sampling ''vessel''. The whole study has consisted of: 1. Selection of suitable lakes, 2. Selection of indicator pollutants, 3. Methods for ultra-trace analysis, 4. Examination of the representativeness of lake water samples, 5. Reading the history of pollution contained in the sediments, and 6. Elucidation of changes in loading sources of pollutants. The last subject is not yet completed. This paper focuses mainly on results for subjects 4 and 5. The characteristics of the remote Lake Mashu are discussed from the viewpoint of the effective background monitoring systems with high reliability. The representativeness of the water samples is assured by the hydrological characteristics of the lake and the homogeneity of lake water (caused by mixing). The mechanisms and critical conditions for thorough mixing are estimated. Records of pollution contained in the bottom sediments have been analyzed in conjunction with age data for the sediment layers. Sufficient fundamental information has been accumulated with the results of this study to propose an effective monitoring program for Lake Mashu to be continued for more than 100 years. It was concluded that an international network for monitoring of lakes is advisable.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this paper was to determine motivational factors of structural changes in the agro-industrial sector of Ukraine, which will strengthen the ability of business entities to generate larger added value flows and increase efficiency through the development of strategic network partnerships.
   Methodology / approach. While writing the article the following methods were used: methods of economic and statistical analysis - to study the dynamic of indicators that reflect the results of sectoral structural changes of the enterprises' activities in the sector of agriculture, forestry and fisheries of Ukraine during 2016-2019; critical analysis - to identify shortcomings in the legislative field of Ukraine, which deform motivational vectors, negatively affect the development of agro-industrial complex; morphological analysis and synthesis - to prove the feasibility of interpreting the term "network capital" in a narrow and broad sense; scientific abstraction and graphic visualization - to build the model of formation of network capital and use in the processes of organizational interaction of participants in a strategic business partnership; mathematical modelling - to formalize the conditions under which the network partnership participants will avoid manipulation by the expert environment in the apportionment of the costs and revenues from the implementation of business projects.
   Results. It has been studied the dynamic of indicators that reflect the results of the sectoral and structural changes in activities of Ukrainian enterprises in the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sector during 2016-2019. It has been highlighted shortcomings in the legislative. field of Ukraine, which distort the vectors of motivational influence on the development of agro-industrial complex, causing the corruption schemes spread in the decisions and actions of economic agents. The essential content of the term "network capital" in a narrow and broad interpretation has been differentiated and the motivational basis for its increase by the business network participants has been highlighted. The processes of formation and use of network capital in the inter-organizational interaction of participants of strategic business partnership have been modelled. Nash equilibrium theory has been applied to increase the reliability of the position assessment of business network participants in the total costs and revenues apportionment and it has been proved that this forms the motivational basis for long-term cooperation.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The author's interpretation of the term "network capital" in a broad and narrow sense with emphasis on motivational aspects of this capital increasing in the agro-industrial business network has been proposed. The model of network capital formation and use in the processes of organizational interaction of participants in a strategic business partnership has been constructed. There have been modelled the conditions under which the participants of the network partnership will avoid manipulation by the expert environment in the apportionment processes of costs and revenues from the business projects implementation, which will improve their motivation to cooperate.
   Practical value / implications. The main results of the study can be used for (1) elimination of some gaps in the institutional environment of Ukraine, which distort the motivational vectors of agricultural development; (ii) managing growth processes of network capital to increase the aggregate ability of business network participants to create new consumer value with high added value; (iii) improving the motivational basis for long-term cooperation of business network participants by increasing the reliability of their positions assessment in the total costs and revenues apportionment.

The formulated goal caused assessment of a number of potential factors influencing the development of the export potential of the Ukrainian agro-industrial complex in terms of production and sales of organic agricultural products on foreign markets. The authors conducted economic and mathematical modeling based on the software product E-Views. The observation interval covers 2008-2019. Multifactorial regression model has been constructed and tested for heteroscedasticity, as well as causal relationships have been identified between the main indicators of supply and demand and the exports volumes of related organic products. This makes it possible for further forecast on Ukraine's exports in the short and medium term. Methodology. The study has been based on statistics from international and Ukrainian institutions specializing in organic farming and trade, including FiBL (Research Institute of Organic Agriculture), the Federation of Organic Movement of Ukraine. Databases of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, UNCTAD for the period 2008-2019 were also involved, which made it possible to conduct a full cycle of research procedures in order to identify the most significant factors influencing Ukraine's export activity within related segment of the global market. The results of the conducted modeling show the following: achievement and increase of Ukraine's relative advantage in international trade of organic agro-food products for the outlined years; the existence of strong connection between the volume of exports of organic agro-food products and the level of comparative country's advantages in international trade; identifying a significant impact on exports of endogenous factors, namely the level of wholesale and retail sales on the domestic market of Ukraine as a factor that creates additional demand from the population and business of Ukraine (B2B and B2C markets) for organic products and enhances the attention of agricultural manufacturers to activities that combine the criteria of high profitability and public demand. Another endogenous factor is the volume of areas allocated for organic farming has shown insignificant impact, however, it allows to create resource conditions for increasing production and export activity of national business in a particular sphere on various directions, from meat and dairy products to production of organic fruit, vegetables, etc. Practical implications. Conceptual provisions, conclusions formulated by the authors based on the conducted econometric modeling, allow to optimize the measures of regulatory policy in terms of institutional support of conditions and factors contributing to promising activities of the national agro-industrial complex. This will ensure the implementation of the national strategy on sustainable development with its emphasis achieving environmental criteria of production and consumption, reduce the level of import dependence upon a number of strategically important food groups and, at the same time, increase economic efficiency of Ukrainian agricultural business. Value/originality.
   Prospects for further research in this area may assess the potential of international production and marketing cooperation between Ukrainian agricultural companies and non-resident companies in terms of limiting the latter's access to the land market in Ukraine while finding flexible mechanisms to stimulate joint production and sale of organic agricultural products on international markets according to quality and safety standards.

AB  - The Messinian sequence rocks in the Nile Delta present prolific hydrocarbon reservoirs and are, therefore, of great importance from the aspect of petroleum exploration and development strategies. Yet, little is known about their tectonic provenance and depositional setting. This study focuses on the geochemical signatures archived in the Messinian siliciclastic sediments to employ them as a powerful tool to elucidate the basin evolution during the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC). The pre-MSC Qawasim sediments are texturally and compositionally immature. They are enriched in lithic fragments, foraminiferal bioclasts, and rounded heavy minerals suggesting a significant contribution from the pre-existing Cretaceous-Eocene mixed carbonate-siliciclastic rocks bordering the Nile Delta. In contrast, the textural and mineralogical compositions as well as a range of geochemical proxies (e.g., chemical index of alteration and weathering CIA, CIW as well as index of chemical variability 1CV and Zr/Sc ratio) are in favor of prolonged weathering and at least second-cycle origin of the MSC Abu Madi sediments. The mutually correspondent elemental ratios (e.g., Al2O3/TiO2, K2O/Na2O, Zr/Hf, Rb/Sr, Cr/Zr, and Cr/Th) and uniform weathering trends are indicatives for a similar provenance of the pre-MSC Qawasim and MSC Abu Madi sediments. Rare earth element (REE) distribution reveals a significant enrichment in LREE, depletion in HREE, relatively high (La/Yb)(N) (mean > 9), low (Gd/Yb)(N) (mean < 2) and a pronounced negative Eu anomaly (mean-0.75) in the studied Messinian facies, characteristics of upper continental sources of mainly felsic to intermediate rock affiliations. Provenance proxy ratios (e.g., Al/Ti, La/Sc, Th/Sc, La/Co and Eu/Eu*) along with the low concentration of transition trace elements (Cr, Ni, Co, Ni) are effectively ruling out the contribution from mafic and ultramafic rocks.
   The investigated Messinian sedimentary facies have similar passive margin geotectonic setting and their source rocks were originated in a continental collision tectonic setting that lasted from Late Cretaceous to Oligo-Miocene time. This is confirmed by the Nb/Ta, Zr/Sm ratios coupled with the pronounced Nb, Ta, P, Ti anomalies and enrichments in Pb and U relative to primitive mantle typical of subduction zone environment. The petrographical and geochemical results suggest the MSC Abu Madi sediments to have been eroded and recycled from the older pre-MSC Qawasim sediments by gravity-flow processes and fluvial channels prior to redeposition as incised-valley-fills during the late stage of the MSC. The geochemical paleoenvironmental indicators such as C-value, Sr/Cu and Sr/Ba confirm arid-dry climatic conditions during the onset of the MSC consistent with the Mediterranean desiccation. These indicators also depict a transition from freshwater to relatively normal salinity conditions during the late stage of the MSC. Geochemical results presented in this study support the retrogradational depositional infill of the Messinian incised valleys in the Nile Delta, thus confirming an incipient rise in the Mediterranean Sea level prior to the major Zanclean flooding.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is highly toxic in its methylated form (MeHg), and global change is likely to modify its bioavailability in the environment. However, it is unclear how top predators will be impacted. We studied blood Hg concentrations of chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla (2000-2019) in Svalbard (Norway). From 2000 to 2019, Hg concentrations followed a U-shaped trend. The trophic level, inferred from nitrogen stable isotopes, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations better predicted Hg concentrations, with positive and U-shaped associations, respectively. As strong indicators of primary productivity, Chl a concentrations can influence production of upper trophic levels and, thus, fish community assemblage. In the early 2000s, the high Hg concentrations were likely related to a higher proportion of Arctic prey in kittiwake's diet. The gradual input of Atlantic prey in kittiwake diet could have resulted in a decrease in Hg concentrations until 2013. Then, a new shift in the prey community, added to the shrinking sea ice-associated release of MeHg in the ocean, could explain the increasing trend of Hg observed since 2014. The present monitoring provides critical insights about the exposure of a toxic contaminant in Arctic wildlife, and the reported increase since 2014 raises concern for Arctic seabirds.

AB  - Halophytic vegetation on fossil salt deposits and salt springs is an extreme habitat occurring in isolated continental areas of temperate Europe. It has a relatively rich representation in the Transylvanian Basin of Romania; however, comprehensive research into this highly specialized vegetation is lacking. We provide the first phytosociological survey of recent data of inland salt habitats in Cluj County, where they are widely distributed. Cluster analysis distinguished eight euhalophytic plant communities occupying several zones depending on the micro-topography of the salt-affected area: Scorzonero parviflorae-Juncetum gerardii (including Astero tripolio-Triglochinetum maritime), Plantagineto cornuti-Agrostetum stoloniferae, Artemisio-Festucetum pseudovinae, Artemisio-Petrosimonietum triandrae, Limonio gmelinii-Artemisietum monogynae, Puccinellietum limosae (each allocated to the class Festuco-Puccinellietea), then Suaedetum maritimae and Salicornietum prostratae, belonging to the class Therosalicornietea. We revised the nomenclature of these associations, characterized their species composition and ecological preferences based on indicator values for salinity, pH, moisture and nutrients in the soil. We broadly discussed our findings in light of the historical data and documented the current habitat conditions of the sites. Most of them were found to be degraded due to increasing tourism exploiting the curative effects of salt springs. Beyond recognizing the high conservation value of the Transylvanian salt habitats, it is also important to highlight their biogeographical significance, as they fill the gap between the inland salt marshes of Central Europe and the continental salt habitats of Eurasia.

AB  - In this paper the development and application of an urban building energy simulation model is pre-sented to analyse an existing 5th generation district heating and cooling network (5GDHC) with regard to possible sector coupling potentials. It was evaluated, how the heat energy production through large industrial heat pumps and the total thermal capacities of the 5GDHC network can provide flexibilities for power to heat applications.
   In a first step a multi model dynamic simulation was set up using the simulation environment IDA ICE. A previously developed urban energy simulation model formed the basis to implement the special re-quirements of the investigated 5GDHC network. This was followed by the calibration of the multi model simulation utilising the monitoring data of the existing 5GDHC network. In a second step the flexibilities of network sub areas were systematically investigated using step response tests. This was done with respect to key performance indicators like heat-up time or electrical energy consumption as a function of different boundary conditions like indoor comfort or outdoor air temperature. The third step comprised of a cumulative network analysis using different heating setpoint control strategies to optimise the operation of the network regarding heat production costs.

AB  - Along the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, there are frequent occurrences of strong tectonic movement and large-scale landslides. River blockages often occur in deep-cut river valleys, forming large-scale dammed lakes. In this study, a similar to 26.5 m thick lacustrine sedimentary profile that underlying the modern riverbed of the Yalong River is reported. Here, C-14 dating results show that lacustrine deposition began at similar to 25 ka and continued till similar to 10 ka, mainly during the Last Glacial Maximum. Paleoclimatic indicators, such as particle size, magnetic susceptibility, and spore-pollen combination, were used to reconstruct the evolution process of the paleoenvironment in the study area, revealing that a paleo-flood event occurred at similar to 19 ka.The Tongzilin dammed lake contains an excellent record of the geomorphic evolution of the lower reaches of the Yalong River during the Last Glacial Maximum. Before 25 ka, the Yalong River experienced strong downcutting to form a deep valley, which created the space conditions for the formation of the dammed lake: from 25 to 10 ka, the dammed lake remained relatively stable, with dominating accumulation; and after 10 ka, the dammed lake broke and the river continued to downcut.

There is a need for identifying the specific environments for the selection of adapted and stable genotypes for quality traits in chilli pepper. Among these quality traits, pungency and coloring matter are the most important ones, which need to be in stable amounts in final products. Hence, this multi-environmental evaluation of chilli pepper genotypes was done in three distinct environments, to identify the suitable environments for selection and also suitable genotypes for specific quality traits. The study includes 43 chilli genotypes tested for three distinct growing conditions for nine different quality traits at Punjab Agricultural University and data was analyzed using Eberhart & Russell's model and GGE Biplot analysis. The environmental effect accounts for more than 35% variation for the capsaicin in oleoresin and dry matter content. While the traits namely capsaicin content in red powder (3%) and capsaicin in green chili (4.73%) were least influenced by the environment. The contribution of GxE interactions was < 25% for all the studied traits except ascorbic acid. The genotype AC 101 was best for capsaicin content in green and red chilli powder across the environments. The data generated from this study help to identify the stable and superior genotypes for quality traits in early, main and late-season planting.

AB  - The objective of the study was to compare the effect of calcium peroxide and citric acid on the activity of acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and dehydrogenases (DHA) in uncontaminated soil and soil contaminated with petrol. The experiment was carried out on samples of loamy sand under laboratory conditions. Petrol was introduced to soil samples at a dose of 0 and 50 g.kg 1 DM, as well as calcium peroxide or citric acid at a dose of 0, 50, 100, or 150 mg.kg 1 DM. The humidity of the samples was brought to 60% maximum water holding capacity, and the samples were incubated at 20 degrees C for 8 weeks. Enzyme activity was determined on days 1, 14, 28, and 56. The obtained results demonstrated that the addition of calcium peroxide and citric acid did not result in significant changes in the activity of the determined enzymes in uncontaminated soil. However, it was observed that the application of calcium peroxide, particularly at the dose of 150 mg.kg 1 DM, largely alleviated the impact of petrol on the enzymatic activity of the soil contaminated with petrol. Moreover, among the determined enzymes, the activity of DHA was found to be the best indicator of the effect of calcium peroxide on the soil ecosystem.

In natural ageing conditions, reactive oxygen species accumulates in the seeds that lead to seed deterioration. Wall bound phenolics in seed coat are potential antioxidants that encounter the reactive oxygen species. Four soybean genotypes with different seed coat wall bound phenolics were studied in 2018 at ICAR-Indian Institute of Seed Science and found that the black coat seed such as kalitur and JS76-205 showed highest phenolic content (117.00 and 128.50 mu g/mL) and antioxidant activity of 51.38 and 46.07 mu g eq. ascorbic acid, respectively. On contrary, the harasoya (green coated seed) resulted lowest phenolic content 14.30 mu g/mL, while in RAUS-05 (white coated seed) the antioxidant activity is 2.58 mu g eq. ascorbic acid, which is significantly lower than the other genotypes. Further, the genotypes were evaluated for the seed quality parameters and observed that kalitur and JS76-205 showed higher germination percentage (80%) and vigor indices I (900.33) and II (35.01) than the other genotypes. These results substantiate the hypothesis that the seed coat wall bound phenolics with antioxidant properties could alleviate the reactive oxygen species, protects from mechanical and chemical damage and helps in enhancement of seed quality parameters.

AB  - Hypoxia is a common feature in solid tumors. Clinical samples show a positive correlation between the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 alpha and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and a negative correlation between HIF-1 alpha and hormone sensitivity. Results from monolayer cultures are in contention with clinical observations, showing that ER (+) cell lines no longer express ER alpha under hypoxic conditions (1% O-2). Here, we compared the impact of hypoxia on the ER alpha signaling pathway for T47D cells in a 2D and 3D culture format. In the 2D format, the cells were cultured as monolayers. In the 3D format, paper-based scaffolds supported cells suspended in a collagen matrix. Using ELISA, Western blot, and immunofluorescence measurements, we show that hypoxia differentially regulates ER alpha protein levels in a culture environment-dependent manner. In the 2D format, the protein levels are significantly decreased in hypoxia. In the 3D format, the protein levels are maintained in hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced ER alpha transcriptional activation in both culture formats. These results highlight the importance of considering tissue dimensionality for in vitro studies. They also show that ER alpha protein levels in hypoxia are not an accurate indicator of ER alpha transcriptional activity, and confirm that a positive stain for ER alpha in a clinical sample may not necessarily indicate hormone sensitivity.

AB  - Membrane filtration systems are widely applied for the production of clean drinking water. However, the accumulation of particles on synthetic membranes leads to fouling. Biological fouling (i.e., biofouling) of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes is difficult to control by existing cleaning procedures. Improved strategies are therefore needed. The bacterial diversity on fouled membranes has been studied, especially to identify bacteria with specialized functions and to develop targeted approaches against these microbes. Previous studies have shown that Sphingomonadaceae are initial membrane colonizers that remain dominant while the biofilm develops. Here, we characterized 21 Sphingomonadaceae isolates, obtained from six different fouled membranes, to determine which physiological traits could contribute to colonization of membrane surfaces. Their growth conditions ranged from temperatures between 8 and 42 degrees C, salinity between 0.0 and 5.0% w/v NaCl, pH from 4 and 10, and all isolates were able to metabolize a wide range of substrates. The results presented here show that Sphingomonadaceae membrane isolates share many features that are uncommon for other members of the Sphingomonadaceae family: all membrane isolates are motile and their tolerance for different temperatures, salt concentrations, and pH is high. Although relative abundance is an indicator of fitness for a whole group, for the Sphingomonadaceae it does not reveal the specific physiological traits that are required for membrane colonization. This study, therefore, adds to more fundamental insights in membrane biofouling.

AB  - Sustainability of farms is frequently assessed by developing specific indicators. However, a common choice of indicators is rarely emphasized and it is almost impossible to adopt such indicators due to the different biophysical and geographical conditions of different countries and regions. Similarly, suggesting a common choice of indicators for tea farming appears quite challenging. This study was designed to develop a set of indicators for tea farming by considering the site-specific features. The methodological steps followed in this study were as follows: i) defining a number of possible factors based on the regional characteristics and life patterns of the people, (ii) defining the selection criteria and the validation procedures of the indicators, and (iii) selecting the directly usable indicators from previous farm-level sustainability studies. Self-validation, scientific validation, and social validation were performed. Expert's opinion and stakeholders' participation were found to play a vital role in the validation and selection of the indicators. The data availability and scoring methods were also discussed. As a result, we developed a user-friendly methodology for selecting indicators and scoring methods for the qualitative indicators. The set of indicators identified in this study is totally site-specific. This study proposes a method for a convenient selection of indicators in a region with geographical and climatic diversity.

AB  - Confronted with negative environmental impacts, rising fuel costs and increasing congestion, many cities are implementing sustainable mobility measures to improve the-flow of passenger and goods. Examples of these measures are use of public transport, cycling, walking, energy efficient vehicles, biofuels. The challenge before transport decision makers is which one(s) to choose for implementation as often there is no or limited quantitative data available on the subject. Moreover, the context of each city, its geographic and transport conditions restrict the generalization of results obtained in experienced cities. In this paper, we are investigating application of ideal solution based multicriteria decision making (MCDM) techniques namely fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy VIKOR, and fuzzy GRA for sustainability evaluation of urban mobility projects. A real application for city of Luxembourg is provided. Three projects are evaluated namely implementation of a new tramway in the city center of Luxembourg, re-organization of existing bus lines in the city to perform optimized service, and implementation of electric vehicle car-sharing stations in the city. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the influence of input parameters on modeling results.
   The proposed work is one of the first few works to investigate application of ideal-solution based multicriteria decision making techniques for sustainability evaluation of urban mobility projects under uncertainty. Besides, the best alternative is selected using veto thereby overcoming the limitations of single MCDM methods.

AB  - Many aspects of diet and behaviour can be gleaned from dental wear, including environmental conditions, food-fracture properties, food processing techniques, and cultural habits. Specifically, the angulation (flat vs. steep) of molar wear has been used as an indicator of food toughness and has also been implicated in the use of grinding stones and pottery in food processing. In this work, we focus on the sequential phases of the power stroke of mastication in a functional way, measuring the inclination of molar wear facets through the occlusal fingerprint analysis method. Specifically, we have calculated the angulation of wear facets in upper and lower molars of Palaeolithic humans, extant hunter-gatherers, and proto-farmers to discern differences between groups with different diets. Contrary to previous analyses, our study shows that the molars of Late Pleistocene specimens are characterized by significantly steeper angles than those of modern hunter-gatherers. The flat molar wear found in the latter group could be related to the excessive mixture of exogenous materials accidentally introduced into their foods, as indicated by ethnographic evidence. On the contrary, the steep wear angles characterizing the Palaeolithic group are probably associated with the consumption of a less abrasive diet, which could be ultimately due to food preparation techniques that incorporated less dust and grit into their diets.

AB  - Much evidence exists for sexually selected traits reflecting various components of mate quality, but the factors that limit signal expression and ensure honest signaling are less well known. Predation risk has been proposed to be one factor that could constrain the elaboration of visually conspicuous signals and ensure honesty, but little evidence exists because of limitations of earlier used methods. We investigated using a combination of field observations and experimental work if a conspicuous sexual signal of the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, the red nuptial coloration of the male, increases predation risk. We compared the proportion of colorful males in the gut of a predator in the wild, the perch Perca fluviatilis, to that in the population, and found proportionally more red-colored stickleback in the gut. This indicates that the predator selectively preys on colorful males under natural conditions. To differentiate between the effects of color and behavior on susceptibility to predation, we experimentally investigated the attack behavior of the predator towards breeding stickleback males differing in coloration. We found the predator to preferentially attack more colorful males, independent of their behavior. These results indicate that predation risk is a cost of the sexual signal that could limit expression and influence the honesty of the signal as an indicator of mate quality.

AB  - A large amount of international public and private not-for-profit organizations strives to enhance the conditions of less developed economies under the flagship of sustainability throughout a wide range of infrastructure projects. However, the results are uncertain. Sustainable development in poorer countries requires effective frameworks to ensure the balanced consideration of social, economic and environmental dimensions. This paper discusses the application of the Sustainable Infrastructure Rating System for Developing Countries (SIRSDEC) to a mining infrastructure project located in Peru, in order to validate the methodology developed for this framework. The opinions returned from a questionnaire addressed to international experts according to the pairwise comparison scale of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method were processed to obtain the weights of the elements forming the decision-making tree of SIRSDEC. The Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment (MIVES) was introduced to assess infrastructure projects through the definition of value functions for each sustainability indicator, which enables the integration of variables measured in different units into a standardized value index. The weights obtained for SIRSDEC reflected the balance of the three pillars of sustainability, with a slight predominance of the social dimension. The case study highlighted the contribution of the new system to identify key sustainability issues which were omitted in the original project and posed several actions to improve community's perception and facilitate the development of the project.

AB  - This study examines the habitat preferences of diatom species for bogs, ponds and streams, and explores the effects of environmental variables and substrata on diatom distribution in an alpine basin (Dajiuhu Basin, central China). Ponds and streams were characterized by high pH and high ionic strength, while bogs were acidic and heavy metal-rich habitats. Diatom samples of the epiphyton (attached to Sphagnum), the epipelon (associated with the mud) and the epilithon (attached to stones) were collected from bogs, ponds and streams, respectively. Diatom assemblages in bogs were characterized by acid-tolerant species, such as Eunotia paludosa, Eunotia seminulum and Frustulia rhomboides. In streams, the indicator species preferred circumneutral or alkaline conditions, and included Achnanthidium minutissimum, Nitzschia perminuta and Reimeria sinuata. The characteristic taxa in ponds included Achnanthidium catenatum, Aulacoseira ambigua and Discostella pseudostelligera. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that variations in diatom communities were significantly correlated with two environmental factors (i.e., concentrations of Si and NH4+) and two substratum types (i.e., Sphagnum and stones). Substrata were found to influence diatom composition, probably through mediating the availability of microhabitats, moisture and nutrients. Our results point out the importance of substrata for diatom-based environmental monitoring. This study provides baseline information on diatom communities in the Dajiuhu Basin, for future comparisons, highlighting the utility of diatoms for monitoring environmental change in alpine landscapes.

AB  - Rock glaciers are frozen water reservoirs in mountainous areas. Water resources are important for the local populations and economies. The presence of rock glaciers is commonly used as a direct indicator of mountain permafrost conditions. Over 500 active rock glaciers have been identified, showing that elevations between 3500 and 4500 m asl., a south-facing or east-facing aspect, areas with relatively low solar radiation and low mean annual air temperature (-4 to 0 degrees C) favour the existence of rock glaciers in this region. The permafrost probability model, for Dry Andes of San Juan Province between latitudes 28 degrees 30'S and 32 degrees 30'S, have been analyzed by logistic regression models based on the active rock glaciers occurrence in relation to some topoclimatic variables such as altitude, aspect, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and solar radiation, using optical remote sensing techniques in a GIS environment. The predictive performances of the model have been estimated by known rock glaciers locations and by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). This regional permafrost map can be applied by the Argentinean Government for their recent initiatives which include creating inventories, monitoring and studying ice masses along the Argentinean Andes. Further, this generated map provides valuable input data for permafrost scenarios and contributes to a better understanding of our geosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vulnerability assessments have become necessary to increase the understanding of climate-sensitive systems and inform resource allocation in developing countries. Challenges arise when poor economic and social development combines with heterogeneous climatic conditions. Thus, finding and harmonizing good-quality data at local scale may be a significant hurdle for vulnerability research. In this paper we assess vulnerability to climate change at a local level in Ecuador. We take Ecuador as a case study as socioeconomic data are readily available. To incorporate the spatial and temporal pattern of the climatic variables we use reanalysis datasets and empirical orthogonal functions. Our assessment strategy relies on the statistical behavior of climatic and socioeconomic indicators for the weighting and aggregation mechanism into a composite vulnerability indicator. Rather than assuming equal contribution to the formation of the composite indicator, we assume that the weights of the indicators vary inversely as the variance over the cantons (administrative division of Ecuador). This approach captures the multi-dimensionality of vulnerability in a comprehensive form. We find that the least vulnerable cantons concentrate around Ecuador's largest cities (e.g. Quito and Guayaquil); however, approximately 20 % of the national population lives in other cantons that are categorized as highly and very highly vulnerable to climate change. Results also show that the main determinants of high vulnerability are the lack of land tenure in agricultural areas and the nonexistence of government-funded programs directed to environmental and climate change management.

AB  - Many previous studies focused on the removal capability for contaminants when the algae grown in an unexposed, unpolluted environment and ignored whether the feedback of algae to the toxic stress influenced the removal capability in a subsequent treatment batch. The present research investigated and compared algal feedback and removal efficiency in a sequencing batch reactor algae process (SBAR) to remove cefradine. Three varied pollution load conditions (10, 30 and 60 mg/L) were considered. Compared with the algal characteristics in the first treatment batch at 10 and 30 mg/L, higher algal growth inhibition rates were observed in the second treatment batch (11.23% to 20.81%). In contrast, algae produced more photosynthetic pigments in response to cefradine in the second treatment batch. A better removal efficiency (76.02%) was obtained during 96 h when the alga treated the antibiotic at 60 mg/L in the first treatment batch and at 30 mg/L in the second treatment batch. Additionally, the removal rate per unit algal density was also improved when the alga treated the antibiotic at 30 or 60 mg/L in the first treatment batch, respectively and at 30 mg/L in the second treatment batch. Our result indicated that the green algae were also able to adapt to varied pollution loads in different treatment batches.

AB  - Reference criteria are needed for wetland monitoring and assessment programs. We used field-collected vegetation data from non-forested wetland sites in the south-central United States to establish preliminary criteria for identifying reference-quality wetlands in future surveys. Our analysis included three parts: (1) preliminary reference verification and metric ranking using boxplots and standardized effect size, (2) updating the putative reference sample and metric selection using Test Site Analysis, and (3) establishing reference criteria from best-metric confidence intervals and indicator species combinations. The Floristic Quality Assessment Index most clearly distinguished the reference wetlands; an index value of at least 20 is recommended for future reference designations in the study region. Other potential reference criteria include a maximum of 3-5 % bare ground in the 100 m buffer, a moderately sensitive species assemblage (mean conservatism > 5.0), a small percentage (< 10 %) of tolerant species (coefficient of conservatism a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 2), and high native richness (> 22 species). Five single species, four pairs, and one triplet combination were extracted as potential indicators of reference sites from 70,375 combinations of 75 candidate species, offering an efficient alternative to sampling entire vegetation communities. The analysis framework in this case study could be useful for similar projects in other regions.

AB  - Biofilters are widely adopted in Australia for stormwater treatment, but the reported removal of common faecal indicators (such as Escherichia coli (E. coli)) varies from net removal to net leaching. Currently, the underlying mechanisms that govern the faecal microbial removal in the biofilters are poorly understood. Therefore, it is important to study retention and subsequent survival of faecal microorganisms in the biofilters under different biofilter designs and operational characteristics. The current study investigates how E. coli survival is influenced by temperature, moisture content, sunlight exposure and presence of other microorganisms in filter media and top surface sediment. Soil samples were taken from two different biofilters to investigate E. coli survival under controlled laboratory conditions. Results revealed that the presence of other microorganisms and temperature are vital stressors which govern the survival of E. coli captured either in the top surface sediment or filter media, while sunlight exposure and moisture content are important for the survival of E. coli captured in the top surface sediment compared to that of the filter media. Moreover, increased survival was found in the filter media compared to the top sediment, and sand filter media was found be more hostile than loamy sand filter media towards E. coli survival. Results also suggest that the contribution from the tested environmental stressors on E. coli survival in biofilters will be greatly affected by the seasonality and may vary from one site to another.

AB  - Soil moisture is considered a key index of agricultural drought monitoring systems due to its importance for plant growth and biological interactions. In this research, a Soil Wetness Deficit Index (SWDI) was developed based on a Soil Wetness Index to evaluate soil moisture deviation as an indicator of agricultural drought. The Soil Wetness Index is derived using a triangle space concept between the land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation index (NDVI). To acquire the triangle space concept, 8-day-products of land surface reflectance and LST derived from MODIS satellite data over Isfahan were used. The data was collected in the period of 2000-01 (dry year) and 2004-05 (wet year) on an 8-day time step. The results indicated that the SWDI index has the capability of mapping the spatial distribution of areas affected by drought, as well as the drought intensity. The estimated cumulative number of dry days (with -4 < SWDI < 0) in the period of 2000-01 was 184 days. The results also confirmed the existence of wet days in the period 2004-05. Moreover, shifts in drought condition at the end of the wet and dry periods were detected in the area. Results also showed that the presence of vegetation plays an important role in balancing soil moisture variation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pseudoalteromonas piscicida strain O-7 (formerly Alteromonas sp. strain O-7) is an efficient degrader of chitin in the marine environment. The chitinolytic system of the strain consists of many enzymes induced by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). This paper reports that CdsR, which is a response regulator of CdsS/CdsR two-component signal transduction system, is bound to near the promoter region of GlcNAc-induced aprIV gene. The CdsR protein as a response regulator was transphosphorylated by the CdsS protein as a sensor kinase. Furthermore, the transphosphorylation from CdsS to CdsR was promoted by chitin degradation products and a metabolite. The CdsR protein was also phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate which is an indicator of nutritive conditions of cells. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that phosphorylated CdsR (CdsR-P) was bound to not only near the promoter region of aprIV gene but also those of chiA, chiB, chiC, chiD and cbp1 genes which are induced in the presence of GlcNAc. Footprinting analysis demonstrated that CdsR-P was bound to the sequences around the transcriptional start sites of aprIV and chiD genes. These results indicate that CdsR is one of the common regulators of these genes involved in chitin degradation of the strain.

AB  - Pythium and Phytophthora species are associated with damping-off diseases in vegetable nurseries and reduce seedling stand and yield. In this study, bacterial isolates were selected on the basis of in vitro antagonism potential to inhibit mycelial growth of damping-off pathogens along with plant growth properties for field assessment in wet and winter seasons. We demonstrate efficacy of bacterial isolates to protect chile and tomato plants under natural vegetable nursery and artificially created pathogen-infested (Pythium and Phytophthora spp.) nursery conditions. After 21 days of sowing, chile and tomato plants were harvested and analysed for peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activities. Pseudomonas sp. strains FQP PB-3, FQA PB-3 and GRP(3) were most effective in increasing shoot length (P > 0.05%) in both artificial and natural field sites. For example, Pseudomonas sp. FQA PB-3 treatment increased shoot length by 40% in the artificial Pythium 4746 infested nursery site in chile plants in the wet season. The bacterial treatments significantly increased the activity of peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in chile and tomato plant tissues, which are well known as indicators of an active lignification process. Thus, we conclude that treatment with potential bacterial plant growth promoting agents help plants against pathogen invasion by modulating plant peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activities.

AB  - Questions: What is the best grassland management regime for the threatened plant species Gladiolus imbricatus; is the stage structure of local populations a feasible indicator of the effect of changed management.
   Location: Coastal meadow system in southwestern Estonia.
   Methods: The effect of five management regimes was studied in a long-term (three-year) field experiment: (1) mowing in late July, (2) grazing by cattle, (3) grazing by sheep, (4) sheep Grazina during the first year and mowing during subsequent years, (5) no management (control).
   Results: The population density increased significantly in response to the mowing treatment and to the mowing after sheep grazing treatment. The proportion of grazed plant individuals was higher in the sheep-grazed than in the cattle-grazed treatment. Generative and vegetative adult individuals of G. imbricatus were significantly more damaged by cattle herbivory than juveniles. Al I management regimes shifted the population structure towards a dynamic state where juvenile stages dominate. while the not managed control retained a regressive population structure.
   Conclusions: Population stage structure was a useful indicator of different management conditions, even in the case where population density did not differ. As indicated by population stage structure. the best management regime for G. imbricatus was either mowing in late July only, or alternation of grazing and mowing in different years.

AB  - The "Nubian Series" of Jordan have been a common subject of sedimentologic research to the authors through two decades. The 1700 m thick Early Paleozoic Systems (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian) to be dealt in this paper were deposited at the northern rim of the Arabian Shield (Gondwana). From time to time, the Tethyan Sea invaded onto this stable shelf platform and left more or less reliable time markers intercalating with thick clastic series that prograded from south and southeast.
   Systematic facies analysis (lithofacies, architectural elements) and trace fossil studies (mainly Cruziana) were conducted along fifty profiles. They allowed the identification of a broad variety of sedimentary environments and bathymetric undulations during the interplay of transgression and regression, from offshore to supratidal conditions. The most important transgressions occurred in the Llanvirnian and at the Silurian base.
   Granulometric data and the variations of the mineral content confirm, in addition, the type of sedimentary environments. Gamma ray logs underline the applicability of Critziana-bearing pelites as ingressive indicators. Since regional tectonic events are seen as subordinate, the sedimentologic processes are to be interpreted as of mainly global eustatic interplay. Thereby it becomes evident that the "Maximum Flooding Surface" (after Galloway 1989) is to be preferred versus the classic "Erosive Unconformity" (after Vail et al. 1977) at the edge of a craton.

AB  - Seasonal variation in hydrographic conditions in Taiwan Strait is strongly influenced by the monsoonal system. During northern winter, the China Coastal Current, pushed by the north-east (NE) monsoon, moves southwards into Taiwan Strait and during northern summer, the South China Sea Surface Current, driven by the south-west (SW) monsoon, invades the strait until the NE monsoon again prevails. As the SW monsoon wanes (in northern autumn), the Kuroshio Branch Current enters from the southern part of the strait, but stagnates in the middle because of interference by the China Coastal Current. As the NW monsoon wanes (in northern spring), the stagnation ceases and the SW monsoon begins. We characterised zooplankton (including copepods and ichthyoplankton) communities during a period when the SW monsoon was prevalent (in August), at the onset of the NE monsoon (in November) and as the NE monsoon waned (in March). Multivariate analyses of zooplankton composition and species abundances demonstrated that the structures of communities are closely related to oceanic variables (such as temperature, salinity and upwelling), which, in turn, are heavily influenced by the monsoons. The zooplankton faunas in Taiwan Strait are a mixture of local species and intruding species, the latter introduced from along the China coast during northern winter and from the South China Sea during northern summer. Our findings are fundamental to practical ecosystem management and an effective long-term monitoring programme.

AB  - Escherichia coli, a fecal coliform, and total coliforms were monitored between September 1999 and October 2001 in five marinas at Lake Texoma, located on the Oklahoma and Texas border. The general trend was that densities of E. coli were lower in the summer season due to the lower loading of fecal material into Lake Texoma and the ecological conditions of the lake, such as more vigorous grazing by protozoa and less viability of E. coli at an elevated temperature. The densities of total coliforms greatly increased in the summer. E. coli levels increased with depth, and the bottom water samples had higher densities of E. coli mainly due to their association with particles. There was a direct relationship between amount of gasoline sold, which was related to recreational boating activity, and the resuspension of E. coli. This indicated that recreational boating activity in lake marinas may have resuspended bottom sediments with bound E. coli, and the presence of E. coli in marinas was not an indication of recent fecal contamination. E. coli were detected in the largest densities at the boat dock points, followed by the gasoline filling station, and marina entrance. In addition, enumeration of bacteria in bottom sediment showed that the densities of E. coli and total coliforms in sediment were much higher compared to those in lake water.

AB  - The utility of splenic macrophage aggregates (MAs) as an indicator of fish exposure to degraded environments was evaluated in several species of estuarine fishes as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program-Estuaries (EMAP-E). Using image analysis, we measured the number and mean size of MAs per square millimeter on tissue sections of spleen from 983 fishes representing seven species from 266 stations scattered across coastal estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico. At 16 stations, at least one fish exhibited a high density of MAs (> 40 MAs/mm(2)). Densities of MAs that exceeded 40/mm(2) correlated with exposure to either hypoxic conditions or sediment contamination. Fisher's exact test showed that the observed frequencies of joint occurrence between high numbers of MAs and both high sediment contaminants and low dissolved oxygen were significantly greater than the expected background frequencies. For all 16 sites where MAs were greater than 40/mm(2), sediments displayed at least one contaminant at a concentration in the highest 5% of those observed for all Gulf of Mexico stations. Additionally, comparison of subjective visual analyses with the image analysis measurements showed a strong correlation, indicating that similar analyses can be performed without computer image analysis. This study demonstrates that splenic MAs are effective biotic indicators for discriminating between fish exposed to degraded and nondegraded environments.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH

KW  - UNITED-STATES
AB  - This article explores the strategic importance of information systems for social control of networked services on urban and regional scales, and the nature of the information required for that purpose. The standard indicators of infrastructure coverage - by and large based on the number and encompassment of connections - no longer respond to the real conditions of supply and consumption. The technological and managerial innovations in flow control and dispatch, along with the effects of combined access to multi-mode networks, render the evaluation of services' connectivity considerably more complex than it used to be in the past. Private domination over the supply structure of these services tends to make the political struggle for equitability more dependent on the technical reliability of information than it could have been under the model of state supply. Networked services' management has evolved to a more demand-oriented structure, but this structure has so far reproduced the structural inequalities of Brazilian society in favor of powerful stakeholders, e.g. large consumers. The potential for more democratic control associated with this new balance between supply and demand in networked services can only evolve if more vulnerable social groups have access to sound technological and managerial information. To support this idea the article shows the importance of connectivity indicators in determining the effective access to networked utilities in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo, in contrast to the traditional indicators of services' coverage.

AB  - In schizophrenics cardiovascular autonomic reactivity (CAR) can be used as an indicator of autonomic arousal, Using a standardized autonomic test battery (modified according to Ewing and Clarke) we prospectively compared the CAR between 46 actually ill schizophrenics (diagnosis according to DSM-III-R) treated with either haloperidol (n = 26) or clozapine (n = 20) and 30 well-matched healthy volunteers. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant effect of neuroleptic medication (haloperidol vs. clozapine) on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure under resting conditions as well as on the heart rate variance (30:15 ratio, deep-breathing, Valsalva) and blood pressure tests (sustained handgrip, Schellong). In addition a positive treatment response (using predefined outcome criteria of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) was independently associated with lower resting heart rates and less impaired 30:15 ratios under neuroleptic medication, Our data indicate that clozapine treatment was associated with a substantial impairment of CAR, which can be explained by the drug's anticholinergic properties in combination with an increase in norepinephrine outflow, The greater heart rate variability in responders might be due to an early neuroleptic-induced decrease of sympathetic activity in the autonomic nervous system, which may precede clinical improvement. Our findings are discussed in relation to neuroleptic-induced changes in plasma catecholamine levels suggested to be useful biological markers in predicting treatment outcome.

AB  - Specific and sensitive detection of indigenous and introduced degradative organisms is an essential prerequisite to their use in remediation of toxic waste and soil systems.  Procedures were employed for the use of polymerase chain reaction and gene probes for sensitive detection of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic-acid-degrading bacterium, Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134(pJP4).  Two 20-mer oligonucleotide primers were identified for amplification of a 205-bp region of the tfdB gene of pJP4, and optimum conditions for amplification were determined.  Both the polymerase chain reaction amplification process and hybridization with the 5'-end-labelled probe were found to be specific to organisms containing plasmid pJP4 or its derivative pRO103.  Detection limits were determined for the template supplied either as bacterial cells or purified plasmid DNA.  The detection was sensitive up to an initial inoculum of 3,000 CFU or 156 pg of total plasmid DNA.  However, when the amplified product was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with the 5'-end-labelled probe, the detection sensitivity increased to 300 CFU or 15.6 pg of plasmid DNA.  This sensitive detection method is more specific than use of traditional indicator media (M. A. Loos, Can. J. Microbiol.  21:104-107, 1975).  An oligonucleotide (20 bases) complementary to a sequence internal to the 205-bp region was synthesized and utilized as a probe to confirm the specificity of the detection.

AB  - Manipulator control and planning for complex systems has become a fantasizing concept for the current age robotics bases technological era. The manipulator motion control and planning deals with various challenges of obstacle avoidance and complex environmental conditions which are dealt in this article. This paper addresses the crucial challenges of the current manipulator planning approaches by utilizing the concept of deep learning. A dynamic deep neural network enabled iterative manipulator motion planning framework for complex systems is proposed in this article to deal with the task specific manipulators. The proposed methodology includes three basic modules: a dynamic deep neural network module for input modelling, an iterative trajectory planning and propagation module and a manipulator control and planning module for complex systems. The presented model learns from training and predicts the robot configuration path by generating the feasible task-specific trajectories. The model testing is done on a large dataset including multiple working environments and different manipulator planning problems. The results of the proposed framework are evaluated for different performance indicators and a success rate of 95.19% is achieved consistently with respective minimized error rate of 0.213. The proposed deep learning-based methodology not only make the manipulator learning task specific, but it generalizes the manipulator planning for complex systems, making it more optimal and efficient. The proposed framework when tested over different environments while upholding the computational gains.

AB  - The melanomacrophage centers (MMCs) in the liver of fish are indicators of environmental conditions, as they are involved in xenobiotic biotransformation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the number of MMC in the liver of juveniles and adults of Sciades herzbergii from areas with different levels of contamination. The fish were caught at three points (reference -A1, potentially impacted -A2 and contaminated -A3), in Sao Jose bay (Maranhao, Brazil), in four samples. The livers were subjected to the standard histological procedure and 5 mu m sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In livers of A2 adult individuals (260.50 +/- 161.50 MMCs / mm(2)) they presented a greater number of MMCs when compared to A3 adults (60.00 +/- 30.10 MMCs / mm(2)). Juveniles showed considerable values in A1 (100.00 +/- 0.00 MMCs/mm(2)) and A2 (95.33 +/- 33.00 MMCs / mm(2)) compared to juveniles in A3 (49.00 +/- 0.00 MMCs/mm(2)). These high values are unexpected for young people. The average number of MMC correlated with the rainy season in the region. The use of hepatic MMCs as a biomarker of exposure to pollutants, in particular substances from fisheries systems, such as ammonia and nitrite, proved to be adequate to differentiate areas with different levels of impacts.

AB  - The terms "hotspots," "blackspot," or "high-risk" are normally used for an area on a road where the number of car accidents are far beyond the normal level and, more importantly, the causes of the incident always link to one or many specific reasons. Identifying these spots is helpful and may assist people in authority to implement corrective actions. To do the aforementioned, some decision-support tools could be useful since they enable us to monitor the indicators that may lead to a car accident, same as the procedure engineers use to control production lines in factories. In this regard, control charts are utilized to identify blackspots. Although the method is low cost, and provides quick detection and statistical reliability level and, more importantly, uses online applications; however, it advised that the rate quality control method could be used on roads with the same geometry and traffic conditions. This research develops a hybrid method, based on accident type, for improving rate quality control method to overcome the shortcomings. Furthermore, the suggested framework considers crash severity and traffic volume that have not been taken into account in the rate quality control method yet. The case study evaluates how this framework is successful to identify blackspots, and based on the result in the real environment, it reveals that the proposed method could detect and identify the hotspots.

AB  - Leaves play an important role in plant growth and development through photosynthesis and transpiration. Many studies have explored the effects of short-term drought stress on leaf water status; however, few studies have focused on the leaf water content capacity as an indicator of soil-plant water status during prolonged droughts. The results of a field experiment with various irrigation regimes that was conducted during two consecutive maize growing seasons from 2013 to 2014, indicated that the water content of the first fully expanded leaf (LWCtop1) was representative of the soil-plant water status with the development of drought. LWCtop1 was closely linked to the water condition of other leaves and different plant parts in response to progressive water stress. LWCtop1 shared a quadratic relationship with the photosynthetic rate (P-n), and P-n peaked when LWCtop1 approached 84.11% and decreased to zero when LWCtop1 dropped to 68.26%. Moreover, three stages (slow-fast-slow) were observed as leaf water content responded to soil drying, and two important threshold values (minimum: 70.86 +/- 0.80%, maximum: 84.58 +/- 1.10%) of the leaf water content were determined. The results of this study may provide a physiological and ecological basis for the identification and monitoring of crop drought.

AB  - The development of marine fish farming on the Algerian coast is facing a number of environmental and logistical constraints. In a multi-disciplinary approach, based on aquaculture activity planning and field validation, the aim of this study is to target suitable areas for the setting of floating cages forSparus auratabreeding at the Bay of Souahlia, Algeria. Multi-criteria evaluation via GIS was applied, combining 3 sub-models (environmental, socioeconomic, and constraint sub-models). The field verification was carried out onEl Mokretar Aquafarm, by comparing its position with the result of the multi-criteria evaluation and by studying the growth performance indicators, thermal unit growth coefficient, specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratio and biomass. The regeneration of the final suitability map allowed for the delimitation of the favorable area for the implantation of the floating cages, which corresponds to 32% of the total area, with 3 classes of suitability. TheEl Mokretar Aquafarm is located at station S11, with a significant relevance index of 0.69. The gilthead seabream reflects a good growth performance. It grows with an average weight of 5 to 305 g over a 306-day rearing period, due to the environmental conditions and the good management of the farm.

AB  - After laying their eggs and refilling the egg chamber, sea turtles scatter sand extensively around the nest site. This is presumed to camouflage the nest, or optimize local conditions for egg development, but a consensus on its function is lacking. We quantified activity and mapped the movements of hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles during sand-scattering. For leatherbacks, we also recorded activity at each sand-scattering position. For hawksbills, we recorded breathing rates during nesting as an indicator of metabolic investment and compared with published values for leatherbacks. Temporal and inferred metabolic investment in sand-scattering was substantial for both species. Neither species remained near the nest while sand-scattering, instead moving to several other positions to scatter sand, changing direction each time, progressively displacing themselves from the nest site. Movement patterns were highly diverse between individuals, but activity at each sand-scattering position changed little between completion of egg chamber refilling and return to the sea. Our findings are inconsistent with sand-scattering being to directly camouflage the nest, or primarily for modifying the nest-proximal environment. Instead, they are consistent with the construction of a series of dispersed decoy nests that may reduce the discovery of nests by predators.

AB  - In modern aquaculture, simple and rapid methods of predicting fish ovulation are needed to produce seedlings in a stable and efficient manner. Ovulation time is variable due to environmental and physiological factors, while 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP), an indicator of ovulation, increases its concentration rapidly just before spawning. In this paper, we developed a biosensor system in which immune and enzymatic reaction assays were combined to monitor DHP levels with low environmental loads. We attempted to quantify DHP by analyzing the decrease rate in the output current after the immunoreaction using the amperometric method as a transfer inhibition degree of the enzyme-generated electrons generated by the formation of the antigen-antibody complex. DHP standard samples were measured under investigated optimal conditions and a specific response with a good linear correlation was obtained between the current decrease rate of the sensor system and the DHP concentration in a range of 7.81 similar to 500 pg ml(-1). Further, DHP levels in goldfish (Carassius auratus) during the ovulation period obtained using the sensor system were compared with those of using the conventional method (ELISA) and a good correlation was obtained. These findings suggest that the proposed sensor system can detect DHP quickly and easily compared with the conventional method.

AB  - Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present work intended to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall, this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations. Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption responsible for the effects observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants that are subject to insect herbivory emit a blend of so-called herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), of which only a few serve as cues for the carnivorous enemies to locate their host. We lack understanding which HIPVs are reliable indicators of insect herbivory. Here, we take a modelling approach to elucidate which physicochemical and physiological properties contribute to the information value of a HIPV. A leaf-level HIPV synthesis and emission model is developed and parameterized to poplar. Next, HIPV concentrations within the canopy are inferred as a function of dispersion, transport and chemical degradation of the compounds. We show that the ability of HIPVs to reveal herbivory varies from almost perfect to no better than chance and interacts with canopy conditions. Model predictions matched well with leaf-emission measurements and field and laboratory assays. The chemical class a compound belongs to predicted the signalling ability of a compound only to a minor extent, whereas compound characteristics such as its reaction rate with atmospheric oxidants, biosynthesis rate upon herbivory and volatility were much more important predictors. This study shows the power of merging fields of plant-insect interactions and atmospheric chemistry research to increase our understanding of the ecological significance of HIPVs.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the performance of fungicides against wheat head blast (WHB) under various environments and to determine scenarios best suited for fungicide applications. Field experiments were conducted at 23 environments in Brazil and Bolivia from 2012 to 2015. Data from all trials within the same country were combined for estimating mean WHB control efficacy and yield benefits from using a set of fungicides. Experiments were classified, based on disease index in the check treatment, as having low (CDI=10), moderate (CDI=40), and high (CDI=70) disease pressure and this variable was tested as a covariate in the model. In Brazil, greater disease reduction and yield increase, in trials with moderate to high disease pressure, were obtained when using mancozeb-based fungicides, but with yield gains below 1276kg/ha. In Bolivia, all fungicides reduced the disease at moderate to high disease pressure, but specific QoI+DMI premixes led to higher yield gains averaging 1834kg/ha. Based on the evidence provided, we concluded that current WHB chemical strategies could have radically different results depending on country and disease pressure. Although WHB chemical control can be effective even under environmental conditions that favor the disease, integrated management strategies should be explored. Our results are useful for aiding decisions on fungicide application and identifying priorities for future research.

AB  - This study aimed to establish the mass cultivation of Wolffia brasiliensis under laboratory conditions, determine the sensitivity of reference substances (potassium dichromate, sodium chloride, and potassium chloride), and estimate the acute toxicity (LC50;7d) for the herbicide glyphosate, diquat, paraquat, imazapyr, 2,4-D, saflufenacil, imazamox, penoxsulam, metsulfuron-methyl, and atrazine. Three media were tested for culture establishment: Hoagland's medium, 5.0 g L-1 NPK fertilizer (20-5-20), a mixture of Oxisol + organic substrate of decaying aquatic plant (2:1; v v(-1)). Sensitivity tests with reference substances and acute toxicity for herbicides were carried out after establishing the cultivation. The species W. brasiliensis presented an excellent sensitivity response to reference substances, with means of LC50;7d of 15.61 +/- 2.13 g L-1, 17.02 +/- 0.50 g L-1, and 52.54 +/- 4.27 mg L-1 for sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and potassium dichromate, respectively. The acute toxicity response indicated that W brasiliensis was extremely sensitive to diquat (LC50;7d = 0.07 mg L-1) and paraquat (LC50;7d < 0.05 mg L-1), sensitive to imaapyr (LC50;7d = 21.10 mg L-1), and little sensitive to the other herbicides. The response capacity for the different groups of herbicides, the standardized response to reference substances, and ease of cultivation in the laboratory indicate the potential for using this aquatic plant in the assessment of herbicide risk in aquatic environments.

AB  - As China's high-speed railway featured by low-carbon quick prospers rapidly, railway transport has been regarded as a crucial means to replace the aviation transport. Selecting the data from 156 routes of China's 48 major cities from 2001 to 2014, the paper takes the aviation mileage as the threshold variable and the operation time as the control variable to build a panel threshold regression model. Firstly, under the consideration of the economic, demographic, environmental and railway indicators, the paper analyzes the influence of China's railway on the aviation passenger volume and the flight number; secondly, under the condition that the railway speed is more than 250 km/h, the paper analyzes the shock effect of China's high-speed railway on aviation transport. The conclusion shows that the higher the level of the economic development is, the more developed the aviation transport of the region will be. when the aviation mileage is below 1132 km, as the aviation mileage increases, the influence of China's railway to the aviation transport fall into a decline; China's high-speed railway has a positive shock effect on the aviation transport, and the shock effect reaches the maximum when the aviation mileage is from 650 to 755 km. This paper is of great practical significance to study the optimization of transportation structure.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of foliar fertilizer treatment on the productivity of common wheat. The field experiment was conducted in 2014-2016, in the conditions of meadow-cinnamon soil. One-factor dispersion analysis was performed; variants were evaluated by the Duncan test for multi-directional comparison. From the one-factor dispersion analysis carried out on the main biometric parameters and subsequent comparative analysis on Duncan, it is proved that the height of the plant is statistically very well documented. An additional Duncan test allows grouping of variants. The "length of the spike" of both varieties is distinguished as moderately high The variation follows a trend for both varieties. In the first year, the coefficient of variation in Apolon and Bologna was 14.29% and 15.59% respectively, for the second one was 4.45% and 5.64% and for the last 5.53% and 5.17% respectively. Correlations between the quantitative indicators for the two varieties of common wheat have been established. There is a high, statistically proven correlation between the indicators: "length of the spike" (x(2)), "number of spikelets per spike" (x(3)) and "weight of grains per spike" (x(4)). The results of the correlation analysis are in line with the conclusions drawn from the analysis of applied irrigation regimes and their impact on plants from a biological point of view.

AB  - The article discusses the conflict around the construction of the Rogun HEPS. On the one hand, for Tajikistan, the hydropower plans can solve the actual problem of energy deficit, on the other - for Uzbekistan and neighboring states - this is a threat of environmental and social problems. The purpose of the study is a conflict analysis and justification for the implementation of the project for the commissioning of the Rogun HEPS by Tajikistan to December 2018, as a result of which the significance of the probability of this event is determined. A meaningful model of the situation includes object, subjects, their interests, the chronology of the conflict. Also it was used the expert method of Analytic Network Process (ANP) Thomas L. Saaty with the help of proprietary software Super Decisions. In order to describe advantages and disadvantages of the decision, experts created hierarchies of Benefits, Opportunities, Costs and Risks with the same alternatives. As a result, the probability of the project implementation at the planned time was very high. So, the construction of the hydroelectric power station is positive for the economy, policy and social sphere, and it is associated with the least risks. However, changing the regional and international conditions can change the ratio not in favor of construction, which requires additional research. The analytical tools presented in the article can be an effective tool in the expert forecasts.

AB  - Thermal transmittance or U-value is an indicator of the building envelope thermal properties and a key parameter for evaluation of heat losses through the building elements due to heat transmission. It can be determined by calculation based on thermal characteristics of the building element layers. However, this value does not take into account the effects of irregularities and degradation of certain elements of the envelope caused by aging, which may lead to errors in calculation of the heat losses. An effective and simple method for determination of thermal transmittance is in situ measurement, which is governed by the ISO 9869-1:2014 that defines heat flow meter method. This relatively expensive method leaves marks and damages surface of the building element. Furthermore, the final result is not always reliable, in particular when the building element is light or when the weather conditions are not suitable. In order to avoid the above mentioned problems and to estimate the real thermal transmittance value an alternative experimental method, here referred as the natural convection and radiation method, is proposed in this paper. For determination of thermal transmittance, this method requires only temperatures of inside and outside air, as well as the inner wall surface temperature. A detailed statistical analysis, performed by the software package SPSS ver. 20, shows several more advantages of this method comparing to the standard heat flow meter one, besides economic and non-destructive benefits.

AB  - Given the 24-h turn-around time before swimming advisories are released, advisories issued to protect public health really only indicates 'it may be unsafe to swim yesterday'. Predictive modelling for Escherichia coli concentrations at inflow-impacted beaches may be a favourable alternative to the current, routinely criticised monitoring approach. Using a total of 482 sets of meteorological and bacteriological data covering 14 swimming seasons, as well as environmental data of 10 inflow streams, this study developed models that could be used for predicting E. coli concentrations at five Lake Rotorua beaches. The models include predictor variables such as wind speed, antecedent rainfall, suspended solids at Puarenga, Utuhina and Ngongotaha stream inflows and particulate inorganic phosphorus concentration at Puarenga stream inflow. The combined 2011-2012 models had an average-adjusted R-2 of 0.73, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.33 logCFU/100 mL and captured 38% of the variance in the validation data when used to predict E. coli concentrations for an additional 2 years (2013-2014). Among the individual beach models, predictive accuracy ranged from 88.89 to 92.31 % for the three beaches considered in the study. The developed models can provide a faster estimation of E. coli condition, potentially assisting local beach managers in the decision process related to swimming advisories issuance.

AB  - In organizational systems commonly presented knowledge acts as a driver for achieving efficiency of organizational processes. Managing such knowledge within formal and stable systems is recognized as an essential component and relies on the ability to easily define the knowledge needs within the organization. However, trying to apply everyday approaches to complex organizational systems based on the cooperation between public and private entities, the conditions of extracting as-is information become blurred and tangible efficiency indicators cannot be jointly defined. In this paper, we present a case study of a missing person investigation that occurred in 2013 in Slovenia. With a variety of activity flows, several endings and tendency towards entity changes the investigation presents a challenging case for the identification and evaluation of knowledge that was present within the investigation process. Having the possibility to closely follow the investigation process, we collected the data through the observation and interviews of the key entities, then modelled with Tabular application development methodology, translated into the two-tier simulation model within iGrafx environment and finally analyzed with descriptive and multivariate statistics. Using the selected set of methods, we were able to design a graphical model that presents knowledge and most important interactions between knowledge resources within the investigation process. We find it as an important contribution to the understanding of knowledge dynamics within complex organizational systems.

AB  - Fluctuating water temperatures can affect fitness in fish when the opportunity to select habitats with appropriate temperature is limited. Despite the importance of the relationships between water temperature and host-pathogen interactions, reports on the susceptibility of fish to infectious viruses under conditions of changing water temperature are limited. Here, we compared the survival rates of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) infected with Cyprinid hopesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) in water in which the temperature varied from 22 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C and in water with a constant temperature of 22 degrees C or 25 degrees C. We also examined changes in concentrations of CyHV-3 DNA and cortisol released from infected fish into ambient water as indicators of CyHV-3 transmission and stress response, respectively. The survival rates of fish infected with CyHV-3 were lower, and concentrations of CyHV-3 DNA and cortisol were higher, in the fluctuating-temperature treatments than in the constant-temperature treatments. Our findings provide direct evidence that carp are highly susceptible to CyHV-3 infection when water temperatures change diurnally. Moreover, such temperature fluctuations can promote transmission of CyHV-3 in the wild. Preserving a variety of aquatic environments including water temperature may help to prevent disease outbreaks and to conserve fish populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Overwhelming use of engineered nanoparticles demands rapid assessment of their environmental impacts. The transport of cerium oxide nanoparticles (nCeO(2)) in plants and their impact on cellular homeostasis as a function of exposure duration is not well understood. In this study, kidney bean plants were exposed to suspensions of similar to 8 +/- 1 nm nCeO(2) (62.5 to 500 mg/L) for 15 days in hydroponic conditions. Plant parts were analyzed for cerium accumulation after one, seven, and 15 days of nCeO(2) exposure. The primary indicators of stress like lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities, total soluble protein and chlorophyll contents were studied. Cerium in tissues was localized using scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron mu-XRF mapping, and the chemical forms were identified using mu-XANES. In the root epidermis, cerium was primarily shown to exist as nCeO(2), although a small fraction (12%) was biotransformed to Ce(III) compound. Cerium was found to reach the root vascular tissues and translocate to aerial parts with time. Upon prolonged exposure to 500 mg nCeO(2)/L, the root antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly reduced, simultaneously increasing the root soluble protein by 204%. In addition, leaf's guaiacol peroxidase activity was enhanced with nCeO(2) exposure in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the degradation of the beta-blockers in hospital wastewater by direct ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation with a focus on measurements at different initial pHs and Fe2+ concentrations, and the determination of kinetic constants. The results showed that these 'emerging contaminants' were completely degraded, when the removal rate of organic matter reached 30.6% and 49.1% for ozonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. Likewise, the aromaticity removal rates were 63.4% and 77.9% for zonation and Fe2+/ozonation, respectively. The experimental design showed that pH was the variable which had the greatest effect on the Fe2+/ozonation. The kinetic constants of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol degradation by direct ozonation complied with pseudo-first-order conditions, while Fe2+/ozonation was suited to a biphasic degradation model. The k(obs) tended to rise when the pH increases; propranolol showed high k(obs), which can be attributed to the naphthalene group (an electron-rich moiety). The identification of degradation products was carried out in aqueous solution using HPLC-MS2, followed by a suggestion of degradation pathways by means of ozonation. The degradation products proved to be dependent on the initial pH, and followed pathways that are based on direct ozonolysis and free radicals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most deep-sea benthic ecosystems are food limited and, in the majority of cases, are driven by the organic matter falling from the surface or advected downslope. Species may adapt to this scarceness by applying a wide variety of responses, such as feeding specialisation, niche width variation, and reduction in metabolic rates. The Mediterranean Sea hosts a gradient of food availability at the deep seafloor over its wide longitudinal transect. In the Mediterranean, broad regional studies on trophic habits are almost absent, and the response of deep-sea benthos to different trophic conditions is still speculative. Here, we show that both primary and secondary production processes taking place at surface layers are key drivers of deepsea food web structuring. By employing an innovative statistical tool, we interpreted bulk-tissue delta(13) C and delta(15) N isotope ratios in benthic megafauna, and associated surface and mesopelagic components from the 3 basins of the Mediterranean Sea at 3 different depths (1200, 2000, and 3000 m). The trophic niche width and the amplitude of primary carbon sources were positively correlated with both primary and secondary surface production indicators. Moreover, mesopelagic organic matter utilization processes showed an intermediate position between surface and deep benthic components. These results shed light on the understanding of deep-sea ecosystems functioning and, at the same time, they demand further investigation.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the toxic effect of a lethal concentration of six different commercially used textile dyes on the 46th stage of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. The tadpoles were exposed to Astrazon Red FBL, Astrazon Blue FGRL, Remazol Red RR, Remazol Turquoise Blue G-A, Cibacron Red FN-3G, and Cibacron Blue FN-R for 168 h in static test conditions, and thus, 168-h median lethal concentrations (LC(50)s) of each dye were determined to be 0.35, 0.13, 112, 7, 359, and 15.8 mg/L, respectively. Also, to evaluate the sublethal effects of each dye, tadpoles were exposed to different concentrations of dyes (with respect to 168-h LC(50)s) for 24 h. The alteration of selected enzyme activities was tested. For this aim, glutathione S-transferase (GST), carboxylesterase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were assayed. After dye exposure, the GST induction or inhibition and LDH induction indicated some possible mechanisms of oxidative stress and deterioration in aerobic respiration processes induced by the tested dyes. Findings of the study suggest that selected biomarker enzymes are useful in understanding the toxic mechanisms of these dyes in X. laevis tadpoles as early warning indicators. Therefore, these selected biomarkers may evaluate the effect of environmental factors, such as textile dye effluents and other industrial pollutants, on amphibians in biomonitoring studies.

AB  - As acid mine drainage (AMD) remediation is increasingly faced by governments and mining industries worldwide, the generation of metal-rich solid residues from the treatments plants is concomitantly raising. A proper environmental management of these metal-rich wastes requires a detailed characterization of the metal mobility as well as an assessment of this new residues stability. The European standard leaching test EN 12457-2, the US EPA TCLP test and the BCR sequential extraction procedure were selected to address the environmental assessment of dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS) residues generated in AMD passive treatment systems. Significant discrepancies were observed in the hazardousness classification of the residues according to the TCLP or EN 12457-2 test. Furthermore, the absence of some important metals (like Fe or Al) in the regulatory limits employed in both leaching tests severely restricts their applicability for metal-rich wastes. The results obtained in the BCR sequential extraction suggest an important influence of the landfill environmental conditions on the metals released from the wastes. To ensure a complete stability of the pollutants in the studied DAS-wastes the contact with water or any other leaching solutions must be avoided and a dry environment needs to be provided in the landfill disposal selected.

AB  - Organic geochemical evaluation of thirty-two Aptian to Campanian shale samples from seven wells drilled on the shelf of the Orange Basin (southwestern Atlantic margin) was carried out in order to determine their origin, depositional environment, thermal maturity and hydrocarbon potential. The shale samples, selected to represent highstand, lowstand and transgressive systems tracts, were analysed by Rock-Eval pyrolysis for total organic C characteristics and by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for n-alkanes, aliphatic isoprenoid hydrocarbons and biomarkers (steranes, hopanes and tricylic terpanes). For most of the shale samples Rock-Eval data, hydrogen (HI) and oxygen index (OI) point to mainly Type III terrigenous organic matter. Only a few samples of Turonian age reveal a higher proportion of marine organic matter being classified as Type II/III or Type II. Biomarker parameters suggest that the samples are deposited under suboxic to oxic environmental conditions. Rock-Eval data and biomarker maturity parameters assign for most of the samples a maturity level at the beginning of the oil window with some more mature samples of Aptian, Albian and Cenomanian age. The hydrocarbon generation potential is low for most of the shelf shales as indicated by the S2/S3 ratio and HI values. Exceptions are some samples of Turonian and Aptian age. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tropical forests are known for their diverse insect fauna. We aimed to determine the effect and relative importance of latitude, elevation and climatic factors affecting species richness and turnover in euglossine bee assemblages along a gradient of 18A degrees A latitude from tropical rainforests to subtropical, deciduous dry forests in Peru and Bolivia. Sixteen forest sites were sampled during the dry season. Variance partitioning techniques were applied to assess the relative effects of the spatial and environmental variables on species richness and composition. Furthermore, we conducted a Species Indicator Analysis to find characteristic species for the biogeographic zones. There was a significant decrease in species richness towards the subtropical area. The best predictors of species richness were precipitation and its consequences on soil properties as well as temperature seasonality. The abundance of euglossines was most closely related to precipitation and soil-pH, but the causal links of abundance to these factors is unclear since soil-pH itself is correlated to a drastic turnover of vegetation structure. Based on the analysis of assemblage composition we propose three different assemblages with a transitional zone at the southern tropical area. The biogeographical distribution of euglossine bees along our study transect appears to be primarily related to climatic conditions and does not reflect the common subdividion of Amazonia into drainage systems.

AB  - A comparison was made between conventional binary distillation and four feasible alternatives flowsheets to separate acetic acid from water attending to both economic and environmental criteria. All extraction steps use diethyl ether as an extractant. Our goals were, first, to estimate the economic and environmental incentives for each of the alternatives proposed in order to understand the trade-offs associated with each system and second, to show how, in some flowsheets, it is possible to rigorously decompose the system and perform detailed optimization without the necessity of simultaneous optimization of all the equipment implied in the flowsheet. To carry out the economic evaluation, two simple criteria were used: Economic Potential and Total Annual Cost. These parameters were chosen because they can be used at various stages in the chemical plant design without the necessity of a complete picture of the industrial process. The environmental impacts are measured through the Ecoindicator-99 methodology, which reflects the advances in the damaged-oriented methodology recently developed for Life Cycle Assessment. For each of the alternatives, detailed optimization was performed to determine the Pareto's individual curves using the epsilon-constraint method. With the individual Pareto curves, it is also possible to obtain the compound Pareto's curve, and to then superimpose the individual Pareto's curves associated with the five alternatives to identify the trade-offs of this multiobjective optimization and ultimately determine the best alternatives, and even their optimum operational conditions.

AB  - This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal pattern of farmland destroyed by natural hazards (FDNH) in China, using land-use data and socio-economic data from the Ministry of Land and Resources and the National Bureau of Statistics of China, respectively, and the ESRI's ArcGIS spatial analyst module. An index of destroyed rate of farmland due to natural hazards (DRFNH) was established to assess the regional anti-disaster capacity. The outcomes indicated that China's FDNH amounted to 1.662 million ha during 1988-2008, and the direct grain loss reached 6.055 million tonnes. In general, with the gradual improvement in agricultural anti-disaster capacity, both the DRFNH and area of FDNH in China has been declining in the last two decades. The area of FDNH was universally large and the DRFNH was relatively high at the national level during 1988-1998, but the DRFNH and the area of FDNH took on an obvious declining trend during 1999-2008 due to the improvement of agricultural production conditions and the implementation of building new countryside strategy. Then, this paper established an integrated prevention and treatment system of China's FDNH, which includes the aspects of assessment of natural disaster risk and FDNH status quo, reconstruction for regional anti-disaster facilities, FDNH rehabilitation, disaster early warning system, and improving relevant organization and management.

AB  - In response to rising input costs and narrowing profit margins, soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] producers are continually looking for ways to increase soybean yield. One approach being promoted is the use of foliar fungicides, for both foliar pathogen control and nonfungicidal plant physiological effects. The objective of this field experiment was to evaluate a strobilurin and a triazole alone or in combination on soybean in the absence of foliar diseases to determine the potential effect on soybean growth and yield. The experiment was conducted in Iowa at one location in 2005 and two locations in 2006 with four soybean cultivars. Triazole (tebuconazole), a curative fungicide and strobilurin (pyraclostrobin), a preventative fungicide, were applied alone and in combination at growth stages R1, R3, and R5. Low levels of foliar diseases were observed. Seed yield for the control treatment averaged 4308 kg ha(-1) across all sites. Foliar fungicides did not affect soybean seed yield. Few differences were observed among the treatments in soybean growth and yield components. Total biomass was 10% greater with the pyraclostrobin applied at R3 compared with the control, and was a result of increased stem weight. In this study, fungicides applied in the absence of foliar disease did not produce nonfungicidal physiological effect or associated yield improvement. It was concluded that environmental conditions and assessment of disease levels should be used as a guide for foliar fungicide application on soybean.

AB  - Aims: This study investigated the influence of a range of evaporation rates (2.0, 5.3 and 7.4 mm day(-1)) on degradation of E. coli (ATCC Strain 25922) inoculated in canine faeces.
   Methods and Results: Experiments were carried out in an environmental chamber and a first order exponential decay function (Chick's Law) was used to estimate degradation rates. We estimated die-off coefficients using linear regression. Die-off rates were -0.07, -0.22 and -0.23 h(-1), respectively, for evaporation rates of 2.0, 5.3 and 7.4 mm day(-1) (P = 0.000+, for each model). Nearly complete die-off was found within 15-60 h (7.4-2.0 mm day(-1) evaporation rates), which corresponds with a water potential of approximately -22.4 MPa.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that canine faeces need not be desiccated to achieve complete loss of indicator organisms. Water potential, which is a combination of osmotic and matric potential, is a key stress that increases as evaporation removes water from the faecal matrix and increases concentration of the remaining faecal solution. Evaporation may remove populations of indicator organisms in faeces relatively quickly, even though faeces are not completely dehydrated.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This research may be used as the foundation for studies more closely resembling real-world evaporation conditions including diurnal fluctuations, rewetting and freezing.

AB  - This review covers international research on the fabrication, microstructure, properties and applications of glass and glass-ceramic matrix composites reinforced with continuous fibres. The most important research work reported in the scientific literature since the discovery of these composites in the late 60 s is reviewed. It will be shown that several fabrication procedures have reached an advanced development stage and that nowadays reliable, high-quality glass matrix composite materials are available. However, the literature analysis demonstrates that several challenges remain for future developments in this area. These include the need for a further understanding of the thermomechanical behaviour of the composites and the assessment of environmental and chemical interactions under in-service realistic conditions, i.e., mostly at high temperatures and in oxidative or corrosive atmospheres. It is also emphasised that relatively limited R&D work has been carried out so far in the area of manufacturing of engineering components and structures having complex geometry and large dimensions. Specifically there is a lack of development of adequate machining and joining techniques. The ultimate goal of this review is to generate a broader interest in glass and glass-ceramic matrix composites in both the scientific and industrial communities, so that the high technological potential of these materials can be exploited more widely.

AB  - Thalli of the lichen Ramalina duriaei (De Not.) Bagl., growing on carob twigs, were taken from an unpolluted forest area and transplanted within the original forest and to an industrial area in Northwest Israel. The production of ethylene by transplanted and nontransplanted lichen thalli left in the original forest and by transplanted thalli in the industrial area was measured after various periods of exposure of the thalli to their surroundings. Lichens produced larger amounts of ethylene in the polluted industrial sites than in the control site within their original unpolluted forest area. Changes in the production of ethylene were observed rather quickly under certain pollution conditions. Temporal and spatial fluctuations in the production of ethylene of a sensitive lichen, rather than the absolute amounts of ethylene produced by transplanted thalli, were deemed to reflect environmental stress in the lichen and were used as a bioindicator of air pollution. Thalli retrieved in the vicinity of a steel smelter bore on/in their cortex large amounts of S and Fe, as detected with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Such thalli also showed large amounts of Na and Cl on/in the cortex. Probable correlations between fluctuations in ethylene production by lichens and environmental factors are discussed.

AB  - Theoretical and previous experimental studies of rigid particle structures have only considered the behaviour of rigid particles for which the interface between particle and matrix is coherent. In natural rocks, the boundary behaviour may cover the whole range from free-slip to complete coherence. Examples where slip may be promoted include crack-seal deformation during the development of pressure shadows, core-mantle structures, where the mantle is composed of much weaker, fine recrystallized material, and crystallizing magmas or partially molten rocks where grain boundaries are lubricated by the melt phase. Analogue scale-model experiments have been performed under pure shear and simple shear conditions to compare the particle rotation and the flow in the matrix for both slipping and non-slipping particle/matrix interfaces. When slip does occur, particles rotate faster in pure shear and slower in simple shear than for non-slip, leading to the more rapid development of a shape preferred orientation. The preferred orientation tends to be bimodal in simple shear flow. The flow and finite strain patterns in the matrix are also strongly influenced by slip at the interface and porphyroclast systems can develop geometries with ambiguous or contradictory shear senses, dependent on the original particle orientation. In multi-particle experiments, slip on the interfaces enhances strong strain localization in non-linear viscous material, to produce patterns very similar to natural S-C fabrics.

AB  - Measuring economic growth is not only an arithmetic problem, it also involves an economic vision and a philosophy for the choice of indicators (i.e. Gross Domestic Product). Today it seems more relevant to measure not only the economic well-being as it is, using Gross Domestic Product, but also the people's well-being, considering other dimensions such as health and happiness. Over the years, national accounts and Gross Domestic Product have never changed their nature, instead combining social and economic indicators can offer important indications for well-being research. As pointed out by the World Health Organization, health is well-being, but it is not always coincident with a high level of Gross Domestic Product. In particular, as regards the mental health condition it has become an important aspect in measuring people's well-being. Mental health has been considered an important signal of the society's discomfort due to economic growth that, generally, is argued to be caused by the disamenities of the "industrial lifestyle". This study involves an empirical investigation using a panel econometric model in Italian regions, considering antidepressant expenditures per capita (an expression of society's unhappiness) as the dependent variable and, as covariates, the old age index, the poverty rate, the employment rate, the NEET rate (NEET: Not in Education, Employment, or Training), and the percentage of public expenditure in services.

AB  - Female choice is an important driver of sexual selection, but can be costly, particularly when choosy females risk remaining unmated or experience delays to reproduction. Thus, females should reduce choosiness when mate encounter rates are low. We asked whether choosiness is affected by social context, which may provide reliable information about the local availability of mates. This has been demonstrated in the lab, but rarely under natural conditions. We studied western black widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus) in the field, placing experimental final-instar immature females so they were either 'isolated' or 'clustered' near naturally occurring conspecifics (>= 10m or <= 1m, respectively, from a microhabitat occupied by at least one other female). Upon maturity, females in both treatments were visited by similar numbers of males, but clustered females were visited by males earlier and in more rapid succession than isolated females, confirming that proximity to conspecifics reduces the risk of remaining unmated. As predicted, isolated females were less choosy in staged mating trials, neither rejecting males nor engaging in pre-copulatory cannibalism, in contrast to clustered females. These results demonstrate that exposure of females to natural variation in demography in the field can alter choosiness of adults. Thus, female behaviour in response to cues of local population density can affect the intensity of sexual selection on males in the wild.

AB  - Vertical roller mill (VRM) is a large-scale grinding equipment, which is used to grind raw materials from block/ granule into powder. Due to harsh production environment and inconsistent raw material quality, VRM requires timely regulation. Currently, the regulation of VRM is manually conducted; operators make decisions based on their observation and experience, therefore the timeliness and accuracy of regulation cannot be guaranteed. This study presents a data-driven online control decision-making approach; it extracts several key indicators for state judgment from the historical running state data, constructs a stable mode library based on clustering the running state, mines the association rules among variables, and establishes the rolling prediction model to predict the changes in the key indicators. In real-time operation, the target state is obtained by comparing the real-time state and stable mode library, and then the corresponding control strategy, composed of key indicators, controllable parameters and target state, is auto-generated to support the management of VRM operation. In this way, a closed-loop framework is formed based on offline data mining and online decision-making, supporting the operation optimization of VRM. This approach is applied in a cement plant as a case study in Jiangsu, China. The results show that the control strategy is effective in actual working conditions; the continuous operation of the equipment with vibration reduction is achieved.

AB  - Humidity detection range is an important indicator for measuring the performance of humidity sensors, but semiconductor humidity sensors often face the problems of narrow detection ranges and insufficient detection sensitivities. In this paper, a magnesium oxide (MgO) humidity sensor based on micro-arc oxidation (MAO) technology was designed to solve these problems by simultaneously using impedance and capacitance as the response signals, as well as by normalizing the output of the two signals. The experimental results showed that the average output of the micro-arc MgO ceramic film, with impedance as the response signal, could reach 150 in the low relative humidity(RH) range (11.3-67% RH), which was much higher than its sensitivity in the high humidity range (< 1), and the film showed fast response (13 s) and recovery (61 s). Under high humidity conditions (67-97.3% RH), with capacitance as the response signal, the output of the micro-arc MgO was as high as 120. Therefore, the micro-arc MgO humidity sensor with impedance, and the sensor with capacitance as the response signal, demonstrated good stability in low humidity and in high humidity environments, respectively, indicating that the method of selecting appropriate response signals for different humidity environments can be applied to extend the humidity detection range of sensing material, and to improve the humidity detection capability of a sensor.

AB  - Organophosphate esters used as flame retardants and plasticizers are ubiquitous contaminants in surface waters. Many studies indicate that these compounds are neurotoxicants, endocrine disruptors, and may affect reproduction and development of aquatic organisms. Thus, analytical methods that allow accurate quantification of these contaminants at environmentally relevant concentrations are desirable for risk assessment studies. In this study, a method based on solid phase extraction and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was developed for determination of organophosphate esters in river water extracts. Multivariate optimization was used to determine the best conditions for injection of larger volumes of sample in a Programmable Temperature Vaporization inlet. Furthermore, the matrix effect on the instrumental response was evaluated and compensated by association of extraction-blank-matched calibration and isotopically labeled focus standards. The method quantification limits ranged from 0.009 to 0.11 mu g/L, staying below the predicted non-effect concentration for the aquatic compartment for all analytes, which is a requisite for using in risk assessment studies. The method was applied to freshwater samples collected in rivers from the Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and eight out of the ten target organophosphate esters were quantified, being tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate and tris(phenyl) phosphate the most frequently detected compounds.

AB  - Future-generation radio access networks (RAN) are projected to fulfill the diverse requirements of user equipment (UE) by adopting a heterogeneous network (HetNet) environment. Necessary integration of different radio access technologies (RAT), such as 2G, 3G, 4G, wireless local area network (WLAN), and visible light communication (VLC) is inevitable. Moreover, UEs equipped with diverse requirements will be capable of accessing some or all the RATs. The complex HetNet environment with diverse requirements of UEs will present many challenges. The HetNet is likely to suffer severely from load imbalance among the base stations (BSs) from inheriting the traditional user association scheme such as max-SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio)/max-RSSI (received signal strength indicator), unless some sophisticated schemes are invented. In this paper, a novel scheme is devised for a joint-user association for load balancing, where BSs are densely deployed and UEs typically have a certain degree of mobility. Unlike most of the present works, a dynamic network is considered where the position and channel condition of the UEs are not fixed. We develop two complex and distributed association schemes based on probability and d-choices, while carefully considering both loads of the BSs and SINR experienced by the UEs. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed schemes by showing a received data-rate fairness among UEs and an improvement in the UE's minimum received data rate.

AB  - Picoeukaryotes are important members of the surface ocean microbial community with high diversity and significant temporal and spatial variations in community composition. Little is known about the picoeukaryotic biodiversity and community in the Yellow Sea, where hydrologic conditions are very different with the influence of the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC). Using Illumina high throughput sequencing targeting 18S rDNA, we investigated the composition of picoeukaryotes at a permanent monitoring site in the central Yellow Sea from 2011 to 2013. Alveolata, Stramenopiles, and Archaeplastida were the main super groups found. Prasinophytes were dominant in N-YSWC (not influenced by the YSWC) samples whilst YSWC (influenced by the YSWC) samples were dominated by different groups, such as MALV-II (novel marine Alveolata), MAST-3, MAST-4 (novel marine Stramenopiles), and Dictyochophyceae. N-YSWC samples were grouped together in nMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) using the Bray-Curtis method. Distances between each two YSWC samples were greater. Based on indicator operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis (IOA), indicator species of the YSWC were represented by Pseudochattonella farcimen, Florenciella parvula within the class Dictyochophyceae, and Phaeocystis cordata within the class Prymnesiophyceae. The findings in our study suggest that picoeukaryotic communities in the central Yellow Sea differ temporally in response to changes in the YSWC.

AB  - Flaxseeds are both a food ingredient and a natural source of antioxidants (e.g. lignans, PUFAs) and pro oxidant contaminants (e.g. cadmium): the variable mixture of anti- and pro-oxidant substances may impact on the redox homeostasis of flaxseed-enriched foods. The antioxidant power is studied here as biochemical activity of flaxseeds in white wheat bread and as endpoint for possible screening of anomalous variations of bioactive mixtures (antioxidants vs. prooxidants) in food matrices.
   A bioprobe assay based on the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme (6 channels of the multiprobe bioelectronic platform BEST) was performed on white wheat bread with and without flaxseeds. Nine BEST channels were simultaneously used for validation and monitoring of measuring conditions (temperature, pH, conductivity). Findings were compared with quantitative analysis of antioxidants and pro oxidant contaminants. Organic and aqueous extracts of both bread types were examined in parallel.
   The SOD-probe detected the difference in antioxidant power given by 10% flaxseed, thus supporting the use of antioxidant power detected by bioenzymatic screening as sensitive biochemical endpoint. Mixtures of bioactive molecules in foods generate biochemical activities that can be monitored as time effective indicators of invariability, which is pivotal in the daily control of anomalies in food production and therefore in the protection of consumers' health.

AB  - Cattle treated with the veterinary parasiticide ivermectin fecally excrete residues. The authors report the exposition and dissipation characteristics of these residues in dung of ivermectin-treated cattle and in soil beneath this dung on pastures in Canada, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. Residues were quantified for dung collected from cattle after 3d, 7d, 14d, and 28d posttreatment and subsequently exposed in the field for up to 13mo. The authors optimized a high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection method to detect ivermectin residues in dung and soil matrices. They showed that a solid phase extraction and purification step generally can be eliminated to reduce the time and cost of these analyses. They also found that the addition of water to relatively dry samples improves the extraction efficiency of residues. They then analyzed the field samples to document differences in ivermectin dissipation in cattle dung among sites, with 50% dissipation times of up to 32d and 90% dissipation times >396d. They further showed that the dissipation characteristics of residues are comparable between dung of ivermectin-treated cattle and dung to which ivermectin has been added directly. Lastly, they report the first use of a desorption electrospray ionization-high-resolution-mass spectrometric method to detect residues of metabolites in a dung matrix.

AB  - Global increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2, coupled with increasingly sporadic and intense precipitation regimes, may affect the biodiversity of boreal forest communities, potentially leading to shifts in functional process rates such as decomposition. However, the effects of these factors on microarthropod community composition have not been thoroughly studied in combination in controlled settings. We conducted a full factorial experiment exposing moss/soil mesocosms to three temperatures (11.5, 15.5, and 19.5 degrees C), two CO2 levels (430 ppm and 750 ppm), and three moisture levels (drought, intermediate, and saturated conditions) for 18 weeks. Following treatment, we quantified effects on species diversity of a representative group of mesofaunal microarthropods, the Collembola. We also quantified the effects of these factors on the distribution of collembolan body sizes as an indicator of functional changes in the community. We found that moisture regime was a dominant factor, with increased precipitation leading to decreased collembolan abundance and richness. The mechanisms of these detrimental effects are unclear but may be due to the saturation of air-filled soil pore space or competition with moisture-tolerant species. Severe precipitation regimes caused a general loss of abundance in species of all sizes, which may have long term effects on boreal forest soil food webs. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), including herbal and folk medicine have been widely applied in healthcare field for a very long time. Based on the principle of kinetics, pharmacokinetics of TCM was developed to investigate the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of active ingredients/components, single or mixed formulations, as well as the relationship between concentration and efficacy presented. Due to the complexity of TCM and its preparation, selection of molecules as markers for detection has become very difficult. So far, in which way or what indicators can be chosen for representing the pharmacodynamic action of single TCM or mixed is still controversial. Currently, a widely accepted approach is that the action of mixed preparation can be correlated by detecting pharmacokinetic behavior of one or several known active ingredients. According to the complexity of TCM, we presented a new concept of pharmacokinetic (PK) marker. The PK Marker should possess three conditions: (1) PK marker must be associated with efficacy, (2) PK marker exists in biological sample and can be determined by analytic method, and (3) PK marker should reflect the relationship between concentration and time. In TCM, four elements, "king-minister-assistant-guide", are the basic prescription principles for the individual therapy in TCM. We presented an idea of Point-line-area-cubic for four elements of TCM to study herb-herb interactions.

AB  - The forests of the Black Sea coast of Turkey harbour a rich forest bryophyte flora that derived from a northern floristic element of Laurasian origin. Surprisingly many of them re-occur far in the south in the Fagus orientalis relicts of the Amanos and the eastern foothills of the Aladaglari in a general Mediterranean environment. This leads to the question whether these species arrived in recent times by long-range dispersal or are relicts from a more humid late geological period which migrate via the Anatolian diagonal.
   A life strategy analysis with the main focus on reproduction and dispersal modes indicates a limited and very low long-range dispersal capacity for most of the species. Additional, the distribution patterns show that none of the 44 forest bryophytes analysed are recorded from the mountains of the Anatolian diagonal. Although, long-range dispersal is possible in more than one third of the species, spore dispersal, spore germination and the establishment of population can not observed at sites along the Anatolian diagonal under the present climatic conditions. Thus the study give force to the relict hypothesis and common migration and distribution of the bryophytes together with the Fagus orientalis forests during more humid past geological periods. Most of the species must be seen as "migration relicts" that survived together with the Fagus orientalis forests in South Turkey.

AB  - There are little data concerning clinical characteristics of women with Tourette disorder and chronic tic disorders in the extant literature and what is available mostly focuses on treatment-seeking individuals. The present research was conducted to provide a phenomenological characterization of tic disorders among 185 adult women with tic disorders. In addition to providing a descriptive overview of specific tic symptoms, tic severity, self-reported history of other psychiatric conditions, and impairment/lifestyle impact due to tics, this study compares 185 women and 275 men between 18 and 79 years old with tic disorders (who completed an identical battery of measures) based on demographic, social/economic status indicators, psychiatric variables (comorbidity, family psychiatric history, symptom presentation), adaptive functioning/quality of life, and impairment variables among a nonclinical adult sample. Finally, this research examines the relationship between tic severity and impairment indicators among women with tics. Sixty-eight percent of women in our sample reported severe motor tics and 40% reported severe phonic tics. Our exploratory data suggest that a sizeable number of adult women with persistent tics are suffering from psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial consequences such as underachievement and social distress. Tic severity in women may be associated with lifestyle interference as well as with symptoms of depression and anxiety, and such symptoms may be more common among women with tics than in men with tics.

AB  - Wetland restoration projects across the United States commonly lack the species and hydrology of the targeted community being restored. A better understanding of natural wetlands would help restoration project designers achieve community composition and hydrologic regimes that more closely resemble natural conditions. We investigated two different methods to identify patterns in hydrologic regime useful to restoration design. The first method was based on success criteria commonly used by North Carolina wetland mitigation projects. The second method was based on The Nature Conservancy's Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. To test these two methods, we collected hydrologic and compositional data across the natural variation of nonriverine wet hardwood forest stands, a rare wetland community type commonly restored in North Carolina. Our results show that hydrologic parameters from the first method, based on current success criteria used in North Carolina, are not related to community composition. Hydrologic parameters from the second method, e.g. the maximum water table level over a 3-day span, explained much of the variation in nonriverine wet hardwood forest community composition. Our results found that clear relationships do exist between hydrologic regime and community composition. Hydrologic parameters that are related to community composition need to be used as success criteria in future restoration designs. This will ensure that projects establish the appropriate hydrologic regime necessary to foster the desired wetland community type. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The spring Hadley circulation is observed to be negatively correlated to the summer tropical cyclone frequency in the western North Pacific. This relationship is linked by the summer atmospheric circulation anomalies resulting from the anomalous spring Hadley circulation. To examine the authenticity of such a relationship indicated by the observation, a simulation on the strong spring Hadley circulation scenario by IAP9L-AGCM is performed, and the response of the environmental conditions affecting the tropical cyclone genesis is analyzed in the present study. Results show that in relation to the strong spring Hadley circulation, larger magnitude of the vertical zonal wind shear and the anomalous low-level divergence and upper-level convergence are predominated in the western North Pacific In summer. The East Asian summer monsoon is also weakened. Such an atmospheric circulation background is unfavorable for the tropical cyclone genesis, and thus the tropical cyclone frequency in the western North Pacific is decreased. The numerical simulation supports the observation, demonstrating the existence of the out-of-phase relationship between the spring Hadley circulation and the summer tropical cyclone frequency in the western North Pacific. So, the variation of the spring Hadley circulation can be a potential indicator in predicting summer tropical cyclone activities in the western North Pacific.

AB  - Objective: The medicinal value of plants lies in some chemical substrates that produce a definitive physiological action on the human body. Ankaferd comprises a standardized mixture of the plants Thymus vulgaris, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Vitis vinifera, Alpinia officinarum and Urtica dioica. The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activities of Ankaferd medicinal plant extract. Material and Methods: The antimicrobial activity assay was performed by agar well diffusion to assess the antagonistic activity of Ankaferd against 26 indicator strains including human pathogens and food spoiling gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Results: Ankaferd was active against all bacteria tested while nisin, the only commercial bacteriocin for food preservation, was inactive against gram-negative indicator strains. Besides a high inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including human pathogens and food spoiling bacteria, Ankaferd was more stable than nisin in different heat and enzyme treatments. Conclusion: Antibacterial activity of Ankaferd can be extended to extreme environmental conditions such as the potential use of the preparation for the treatment of infectious diseases and preservation of different type foods from food-born pathogens or food spoiling bacteria. The demonstration of the anti-infective properties of Ankaferd adds a new value to its haemostatic effect in the healing of infected hemorrhagic wounds, as well as opening new avenues for its potential use for anti-infective actions and food preservation.

AB  - The number of animals used in science is increasing, bringing a concomitant obligation to minimize suffering. For animals with progressive conditions, euthanasia at a 'humane end point' is advised if the end point is scientifically valid, predictive and accurate. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that behavioural changes would reliably precede clinical signs of disease in a progressive neurological model, using retrospective analysis. We observed 100 pair-housed female R6/1 transgenic Huntington's disease (HD) mice and 28 pair-housed female wild-type (WT) mice in standard- or resource-enriched cages. Disease progression was monitored until one member of each HD pair reached a pre-defined end point based on pathological symptoms (HD end). This mouse was then euthanized together with its cage mate (HD other) and any matched WT pairs. At euthanasia, HD mice had significantly greater absolute and relative organ weights, and significantly higher alpha 1 acid glycoprotein concentrations than WT mice, indicating reduced welfare. HD mice initially showed significantly greater use of cage resources than WT mice but this declined progressively. Steeper declines, and earlier cessation, in the use of some climbing and exploration resources occurred in the HD end mice compared with the HD other mice. Behavioural change can be an early indicator of disease onset.

AB  - Within the context of monitoring desertification using a network of observatories, one faces the problem of the representativeness of biophysical, ecological, and socioeconomic variations. Ideally, one would choose at least one, observatory for each homogeneous zone using indicators that capture these variations. Here, we focused only on ecoclimatic aspects defined by the global physical and climatic conditions characterizing and and semiarid zones. The challenging aim of this paper is to spatially identify the different patterns of ecoclimatic variations. For most of the indicators of and or semiarid zones, temporal characteristics and interactions through a typical year are observed. In order to take into account these dynamics in the clustering approach, one must use a methodology that captures interactions between spatial location, time of measurement, and indicator measured. For this purpose, a multiway analysis, generalizing principal component analysis, has been used on internationally recognized ecoclimatic indicators that characterize and and semiarid zones. Most of these indicators were used nondynamically or qualitatively to approve and certify observatories of the Reseau d'Observatoires pour le Suivi Ecologique a Long Termes network. A direct application of this method would be to assess homogeneity and validity of ecoclimatic characteristics for each observatory comparative to its regional location within its country or within the whole circum-Saharan region.

AB  - Among benthic organisms, bivalves are often used as bioindicators of environmental pollution because of their high bioaccumulation capacities for heavy metals leading to metallothioneins (MT) induction. MT are small cytosolic metal-binding proteins involved in metal homeostasis and detoxification in living organisms. These proteins can also be induced by a wide range of factors, such as hormones, physical stress, parasitism. MT quantification in relation to parasitism is rarely reported in literature, while parasites are omnipresent and have deleterious impacts on bivalves. Moreover, only a few number of MT genes have been characterized in molluscs. This study describes the partial sequence of the MT gene (Cemt1) in the edible cockle Cerastoderma edule. The cockle's MT cDNA was sequenced and showed over 80% homology to several other bivalve MT sequences. This sequence was then used to determine MT specific primers which can be used in quantitative real time PCR. MT protein and gene expression levels were quantified for individuals selected under different conditions: free from or infected by the digenean trematode Himasthla elongata, and under cadmium exposure at 15 mu g Cd L-1. Results evidenced that MT concentrations were significantly increased by both treatments; parasite infection and Cd exposure. Moreover, congruent results between MT protein and gene expression levels were obtained.

AB  - Biogenic structures in Holocene sediments from the Archipelago Sea, northern Baltic Sea, were characterized through the analysis of X-ray images of four cores collected from water depths between 32 and 66 m. In the area, initial colonization of endobenthic invertebrates occurred at 7800 +/- 80 calendar years BP. The trace assemblage at this level is low-diversity, small-diameter, shallowly tiered, and Palaeophycus-dominated; rare Arenicolites are also observed. Early colonization coincides with increasing marine influence in the post-glacial lacustrine setting just before the dramatic onset of brackish-water conditions established after 7600 BP. The post-incursion brackish-water assemblage possesses a higher diversity of traces (Planolites, Arenicolites, Lockeia, Teichichnus), which is taken to reflect the enhanced salinity and trophic state of the basin. The shift from Palaeophycus-mottling to a Planolites-dominated fabric represents changed behavioural patterns in the endobenthic community due to changed substrate properties. The ethology of the succeeding trace assemblage also represents a switch from domicile-based activities, such as predation, scavenging and interface-dominated deposit feeding to shallow-tier deposit feeding. Finally, traces are excluded from thinly laminated intervals, demonstrating that seafloor oxygen deficiency commonly reached levels that were detrimental to colonization of the sediment substrate.

AB  - Two-photon excitation (2PE) of "caged" biomolecules represents a powerful method to investigate the temporal and spatial relevance of physiological function in real time and on living tissue, because the excitation volume can be restricted to 1 fL. Additionally, low-energy IR light is used, which minimizes tissue destruction and enables deeper penetration into tissue preparations. Exploitation of this technology for studying cell physiology requires the further development of photoremovable protecting groups with sufficient sensitivity to 2PE for use in "caged" compounds. 8-Bromo-7-hydroxyquinoline (BHQ) is efficiently photolyzed by classic 1PE (365 nm) and 2PE (740 nm) under simulated physiological conditions (aqueous buffer of high ionic strength, pH 7.2) to release carboxylates, phosphates, and diols-functional groups commonly found on bioactive molecules such as neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, and drugs. It is stable in the dark, soluble in water, and exhibits low levels of fluorescence, which will enable use in conjunction with fluorescent indicators of biological function. BHQ-protected effectors are synthetically accessible. Stern-Volmer quenching, time-resolved infrared (TRIR), and O-18-labeling experiments suggest that the photolysis occurs through a solvent-assisted photolheterolysis (SO) reaction mechanism on the sub-microsecond time scale. BHQ has the requisite photochemical and photophysical properties as a photoremovable protecting group to regulate the action of biological effectors in cell and tissue culture with light, especially 2PE.

AB  - The most important tobacco producing areas in Greece were surveyed for virus presence, from 1997 to 2000. Tobacco seedlings or plants showing virus-like symptoms were randomly collected from seedbeds or fields, respectively, and tested by ELISA, and/or mechanical inoculation onto indicator plants. Potato virus Y (PVY), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were detected in all sampling areas, with TMV mainly found in oriental varieties. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) consisted a serious endemic virus in Northern Greece (Thrace, Central and Eastern Macedonia), whereas Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) was mainly found in regions, where alfalfa was cultivated in the vicinity of tobacco crops. Eggplant mottled dwarf virus (EMDV) was detected in several areas but always in very low incidence (< 0.01%). Surveys were also conducted to assess the potential reservoir hosts of PVY, CMV and AMV among weeds collected from highly infected tobacco fields from 1998 to 2000. Among 3450 samples tested for PVY, plants from 17 species in 10 families were found infected. For CMV, 2891 weed samples were tested and 19 species in 12 families were positive. Assays for AMV infection were made on 961 samples and 12 species in 9 families were identified as hosts of this virus.

AB  - Key forage species lie at the core of complex marine food webs, providing essential linkages among trophic levels. We examined the interactions of an important forage and commercial fish, capelin Mallotus villosus, and its primary avian predator, the common murre Uria aalge, in the NW Atlantic. Murres are capelin specialists and robust samplers of capelin biology. During the 1990s, the coldest surface-water event in the past 50 to 100 yr occurred in the NW Atlantic (1991), and the eastern Canadian ground-fishery was closed (1992). Concordantly, the biology and behaviour of capelin has undergone very substantial changes. We examined parental food deliveries and production at the world's largest common murre colony on Funk Island off the northeast coast of Newfoundland throughout the 1990s. Murres delayed breeding and delivered smaller and lower quality capelin to their chicks. These changes, corroborated with independent fisheries data, resulted in poor condition of murre chicks, indicating significant effects of changing capelin demographics at higher trophic levels. The diets of the murre chicks indicate that the composition of the capelin population has shifted from high size diversity to mainly smaller capelin. We hypothesize that this change resulted from the elimination of the larger-sized and earlier-spawning genotype and that the NW Atlantic capelin population is exhibiting signs of reduced reproductive potential that likely reflects lower spawning biomass.

AB  - This study concerned two perennial ectomycorrhizae of beech: Fagus sylvatica L./Lactarius blennius var. viridis and Fagus sylvatica L./Lactarius subdulcis, collected in a natural forest site. Nutritional exchanges existing between beech roots and fungi were evaluated over a seasonal cycle by studying the variations of ultrastructure, polyphosphate and nitrogenous granules and glycogen content (periodic acid thiocarbohydrazide silver test). The acid phosphatase activity, which is an indicator of the intensity of the physiological activity of symbiosis partners, was also revealed by transmission electron microscopy. The occurrence of the two ectomycorrhizae in the soil was not related to the climatic conditions. In winter, the number of polyphosphate and nitrogenous granules was high in the fungi, and glycogen was abundant in the cytoplasm of hyphae. In late winter, an intense acid phosphatase activity was revealed on plasmalemmas of live hyphae. It could indicate the beginning of fungal reserve mobilization, which progressively disappeared as spring progressed. In summer, glycogen was quasi nonexistent and only few polyphosphate and nitrogenous granules were observed. At this period, the acid phosphatase activity was weak. Finally, in autumn and early winter, glycogen and granules were progressively restored in fungal structures. Relationships between changes of granules and glycogen content and the physiological states of each symbiont throughout the year are discussed.

AB  - The influence of soil properties on nitrification potential was studied using a simple 4 h incubation test applied to 56 field-collected soils contaminated mainly with Pb or Cu. The soils were analyzed for total and dissolved metal and the soil solution was speciated for free Pb2+ or Cu2+ ions. The rates of nitrite production (NH4+ oxidation to NO2-) after the addition of a 1.0 mM NH4+ substrate and 2.0 mM NaClO3 varied between 25 and 4200 mu mol NO2- kg(-1) of soil d(-1). The rates of nitrate production (NH4+ oxidation to NO2- minus NO2- oxidation to NO3-) for the same experimental conditions without chlorate varied between 2 and 2420 mu mol NO2- kg(-1) of soil d(-1). The results show that the nitrification potential relationships with soil properties varied between sites. Soil pH and organic matter are the most influential parameters, but solution free metal activity and total metal content are also significant. It is not clear if soil pH and organic matter directly affect the nitrification potential or if they indirectly modify the chemical properties affecting metal speciation. However, given the high sensitivity of this microbial process towards many environmental soil parameters, the nitrification potential does not appear to be a straightforward specific bioindicator for the evaluation of soil metal contamination.

AB  - Salmonella typhimurium initiates infection of a host by invading M cells of Peyer's patches within the smalt intestine, The ability of the bacteria to invade mammalian cells has been shown to be regulated by environmental conditions, including oxygen concentrations, osmolarity, and growth phase, We have previously created oxygen-regulated Tn5lacZY S. typhimurium mutants that are defective in invasion, We have now identified the invasion genes disrupted by eight of the transposon insertions. These genes encode transcriptional regulators (hilA and invF), type III secretory components (orgA, invG and spaR) and secreted proteins (invC and invD). Examination of the protein-secretion profiles of the non-invasive mutants indicated that each of the mutants was defective in secretion of between one and six proteins, We have also demonstrated that the loss of tissue culture cell invasiveness corresponds to an inability to invade and destroy M cells of Peyer's patches in a murine ligated loop model, Virulence studies, performed in mice, demonstrated that these defects significantly reduced the ability of the mutants to cause murine typhoid fever by an oral route of infection, Virulence by an intraperitoneal route of infection was unaffected, The data indicate that in vitro invasiveness, invasion-protein secretion, and M-cell invasion are critical indicators of S. typhimurium virulence.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is regularly assessed in neuroimaging studies as an indicator of autonomic, emotional or cognitive processes. In this study, we investigated the influence of a loud and cramped environment during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on resting HRV measures. We compared recordings during functional MRI sessions with recordings in our autonomic laboratory (LAB) in 101 healthy subjects. In the LAB, we recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a photoplethysmogram (PPG) over 15 min. During resting state functional MRI, we acquired a PPG for 15 min. We assessed anxiety levels before the scanning in each subject. In 27 participants, we performed follow-up sessions to investigate a possible effect of habituation. We found a high intra-class correlation ranging between 0.775 and 0.996, indicating high consistency across conditions. We observed no systematic influence of the MRI environment on any HRV index when PPG signals were analyzed. However, SDNN and RMSSD were significantly higher when extracted from the PPG compared to the ECG. Although we found a significant correlation of anxiety and the decrease in HRV from LAB to MRI, a familiarization session did not change the HRV outcome. Our results suggest that psychological factors are less influential on the HRV outcome during MRI than the methodological choice of the cardiac signal to analyze.

AB  - While improved crop water-deficit tolerance is considered of primary importance, many phenotyping efforts focusing on quantifying structural root traits make assumptions about architecture representing root function. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify whole plant water-use traits among disparate peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) genotypes and determine their impact on water-deficit tolerance. Mini-rhizotrons were installed to evaluate genotypic root architecture and developmental changes to two irrigation regimes imposed during early development. Following the early-season irrigation regimes, above- and below-ground traits were studied across a range of soil water conditions through measures of: (a) leaf-level gas exchange and (b) soil water depletion quantified using a novel soil water probe inserted into mini-rhizotrons allowing for matched root architecture and soil water depletion measures. While differential water treatments influenced root system architecture development among the genotypes, soil water depletion locations were primarily determined by water availability in the soil profile, not simply by having greater root length at a given soil location. This contradicts the assumption that greater root presence is a consistent indicator of increased root activity. Phenotypic selection of root traits for improving the efficiency of crop water use should consider both structural and functional traits in relation to the intended production environments slated for future cultivar development.

AB  - Insect diversity and abundance are in drastic decline worldwide, but quantifying insect populations to better conserve them is a difficult task. Mark-release-recapture (MRR) is widely used as an ecological indicator for insect populations, but the accuracy of MRR estimates can vary with factors such as spatial scale, sampling effort and models of inference. We conducted a 3-year MRR study of B. thaidina in Yanzigou valley, Mt. Gongga but failed to obtain sufficient data for a robust population estimate. This prompted us to integrate B. thaidina life history information to parameterize agent-based models and evaluate the conditions under which successful MRR studies could be conducted. We evaluated: (1) the performance of MRR models under different landscape types, and (2) the influence of experimental design on the accuracy and variance of MRR-based estimates. Our simulations revealed systematic underestimates of true population parameters by MRR models when sampling effort was insufficient. In a total of 2772 simulations, subjective decisions in sampling protocol (e.g., frequency, number of sampling locations, use of spatially explicit models, type of estimands) accounted for nearly half of the variation in estimates. We conclude that MRR-based estimates could be improved with the addition of more field-specific parameters.

AB  - The formation of annual growth rings is an imperative requirement for studying the dendroecological potential of plant species. Little is known about the distinctness of growth rings in the wood of desert plants in Africa, particularly in southern Mediterranean regions. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected and anatomically analyzed about 300 perennial desert plants from different areas in Egypt. Out of the 300 studied plant species, 94 species were identified as growth-ring forming plants. They belong to 78 genera and 33 families. Trees, shrubs/ subshrubs, and perennial or short-lived herbs are represented by 7, 55, and 32 species, respectively. Trees and shrubs represent 7.4% and 58.5% of the total, respectively. The distinctness of growth rings in these species was indicated either by the type of wood porosity, fibers, marginal parenchyma layers or by a mixture of these characteristics. Ring porosity, fiber layer, and parenchyma were the main indicators for growth-ring distinctness in 77.7%, 60.6%, and 33.0% of growth-ring forming plants, respectively. We conclude that some of the desert plants form distinct growth rings depending on site conditions, while precipitation is the main driver for its formation. Further studies on the annual rhythm of xylem formation are required to confirm the annual nature of growth rings and potential dendroecological use of these plants.

AB  - Treatment performances of five lagoon (natural and aerated) wastewater treatment stations in the Mostaganem Region (Western Algerian) were evaluated to meet the expectations of stakeholders. This assessment was based on collected data to verify the functioning of the lagoons and the regulatory compliance of their discharge in order to evaluate the conditions of operation of the treatment facilities. Available historic data were supplemented by a sampling and analysis campaigns performed by the National Sanitation Office (Mostaganem Unit). The methodology used is based on the coupling of both functional and structural diagnoses of the treatment system and the use of conventional formulae to check the capacity of the different components of the system and justify scientifically and technically the adopted operational choices. The evaluation of Benyahi Station's performance showed relatively good performances, exceeding 80% for chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand up to the horizon 2045. The kinetic model of Ekcenfelder was used to simulate the reduction of solids and organic matter, and to estimate the specific power of the aeration system. The analysis of the situation of the five lagoons were carried out with satisfaction, where prospective scenarios of control of the process and management of the transfers of sewage between localities were carried out to better characterize the situation of wastewater treatment in the region by 2045. Finally, recommendations, based on rigorous computations and in-depth diagnoses, were proposed to reinforce the obtained management scenarios.

AB  - Hydrologically isolated wetlands offer critical ecosystem services including water filtration and storage, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat, among many others. Geomorphic features formed via landslides, termed slump blocks, along the central coast of California can create the ideal, lower angle conditions for wetland hydrology to persist, followed by hydrophytic vegetation and hydric soils. Areas susceptible to the formation of slump block wetlands are those along steep slopes underlain by metamorphosed ultramafic (serpentine) colluvial and residual parent materials due to their propensity to slip along fracture planes. The soils that form in these settings do not exhibit traditional redoximorphic features near the surface that are necessary to identify wetland soils via field observation of morphological features. The objective of this study is to examine the morphology of hydromorphic soils forming in serpentine colluvium and residuum and determine wetland status by employing a combination of biogeochemical, hydrological, and vegetative assessments. These serpentinite-derived soils forming on slump block geomorphic surfaces meet the technical standard of hydric soils using Indicator of Reduction in Soil tubes as a proxy, despite the lack of traditional observable redoximorphic features. In addition, both wetland hydrology and hydrophytic vegetation communities were documented, therefore meeting the three requirements of wetlands. Ultimately, the importance lies in properly identifying and delineating ecosystems in need of conservation and as such, we propose an alternate field indicator for use in serpentine soils forming in landslide-susceptible terrain.

AB  - Increasingly, researchers studying public beliefs about global warming have turned to the question of whether individuals have begun to perceive changes to their local climate conditions and to what extent they attribute these changes to the phenomenon of global warming. Perceptions of particular types of extreme events, i.e. extreme heat and droughts, have attracted the most attention, whereas the possible effects of place (such as proximity to coastal areas vulnerable to sea-level rise) on public beliefs about the link between changes to weather patterns and global warming have been largely neglected. This study matches geo-located responses to a nationally representative survey of US residents with climate extremes data in order to investigate the social and physical factors shaping public views about the links between global warming and extreme weather. Specifically, regional-level Climate Extremes Indices (CEI) are modelled together with individual-level socio-demographic characteristics and an indicator of coastal residence to test whether the incidence of extreme events and proximity to the coasts, net of social and economic factors, correspond to increased perceptions that global warming has affected the weather. Results indicate that coastal shoreline county residence significantly predicts individuals' beliefs about the extent to which global warming is affecting the weather.

AB  - The spatial distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates along reed transects was studied in lakes with minimal human disturbances to enable a deeper understanding of the functioning of reed macroinvertebrate communities and relations to biotic and abiotic environmental variables. The taxonomic and functional macroinvertebrate community composition significantly differed between outer margin, center, and shore locations. At shore locations, higher proportions of Gastropoda, Hydrachnidia and Coleoptera, mobile swimmers/skaters, predators, and shredders were found. However, outer margin locations were characterized by a higher proportion of sessile filter-feeding Bivalvia and mining Diptera. At the outer margins, also greater contributions of taxa preferring pelal habitats and r-strategists typical for more disturbed environments were observed. An indicator species analysis revealed Asellus aquaticus (Crustacea) and Scirtidae Gen sp. (Coleoptera) as significant indicator taxa for shore locations and Valvata piscinalis (Gastropoda), Tinodes sp. and Orthotrichia sp. (Trichoptera) as significant indicator taxa for outer margin locations. The taxonomic composition of macroinvertebrate communities was significantly related to higher water depth, oxygen content, and pH at outer margin locations. Shore locations were characterized by higher amounts of woody debris, leaf litter, and decaying plant material. In summary, the taxonomic and functional composition of macroinvertebrates varied strongly from shore to outer margin locations and could be related to spatial changes in hydrodynamical and food conditions along the transects.

In this study, the comparative fertilizer properties of mesophilic and thermophilic digestates from dairy manure were evaluated for plant nutrient contents, and special attention was paid to plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). Two digestates contained similar plant nutrient contents, while the thermophilic digestate contained higher contents of NH4 (+)-N. The quantity of Bacillus and Pseudomonas in the mesophilic digestate was significantly higher than in the thermophilic digestate. Furthermore, Bacillus showed siderophore production and antifungal activity (43.5-75.3%), and Pseudomonas showed siderophore and phytohormone production (4.2-75.2 A mu g ml(-1)). One phosphate solubilizing isolate was also detected in the mesophilic digestate. These results indicated that two digestates showed different fertilizer properties with respect to nutrient contents and PGPB, and digestates had the potential to increase the availability of phosphorus and iron in the soil, both to provide phytohormones to plant roots and protect plants from fungal phytopathogens. The contents of indicator bacteria and heavy metals were analyzed to determine their environmental risk, and the results showed a high reduction in indicator bacteria and lower levels of heavy metals than in other feedstocks.

AB  - Spanish rangelands are considered to be of high nature value and a habitat of interest in the European Union due to their productivity and species diversity. However, they are fragile landscapes where farmers' decisions, such as changes in livestock pressure, can lead to serious deterioration. Currently, no indicator system is being used in these areas to enable farmers to evaluate the condition of rangeland soils. Aiming at this, soil properties, land degradation processes, rainfall characteristics, as well as pasture and land management were analysed in order to propose a set of soil quality and degradation indicators. The study was carried out on 22 enclosures selected from 10 privately-owned farms distributed throughout the Spanish region of Extremadura. Cation exchange capacity, available potassium, soil organic matter, water content at field capacity, soil depth and the thickness of the Ah-horizon were selected as soil quality indicators, with the percentage of bare ground cover and bulk density measured from 5 to 10 cm in depth selected as soil degradation indicators. All the indicators were classified into 5 categories and land units were assessed accordingly. The results revealed that 14% of cases showed very low soil quality and 18% high degradation. The reasons that motivated the selection and categorisation of each indicator are described and the proposed system is compared with other existing indicator systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Few studies exist on phenotypic composition of the sable populations in the Russian Far East, China and Japan. We present new data on the morphological diversification of sable for 20 mainland and island populations in an effort to document existing variability and produce baseline data that would be useful in constructing phylogenies for this species. Dlinal variability of skull size, cranial phene, foramen in fossa condyloidei inferior (FFCI), and fur coloration is revealed. One district, Central Sikhote-Alin, is characterized by sables with the minimum cranial size and the maximum phene expression. The area between the Uda River and Goryun and Amgun rivers is inhabited by sables of the darkest fur coloration. Moving out from those areas in all directions we were detected a trend of increasing skull size, reduction of cranial phene, and decreasing color intensity of fur. The skull size of sable is consistent with Bergmann's rule. Special attention paid to the particular morphological properties of insular populations in specific climatic conditions and under isolation from the continent. They are characterized by minimal expression phene FFCI (Bolshoi Shantar, Iturup, and Hokkaido islands) and larger skull size, especially in sable of Kamchatka Peninsula. It is hypothesized that the area of the lower Amur Basin was a source of sable postglacial dispersal on the Eurasian Continent.

AB  - The physiological characters and growth of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were recorded to be largely affected by different levels of irrigation. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of deficit irrigation and rain shelters on sap flow, relative water content and the relationship between sap flow and environmental parameters. Experiments under rain shelters conditions were conducted in southern China during the growing seasons in 2012. The threshold of irrigation was designed at 80% field capacity during the whole period (T1, the control), and 30%, 40% and 50% decreased water of T1 were applied as the treatments of T2, T3 and T4. The plants subjected to water stress exhibited a decrease in the values of sap flow rate and relative water content. Calculation of 95% confidence level revealed a significant difference of sap flow rate in T4 and T3 as well as the control on sunny and rainy days. The diurnal variation of the sap flow showed a single peak curve on sunny day, while it demonstrated irregular multi-peak variation on rainy days. The study also showed that the most sensitive environmental indicator affecting sap flow was solar radiation, followed by air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Direct path coefficient was basically consistent with the coefficient of correlation, but there was slight difference between the total contribution R-2 and that of variable factors.

AB  - Although recent studies show that human wellbeing on global and national scales is improving, it is important to monitor the regional progress of human wellbeing and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Here we provide an assessment of human wellbeing in the south-west coastal part of Bangladesh by analysing Household Expenditure Survey (HIES) and Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data from 1995 to 2010. Indicators have been selected based on the five dimensions of human wellbeing, including health, material condition, personal security and freedom of choice and actions. This study shows that the south-west coastal region has made commendable progress in meeting the target MGDs goal for 'child and maternal health'. However, the areas of 'personal security' and 'freedom of choice and action' have not achieved the target MDGs despite showing substantial progress for 'poverty alleviation' (17%), 'sanitation coverage' (40%) and 'education' (23%). Incomes from fishery and 'non -ecosystem' based livelihood have increased 76% and 8% respectively, whereas income from shrimp and agriculture show declining trends. Production costs have increased substantially since 1995 in response to a rise in GDP. At a household level, proxy indicators of provisioning services, such as crop production, are positively correlated with poverty alleviation. Overall, greater attention on education and sustainable land use is required if Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are to be achieved by 2030. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lasalocid is a veterinary ionophore antibiotic used for prevention and treatment of coccidiosis in poultry. It is excreted from the treated animals mostly in its active form and enters the environment with the use of contaminated manure on agricultural land. To properly assess the risk that lasalocid poses to the environment, it is necessary to know its environmental concentrations as well as the rates of its degradation in manure and dissipation in soil. These values are still largely unknown. A research was undertaken to ascertain the rate of lasalocid degradation in manure under different storage conditions (aging in a pile or composting) and on agricultural soil after using lasalocid-contaminated manure. The results have shown that there is considerable difference in lasalocid degradation between aging manure with no treatment (t(1/2) = 61.8 +/- 1.7 d) and composting (t(1/2) = 17.5 +/- 0.8 d). Half-lives in soil are much shorter (on average 3.1 +/- 0.4 d). On the basis of the measured concentrations of lasalocid in soil after manure application, we can conclude that it can potentially be harmful to soil organisms (PEC/PNEC ratio of 1.18), but only in a worst-case scenario of using the maximum permissible amount of manure and immediately after application. To make certain that no harmful effects occur, composting is recommended. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Severe allergic reactions of unknown etiology, necessitating a hospital visit, have an important impact in the life of affected individuals and impose a major economic burden to societies. The prediction of clinically severe allergic reactions would be of great importance, but current attempts have been limited by the lack of a well-founded applicable methodology and the wide spatiotemporal distribution of allergic reactions. The valid prediction of severe allergies (and especially those needing hospital treatment) in a region, could alert health authorities and implicated individuals to take appropriate preemptive measures. In the present report we have collecterd visits for serious allergic reactions of unknown etiology from two major hospitals in the island of Crete, for two distinct time periods (validation and test sets). We have used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a satellite-based, freely available measurement, which is an indicator of live green vegetation at a given geographic area, and a set of meteorological data to develop a model capable of describing and predicting severe allergic reaction frequency. Our analysis has retained NDVI and temperature as accurate identifiers and predictors of increased hospital severe allergic reactions visits. Our approach may contribute towards the development of satellite-based modules, for the prediction of severe allergic reactions in specific, well-defined geographical areas. It could also probably be used for the prediction of other environment related diseases and conditions.

AB  - Serpentine (ultramafic) soils are extremely stressful environments for plant growth due to macronutrient deficiency (N, P, K, Ca), macronutrient toxicity (Mg; extremely high Mg:Ca ratio), and micronutrient toxicity (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn), as well as toxicity of other heavy metals (Al, Cr, Co). Serpentine soils are also often shallow, rocky, and susceptible to drought. As a result of extreme adverse physical and chemical conditions, serpentine soils support a high proportion of endemic plant species that are adapted to their harsh environment. We analysed root, stem, and leaf tissue element concentrations (Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) of Halacsya sendtneri (Boraginaceae; strict serpentine endemic), Cheilanthes marantae (Pteridaceac; broad serpentine endemic/strong indicator), and Seseli rigidum (Apiaccac; weak serpentine indicator/indifferent) growing on serpentine and limestone in Serbia. Element bioaccumulation factor was calculated as the ratio of plant tissue clement concentration to soil plant-available element concentration. Tissue concentrations of Ca and Mg for H. sendtneri and S. rigidum indicate that the species selectively uptake and translocatc Ca to leaves, relative to Mg, to maintain adequate tissue Mg:Ca ratio. C. marantae did not exhibit selective Ca uptake or translocation, but did exhibit Mg sequestration in roots. Heavy metal exclusion and sequestration were the primary physiological tolerance mechanisms conveying serpentine tolerance in the three species. S. rigidum exhibited divergence into serpentine tolerant and limestone tolerant ecotypes, presenting a useful model species for further studies of physiological adaptation to chemically extreme soils.

AB  - The objective of our study was to confirm if hydraulic lift (HL) promotes nutrient uptake in field-grown plants in the same way as demonstrated previously in pot-grown plants.
   We conducted a field experiment in an agroforestry system, over an entire growing season that included a dry period and a wet period. We used a shallow-root crop plant, mung bean (Vigna radiata L.), intercropped with walnut (Juglans regia L.) and jujube (Zizyphus jujube Mill.), as an indicator for the presence of HL and its effects on nutrient uptake. To monitor HL, we artificially applied deuterium isotope to the deep roots of trees.
   We demonstrated the presence of a natural nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium gradient along the soil depth, and the occurrence of HL, evidenced by deuterium signature in the shallow soil layers and V. radiata stem, only during the dry season. J. regia and Z. jujube both had deep root systems, but the former species exhibited stronger HL to the shallow soil than the latter. Meanwhile, the upper soil layers of J. regia had significantly higher moisture content, and the intercropped V. radiata had higher nutrient content.
   HL can facilitate water uptake by V. radiata from the upper soil layers in the field condition during the dry season, which relates to nutrient acquisition by the crop.

AB  - The light-driven outward proton transporter assists energy production via an ATP synthase system best exemplified by the bacteriorhodopsin (BR) from Halobacterium salinarum, HsBR. As the only archaea able to survive in the resource-limited ecosystem of the Dead Sea, Haloarcula marismortui has been reported to have a unique dual-BR system, consisting of HmBRI and HmBRII, instead of only a single BR in a cell (solo-BR). The contribution of this dual-BR system to survival was investigated. First, native H.marismortui and H.salinarum cells were tested in water that had been adjusted to mimic the conditions of Dead Sea water. These archaea were shown to accumulate protons and reduce pH in their periplasmic regions, which disabled further proton transportation functionality in H.salinarum but not in H.marismortui. Then, pH-dependent photocurrent measurements using purified BR proteins demonstrated that HsBR and HmBRI were functional at pH>5.0 and that HmBRII was functional at pH>4.0. Our results indicate that the dual-HmBR system is composed of two BRs with different optimal functional pH ranges and together they maintain light-driven proton transport activity under pH>4.0, which might contribute the survival of H.marismortui under the acidic pH of the Dead Sea.

AB  - A wide variety of data analysis techniques have been applied for quantitative assessment of coastal marine eutrophication. Indicators for assessing eutrophication and frequency distributions have been used to develop scales for characterizing oligotrophy and eutrophication. Numerical classification has also contributed to the assessment of eutrophic trends by grouping sampling sites of similar trophic conditions. Applications of eutrophication assessment based on Principal Component Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling have also been carried out. In addition, the rapid development of Geographical Information Systems has provided the framework for applications of spatial methods and mapping techniques on eutrophication studies. Satellite data have also contributed to eutrophication assessment especially at large scale. Multiple criteria analysis methods can integrate eutrophication variables together with socio-economic parameters providing a holistic approach particularly useful to policy makers. As the current concept of eutrophication problems is to be examined as part of a coastal management approach, more complex quantitative procedures are needed to provide a platform useful for implementation of environmental policy. The present work reviews methods of data analysis used for the assessment of coastal marine eutrophication. The difficulties in applying these methods on data collected from the marine environment are discussed as well as the future perspectives of spatial and multiple criteria choice methods.

AB  - Researchers who have studied the living conditions of Roma (Gypsy) communities since the collapse of state socialism in Eastern Europe tend to emphasise two dimensions of the growing degree of social exclusion of the Roma: the economic dimension (the decline in socio-economic status) and the spatial dimension (the growing levels of residential segregation). This article aims to study how spatial exclusion and involuntary residential segregation 'function', that is, how they operate on the social micro level as a 'generator' of social and economic disadvantage. Certain types of objective obstacles arise in the living environment of excluded people and they continuously have to overcome these obstacles on an everyday basis. The author analyses how spatial exclusion acts on the excluded by requiring relatively high expenditures of money and time for them to overcome exclusion. He then examines the infrastructural dimensions of spatial exclusion, describing infrastructural exclusion as a dimension of disadvantage in which the excluded have limited access to infrastructures and through them resources otherwise commonly accessible in the dominant socio-economic system. Access to these infrastructures and resources can be regarded as an indicator of social integration and as an essential precondition for equal and meaningful social and economic participation in the life of the dominant socio-economic system. In conclusion, the author discusses the conflicting or almost contradictory relationship between the generation of spatial and infrastructural exclusion on the one hand and social integration projects on the other.

AB  - Thirty species of 10 ostracod genera were identified from 440 fossil specimens isolated through the hot acetolysis of the rock samples collected across the Permian-Triassic boundary at Chongyang section. Twenty species of 6 genera are found to occur in the limestone of Changxing Formation, and 11 species of 7 genera above the main faunal mass extinction horizon. The ostracod assemblages identified at the Chongyang section are obviously different from those previously reported in the contemporaneous microbialites in Guangxi and Chongqing regions, not only in the ostracod components but also in the abundance of filter-feeding ostracods relative to the deposit-feeding ostracods, an indicator of the oxygen level of the seawater. This spatial difference in ostracod assemblages might reflect the diversity of oceanic environmental conditions after the end-Permian mass extinction. Ostracods disappear at 200 cm below and near the main mass extinction horizon, and on the top of the microbialites, respectively, showing an episodic and gradual collapse process at the Chongyang section. The carbon isotope composition is found to appear at 200 cm below the main mass extinction horizon, indicating the initial deterioration of oceanic environment. Fluctuation of the carbon isotope composition is obviously related with the episodic evolution of ostracod species, but not with the abundance of ostracods.

AB  - Incubation of intact and oxidized alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) in anaerobic sediment slurries allowed us to demonstrate that, as previously suggested by Goossens et al. (1984), the degradation of alpha-tocopherol in anoxic sediments results in the formation of pristane. The conversion of alpha-tocopherol to this isoprenoid alkane involves a combination of biotic and abiotic degradative processes, i.e. the anaerobic biodegradation (which seems to be mainly induced by denitrifying bacteria) of trimeric structures resulting from the abiotic oxidation of a-tocopherol. On the basis of the results obtained, it is proposed that in the marine environment most of the alpha-tocopherol present in phytoplanktonic cells should be quickly degraded within the water column and the oxic zone of sediments by way of aerobic biodegradation, photo- and autoxidation processes. Abiotic transformation of this compound mainly results in the production of trimeric oxidation products, sufficiently stable to be incorporated into anoxic sediments and whose subsequent anaerobic bacterial degradation affords pristane. These results confirm that the ratio pristane to phytane cannot be used as an indicator of the oxicity of the environment of deposition; in contrast, they support the use of PFI (Pristane Formation Index) as a proxy for the state of diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter.

AB  - Introduction: Clinical environmental medicine deals with environmental effects on human health in individual patients. Patients seek medical advice for problems of many different kinds that may be due to environmental exposures; such exposures must be considered carefully along with other potential causes. An environmental medical assessment should include thorough medical history-taking and physical examination, the formulation of a differential diagnosis, and (whenever indicated) human biomonitoring, site inspections, and ambient monitoring.
   Methods: This review of clinically relevant environment-related health disturbances is based on a selective evaluation of the pertinent literature and of own experiences.
   Results: Overall, relevant environmental exposures can be identified in up to 15% of patients who attribute their health complaints to environmental factors. (Clinical disorders are more common and more severe in these patients.) 40% to 75% are found to suffer from other physical and/or emotional conditions without any specific environmental aspect, i.e., without any apparent or verifiable exposure.
   Discussion: Despite the relative rarity of verifiable environmentally related health disturbances, these must be clearly identified and delimited to avoid further harmful exposures. Environmental medical counseling should include risk assessment and behavior recommendations for all patients who attribute their medical problems to their environment. Physicians performing specific environmental-medical diagnostic procedures must be aware of their limitations in order to avoid performing tests whose results have no therapeutic consequences and are thus of no help to either the physician or the patient.

AB  - 1. In searching for biological evidence that essential hypertension is caused by chronic mental stress, a disputed proposition, parallels are noted with panic disorder, which provides an explicit clinical model of recurring stress responses.
   2. There is clinical comorbidity; panic disorder prevalence is increased threefold in essential hypertension. Plasma cortisol is elevated in both.
   3. In panic disorder and essential hypertension, but not in health, single sympathetic nerve fibres commonly fire repeatedly within an individual cardiac cycle; this appears to be a signature of stress exposure. For both conditions, adrenaline cotransmission is present in sympathetic nerves.
   4. Tissue nerve growth factor is increased in both (nerve growth factor is a stress reactant). There is induction of the adrenaline synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, in sympathetic nerves, an explicit indicator of mental stress exposure.
   5. The question of whether chronic mental stress causes high blood pressure, still hotly debated, has been reviewed by an Australian Government body, the Specialist Medical Review Council. Despite the challenging medicolegal implications, the Council determined that stress is one proven cause of hypertension, this ruling being published in the 27 March 2002 Australian Government Gazette. This judgement was reached after consideration of the epidemiological evidence, but in particular after review of the specific elements of the neural pathophysiology of essential hypertension, described above.

AB  - This paper reports on a Participatory Learning and Action Research (PLAR) process that was initiated in three villages in eastern Uganda in September 1999 to enable small-scale farmers to reverse nutrient depletion of their soils profitably by increasing their capacity to develop, adapt and use integrated natural resource management strategies. The PLAR process was also used to improve the participatory skills and tools of research and extension personnel to support this process. The farming systems of the area were characterised for socio-economic and biophysical conditions that included social organisations, wealth categories, gender, crop, soil, agro forestry and livestock production. Farmers identified soil fertility constraints, their indicators, and causes of soil fertility decline, and suggested strategies to address the problem of soil fertility decline. Soil fertility management diversity among households indicated that most farmers were not carrying out any improved soil fertility management practices, despite previous research and dissemination in the area. Following the diagnosis stage and exposure visits to other farmer groups working on integrated soil fertility projects, the farmers designed 11 experiments for on-farm testing. One hundred and twenty farmers then chose, for participatory technology development, sub-sets of these 11 experiments, based on the major agricultural constraints and the potential solutions identified and prioritised by the farmers. Quantitative and qualitative results from the testing, farmer evaluation and adaptation, training, dissemination strategies and socio-economic implications of these technologies are discussed. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aquatic sediments accumulate heavy metals that are discharged into the environment. This study investigates possible water quality changes due to release of heavy metals such as Cd, Ni, Zn and Pb into the water column during dredging of anoxic sediments in the Old Harbour of Montreal. An environmental impact assessment of the sediment removal requires estimating the speciation of heavy metals in the water column with and without the solid phase. Chemical equilibria in the St. Lawrence River water are calculated using the program EQUILIB from the software FACT. Results show that the water is oversaturated with respect to CaMg(CO3)(2) and Fe(OH)(3). It is speculated that (ZnO)(Fe2O3) and (NiO)(Fe2O3) control the solubility of Zn and Ni in the water. The speciation of heavy metals in pore water of anoxic sediments is calculated, taking into account that the corresponding sulfides are solid phases and control their solubility. The impact of various scenarios on the area of concern is reviewed from an ecotoxicological perspective. Dredging might change the redox and acid-base conditions in the water column. Dredging can lead to an increase in the concentration of heavy metals in the water column and a change of metal speciation, but its impact will be less visible if the sediments contain high levels of calcium acting as a buffer.

AB  - Coeliac disease may remain undiagnosed because of the non-specific nature of the presenting symptoms. Several antibody tests are claimed as markers for this condition but a direct comparison of the available tests has not been reported.
   The probands and healthy first-degree relatives of 42 families with coeliac disease were studied. Histological examination of biopsy specimens revealed jejunal mucosal villous atrophy compatible with coeliac disease in 13 of 122 relatives. Reticulin-antibody-positive relatives with or without jejunal mucosal atrophy were genetically similar to the probands of the families (DR3 gene frequencies 55.3%-60.0%). Gliadin-antibody-positive relatives with normal mucosa were genetically different from the probands (DR3 gene frequency 16.7% versus 55.3%). IgA reticulin and endomysium antibodies detected 92.3% of subjects with silent coeliac disease. The only case that was missed had selective IgA deficiency and was positive for IgG-class reticulin antibodies. By contrast, gliadin antibodies detected only half of the cases. Follow-up of the 7 reticulin-antibody-positive relatives with normal mucosa revealed 2 further cases of coeliac disease and 1 of dermatitis herpetiformis during the next three years.
   Our family study shows that healthy reticulin-antibody-positive first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients, irrespective of the state of the jejunal mucosa, are genetically similar to known coeliac disease patients. Reticulin-antibody positivity is an indicator of both silent and latent coeliac disease.

AB  - Relationships between machine smoking nicotine yield and different smoke exposure indicators were investigated in a cross-sectional study. For each of the four yield classes H (1.0-1.2 mg), M (0.7-0.9 mg), L (0.4-0.6 mg) and U (0.1-0.3 mg) 18 male and 18 female subjects were recruited. The experimental design (2 x 2) included smoking with lip contact or with a flowmeter holder, natural smoking of one cigarette or forced smoking (30 puffs). The analysis of presmoking measures revealed for plasma nicotine H > L,U; M > U, for plasma cotinine H,M > U, and no differences for respiratory CO. Pre- to postsmoking boosts of CO and nicotine increased with yield, but the differences were smaller than those in yield. This partial compensation can be attributed to puffing behavior as revealed by the differences between yield classes with respect to flowmeter measures (puff volume, flow parameters, number of puffs). Contact condition hardly influenced the results. Forced puffing revealed down regulation mechanisms in smoke absorption and, less pronounced, in puffing behavior. Cardiovascular and subjective effects were widely independent of yield. Plasma cotinine appeared as the best smoke exposure indicator, due both to its high retest reliability and its relationship to nicotine yield.

AB  - Animal manure is the main source of bioenergy production by anaerobic digestion (AD). However, the pathogenic bacteria in manure may pose a high risk to human health by contaminating the environment if not effectively inactivated during AD. Worldwide, more than 20,000 biogas plants are running for the treatment of animal manure. AD has been playing the important role in establishing a circular economy in the agricultural sector and may contribute to the United Nations sustainable development goal (UN SDG). Nevertheless, whether AD is a reliable approach for pathogens inactivation has been challenged. A comprehensive understanding of the coping mechanisms of pathogens with adverse conditions and the challenges of establishing the AD process to inactivate effectively pathogens are yet to be analyzed. In this review, the diversity and resistance of pathogens in animal manure are summarized. The efficiencies and the difficulties of their inactivations in AD are also analyzed. In particular, three forms of pathogens i.e. sporing-forming pathogens, viable but non-culturable (VBNC) pathogens, and persistent pathogens are discussed. The factors influencing the pathogens' inactivation and AD efficiencies are analyzed. The trade-off between energy production and pathogens inactivation in an AD system was consequently pointed out. This review concluded that the development of anaerobic processes should meet the goals of high efficient bioenergy production and deep hygienization.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) monoculture contributes to soil degradation. Intensification of soybean-based sequences through polyculture, cover crops (CC), and crop fertilization can enhance soil physical quality and help mitigate its degradation. We assessed the effect of intensification practices in cropping sequences with soybean predominance on soil physical quality indicators in contrasting soils. Treatments included soybean monoculture with and without phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) fertilization, CC/PS-fertilized soybean, nitrogen (N)-fertilized CC/PS-fertilized soybean and NPS-fertilized crop rotation including wheat, corn, soybean and CC. Four long-term experiments (10 yr) were established in sites with contrasting edaphoclimatic conditions, and initial soil organic carbon (SOC), where we evaluated bulk density (BD) and aggregate stability (AS). The BD was mostly unaffected by treatments, whereas AS responded to intensification practices at all sites, increasing over 50% as compared with soybean monoculture. Differences in BD and AS among sites were mostly explained by soil texture and initial SOC. On the contrary, AS differences among treatments were not driven by texture, but by the soil degradation at the beginning of the experiments (calculated as the ratio between SOC when experiments were established and the SOC of pristine soil). Therefore, regardless of soil texture, more degraded soils responded to a greater extent to intensification practices in soybean-based rotations.

AB  - Efficiency of circular economies is one of the most important areas of the improvement of economic growth in a circular way, that is, improving worldwide GDP. The issue of circular economies, namely their efficiency, is a current topic of evidence of many literary sources in the literature. This issue is solved in the conditions of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. The goal of the study is to compare the circular efficiency within the Visegrad Group and efficiency of Visegrad Group countries to the European Union 28 average. Data envelopment analysis slack-based models are implemented to evaluate the output efficiencies of the selected subjects. Truncated regression is used to measure the impact of selected indicators on circular efficiency. The Visegrad Group countries are not among the most advanced in terms of recycling and the use of the circular economy, which was confirmed by this research. However, developments suggest significant improvements. The significance of this research lies in several benefits. One of the benefits is the perception of regional differences and the setting of EU cluster policies at the regional level. The idea of changing inputs is very significant since the outputs are oriented to the recycling rates of materials and waste. This research has shown that a higher level of GDP does not necessarily mean a higher level of efficiency of the circular economy.

AB  - Enhancing the environmental performance of production processes is currently a major issue. To propose efficient processes both in terms of productivity and environmental impacts, it is necessary to develop multi-objective optimization tools. Such an approach was developed in this study for an ultrasound-assisted extraction process, aiming at val-orizing antioxidant polyphenols from downgraded beetroot seeds (agri-food by-product). Environmental impacts of the process (assessed using LCA), as well as classical productivity indicators (extraction yield, antioxidant activity of the extract, energy consumption) were all predicted in function of the varied process parameters (extraction time, solvent composition, solvent/beetroot seeds ratio, ultrasound power density). The proposed multi-criteria optimization tool allowed to predict optimal operating conditions in function of specific constraints, such as maximization of extraction yield and/or minimization of extraction time, energy consumption and/or environmental impacts. Maximal polyphenols concentration (2.8 g.L-1 GAE) and antioxidant activity (16.6 mM TEAC) were obtained after 120 min with 65% ethanol in the solvent, ultrasound power density of 667 W.L-1, and ratio of 5 mL.g-1. Ultrasounds assistance allowed extraction yield enhancement (up to 60%) of and process duration decrease (8 times), without degrading environmental performance. The original proposed methodology could easily be adapted for multi-criteria optimization of other processes. (c) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Endothelial cells are important constituents of blood vessels that play critical roles in cardiovascular homeostasis by regulating blood fluidity and fibrinolysis, vascular tone, angiogenesis, monocyte/leukocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation. The normal vascular endothelium is taken as a gatekeeper of cardiovascular health, whereas abnormality of vascular endothelium is a major contributor to a plethora of cardiovascular ailments, such as atherosclerosis, aging, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by imbalanced vasodilation and vasoconstriction, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and proinflammatory factors, as well as deficiency of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. The occurrence of endothelial dysfunction disrupts the endothelial barrier permeability that is a part of inflammatory response in the development of cardiovascular diseases. As such, abrogation of endothelial cell activation/inflammation is of clinical relevance. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an entry as a gasotransmitter, exerts diverse biological effects through acting on various targeted signaling pathways. Within the cardiovascular system, the formation of H2S is detected in smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes. Disrupted H2S bioavailability is postulated to be a new indicator for endothelial cell inflammation and its associated endothelial dysfunction. In this review, we will summarize recent advances about the roles of H2S in endothelial cell homeostasis, especially under pathological conditions, and discuss its putative therapeutic applications in endothelial inflammation-associated cardiovascular disorders.

AB  - Symptoms of Fusarium crown rot of wheat include premature death of inflorescens (whiteheads), lesions on subcrown internodes, and rotting of crown tissue and lower stem internodes. Each symptom type is influenced by a different set of environmental conditions. Whiteheads are the easiest symptom to quantify and are frequently reported in the Pacific Northwest U.S.A. The objective of this research was to examine factors associated with whitehead expression and relationships with wheat yield and test weight. Incidence of whiteheads differed for inoculations with different isolates of F. pseudograminearum and F. culmorum, and over years due to weather factors. Whiteheads became less as planting dates for winter wheat were delayed until after September, and incidence was increased with increasing nitrogen application rate. Dates of initial and greatest expression of whiteheads differed among cultivars, which was associated in part with the cultivar heading date. Whiteheads were not correlated with subcrown intemode lesions or browning of crown tissue. Whiteheads were also not correlated with grain test weight. White heads were sometimes negatively associated with grain yield, but that relationship was variable and could not be considered a reliable, recurrent, or accurate measure of crown rot severity. These results indicate the need for caution in reporting whiteheads as a sole indicator of cultivar susceptibility to Fusarium crown rot.

AB  - Anthropogenic impact over the Pasvik River (Arctic Norway) is mainly caused by emissions from runoff from smelter and mine wastes, as well as by domestic sewage from the Russian, Norwegian, and Finnish settlements situated on its catchment area. In this study, sediment samples from sites within the Pasvik River area with different histories of metal input were analyzed for metal contamination and occurrence of metal-resistant bacteria in late spring and summer of 2014. The major differences in microbial and chemical parameters were mostly dependent on local inputs than seasonality. Higher concentrations of metals were generally detected in July rather than May, with inner stations that became particularly enriched in Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn, but without significant differences. Bacterial resistance to metals, which resulted from viable counts on amended agar plates, was in the order Ni2+>Pb2+>Co2+>Zn2+>Cu2+>Cd2+>Hg2+, with higher values that were generally determined at inner stations. Among a total of 286 bacterial isolates (mainly achieved from Ni- and Pb-amended plates), the 7.2% showed multiresistance at increasing metal concentration (up to 10,000ppm). Selected multiresistant isolates belonged to the genera Stenotrophomonas, Arthrobacter, and Serratia. Results highlighted that bacteria, rapidly responding to changing conditions, could be considered as true indicators of the harmful effect caused by contaminants on human health and environment and suggested their potential application in bioremediation processes of metal-polluted cold sites.

AB  - Molards have been defined in the past as conical mounds of debris that can form part of a landslide's deposits. We present the first conclusive evidence that molards in permafrost terrains are cones of loose debris that result from thawing of frozen blocks of ice-rich sediments mobilised by a landslide, and hence propose a rigorous definition of this landform in permafrost environments. We show that molards can be used as an indicator of permafrost degradation, and that their morphometry and spatial distribution give valuable insights into landslide dynamics in permafrost environments. We demonstrate that molards are readily recognisable not only in the field, but also in remote sensing data; surveys of historic aerial imagery allow the recognition of relict molards, which can be used as an indicator of current and past permafrost conditions. The triggering of landslides as a result of permafrost degradation will arguably occur more often as global atmospheric temperatures increase, so molards should be added to our armoury for tracking climate change, as well as helping us to understand landslide-related hazards. Finally, we have also identified candidate molards on Mars, so molards can inform about landscape evolution on Earth and other planetary bodies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cotton (Gossypium sp.) is a major crop grown under rainfed conditions in Vertisols and associated soils in semi-arid tropical (SAT) regions of Peninsular India. In recent years, cotton productivity has declined due to various biophysical factors including pest and diseases, seasonal water stress soil degradation and poor crop management practices. In this study, we compare two methods for evaluating the suitability of Vertisols for cotton in contrasting two agro-ecological regions viz., sub-humid moist (SHM) region and semi-arid dry(SAD) were characterized. Twelve cotton growing Vertisols (seven from SHM and five from SAD) were evaluated for their suitability for cotton cultivation using soil quality index (SQI) and modified Sys-FAO method. SQIs were calculated using the weighted additive index from transformed scores of selected indicators by principal component analysis. For Sys-FAO method both biophysical and soil characteristics were considered for suitability evaluation. We found that the soils of SHM region were moderately suitable for cotton cultivation with soil moisture as the major limiting factor, whereas the soils of SAD region are marginally suitable due to high exchangeable sodium percentage and poor hydraulic conductivity. From this, it may be concluded that the weighted SQI has better agreement with the cotton yield.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to produce biosurfactants using three bacterial strains (Pseudomonas cepacia CCT6659, Bacillus methylotrophicus UCP 1616 and Bacillus cereus UCP 1615) cultivated in mineral medium containing different carbon (glucose, sucrose, molasses and waste frying oil) and nitrogen [NH4NO3, (NH4)(2)SO4, peptone, yeast extract and corn steep liquor] sources. B. cereus stood out as the best biosurfactant producer when inoculated with a 1.5% cell suspension and cultivated at 28 degrees C and 200 rpm in 2.0% molasses and 1.0% corn steep liquor for 48 h. Under these conditions, medium surface tension was reduced to 26.2 +/- 0.2 mN/m, and biosurfactant concentration achieved 2.05 +/- 0.32 g/L. The biosurfactant showed a critical micelle concentration of 0.90 +/- 0.05 g/L, proved to be highly stable in wide ranges of pH, salt concentration and heating temperature, and exerted low toxicity to larvae of Artemia salina as a marine environmental bioindicator. Structural characterisation of biosurfactant suggested a lipopeptide composition. The biotensioactive agent was shown to effectively remove motor oil adsorbed to marine rock (91.0 +/- 0.4%) and to disperse it in seawater (70.0 +/- 0.4%). The biosurfactant formulated with 0.2% potassium sorbate demonstrated considerable potential for application in the petroleum industry, where it could be successfully used as a commercial product to mobilize oil in marine environments.

AB  - The extent of residual contaminations of pesticides through drift, run-off and leaching is a potential threat to non-target plant communities. Arabidopsis thaliana responds to low doses of the herbicide atrazine, and of its degradation products, desethylatrazine and hydroxyatrazine, not only in the long term, but also under conditions of short-term exposure. In order to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of low-dose responses and to decipher commonalities and specificities between different chemical treatments, parallel transcriptomic studies of the early effects of the atrazine-desethylatrazine-hydroxyatrazine chemical series were undertaken using whole-genome microarrays. All of the triazines under study produced coordinated and specific changes in gene expression. Hydroxyatrazine-responsive genes were mainly linked to root development, whereas atrazine and desethylatrazine mostly affected molecular signaling networks implicated in stress and hormone responses. Analysis of signaling-related genes, promoter sites and shared-function interaction networks highlighted the involvement of energy-, stress-, abscisic acid- and cytokinin-regulated processes, and emphasized the importance of cold-, heat- and drought-related signaling in the perception of low doses of triazines. These links between low-dose xenobiotic impacts and stress-hormone crosstalk pathways give novel insights into plant-pesticide interactions and plant-pollution interactions that are essential for toxicity evaluation in the context of environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Bed sediment resuspension is a potential source of faecal microorganisms in the water column of estuaries. As such, it is important to identify the survival of faecal microorganisms in these bed sediments and understand how bed sediment resuspension impacts the quality of estuarine waters. This study explores the effect of bed sediment resuspension on Escherichia coli concentrations in the water column and the persistence of E.coli in the water column and bed sediments of the Yarra River estuary in South-Eastern Australia. Using sediment cores, we identified that the resuspension of both surficial sediments (e.g., by tidal movements) and deeper bed sediments (e.g., by large storm events) can increase E.coli concentrations in the water column by up to 20 times in estuaries in oceanic climates. Bed sediment resuspension can result in increased E.coli concentrations in the water column even up to 24days after E.coli first enters the estuarine water. This study demonstrates that faecal microorganisms, such as E.coli, can persist for extended periods in estuarine bed sediments, which may then be re-entrained into the water column via recreational activities, high flow events, or tidal fluctuations. If the survival and resuspension processes observed here hold true for pathogenic microorganisms, the resuspension of bed sediments may indeed represent an increased public health risk.

AB  - The factors associated with severity of the bicycle crashes may differ across different bicycle crash patterns. Therefore, it is important to identify distinct bicycle crash patterns with homogeneous attributes. The current study aimed at identifying subgroups of bicycle crashes in Italy and analyzing separately the different bicycle crash types. The present study focused on bicycle crashes that occurred in Italy during the period between 2011 and 2013. We analyzed categorical indicators corresponding to the characteristics of infrastructure (road type, road signage, and location type), road user (i.e., opponent vehicle and cyclist's maneuver, type of collision, age and gender of the cyclist), vehicle (type of opponent vehicle), and the environmental and time period variables (time of the day, day of the week, season, pavement condition, and weather). To identify homogenous subgroups of bicycle crashes, we used latent class analysis. Using latent class analysis, the bicycle crash data set was segmented into 19 classes, which represents 19 different bicycle crash types. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between class membership and severity of the bicycle crashes. Finally, association rules were conducted for each of the latent classes to uncover the factors associated with an increased likelihood of severity. Association rules highlighted different crash characteristics associated with an increased likelihood of severity for each of the 19 bicycle crash types.

AB  - The incorporation of phase change materials (PCMs) into building elements is an effective technique that has been gaining momentum in the construction industry for achieving reductions in the energy consumption of buildings. The operation of PCM-incorporated building elements has been widely proven experimentally; however fundamental problems are encountered when it comes to its numerical simulation, where non-linear phenomena that change in time and space also have to be considered. This paper reviews the existing literature on the numerical simulation of PCMs for building applications, and identifies the basic parameters that are required to be taken into account for conducting the numerical simulation of PCM-incorporated building systems. These parameters include the geometry and discretization of the simulated PCM-incorporated building system, the physics of heat transfer embracing thermophysical properties and heat transfer mechanisms, and boundary conditions to be considered for the numerical simulation, and the implementation of experimental validation studies. The focus of this paper is to provide evidence for the significance of considering heat convection to the calculation of the thermal performance of PCM. In view of the findings of the literature review, numerical studies for a building wall incorporating PCM are conducted. The results of the simulation studies assess the impact and emphasize the importance of accounting for natural convection within the liquid PCM in numerical simulation studies.

AB  - Risso's dolphins are known for the persistency of their natural markings, possibly due to the loss of pigment during the healing process of skin wounds. Nonetheless, the actual longevity and reliability of each mark type has never been assessed. In this paper, we used photographs to investigate the etiology of skin marks in the species, analyze their distribution and temporal variability, and discuss implications for photo identification. Nineteen mark types were described on the dorsal fin of Risso's dolphin, including 2 new to the literature: the snakelike mark and the protruding fat. Longevity of skin marks ranged from 6 years for the protruding fat to several decades for scrapes and dots. Persistent and reliable marks were notch, tooth-rake, and thick single and parallel scrapes. Mark change was sufficiently low that all mark types could be used for photo identification, provided that backlit or underexposed images were discarded as photographs taken under suboptimal light conditions proved to be unreliable. Finally, mark distribution and variability were unequal between age classes; juveniles were less marked and showed a higher rate of mark change than older individuals so that, even if they possessed enough notches to be classified as reliably marked, they could be confidently matched over a time interval of up to 3 years.

AB  - Online condition assessment of the power system devices and apparatus is considered vital for robust operation, where partial discharge (PD) detection is employed as a diagnosis tool. PD measurements, however, are corrupted with different types of noises such as white noise, random noise, and discrete spectral interferences. Hence, the denoising of such corrupted PD signals remains a challenging problem in PD signal detection and classification. The challenge lies in removing these noises from the online PD signal measurements effectively, while retaining its discriminant features and characteristics. In this paper, wavelet-based denoising with a new histogram-based threshold function and selection rule is proposed. The proposed threshold estimation technique obtains two different threshold values for each wavelet sub-band and uses a prodigious thresholding function that conserves the original signal energy. Moreover, two signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation techniques are derived to fit with actual PD signals corrupted with real noise. The proposed technique is applied on different acoustic and current measured PD signals to examine its performance under different noisy environments. The simulation results confirm the merits of the proposed denoising technique compared with other existing wavelet-based techniques by measuring four evaluation metrics: 1) SNR; 2) cross-correlation coefficient; 3) mean square error; and 4) reduction in noise level.

AB  - This study examined the influences of calcium and bicarbonate ions on the performance of poly(vinylidene fluoride)-supported nano zero-valent iron (PSN) for metronidazole (MNZ) removal. The presence of Ca2+ and HCO3-, whether in their individual or collective forms with low or high levels, exerted differing degrees of inhibitions to MNZ removal by PSN, but these inhibitions were insignificant. Adding some other inorganic ions (i.e., NH4+, SO42-, Mg2+, PO43-, and NO3-) into MNZ solutions also caused suppressive effects and their inhibitive ability generally followed the order: NH4+ > SO42- > Mg2+ > PO43- > NO3-. Humic acid (HA) was found to introduce relatively larger inhibition to MNZ removal by PSN, whether in its single presence in MNZ solutions or in its coexistence forms with Ca2+ or HCO3- in MNZ solutions. The interaction of Ca2+, HCO3- and HA with iron (oxy)hydroxides on PSN surface might contribute to these adverse impacts on PSN-MNZ reaction system. It was noteworthy that, even with 20 mg/L HA in MNZ solutions where high levels of Ca2+ and HCO3- were introduced, the MNZ removal by PSN was still above 73.37%. Results reported herein indicated the potential of using PSN to pretreat antibiotic wastewaters in complex environmental conditions. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - This article suggests a detailed comparison of 7 working pairs intended for use in solar adsorption cooling systems. The performance analysis was based on two indicators: adsorption capacity and solar coefficient of performance. Based on a reformed form of the Dubinin-Astakhov equation, a 3D graph was constructed to show the adsorbate concentration in the appropriate adsorbent as a first step to determine the adsorption capacity. A MATLAB program was developed to solve the system equation to predict the solar coefficient of performance for a typical summer day in a Moroccan city Fez. It was found that maximal adsorption capacity is obtained by activated carbon fibre/methanol (0.3406 kg kg(-1)) followed by activated carbon/methanol (0.2565 kg kg(-1)) and activated carbon/ethanol (0.2008 kg kg(-1)). At a condenser temperature of 25 degrees C, with an adsorbent mass of 20 kg, and an integrated collector-reactor configuration, the couple silica gel/water for air conditioning purpose can reach an SCOP of 0.3843. Activated carbon fibre/methanol is the following more efficient couple and can be used in the different cooling applications with an SCOP ranging from 0.1726 to 0.3287.
   Furthermore, adequate indicators are evaluated addressing the economic, environmental and safe aspects associated with each working pair. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The deep-sea floor is increasingly subject to anthropogenic impacts. Consequently, there are increasing efforts to develop appropriate management strategies. Species-level indicators and assessments are hampered in the deep sea by the high proportion of unknown species routinely encountered. If environmental management is to keep pace with exploitation, alternative approaches including higher taxon surrogacy (taxonomic sufficiency) must be considered. Here we compare genus-and species-level studies of the diversity and ecology of deep-sea macrobenthos on the West Shetland Slope (NE Atlantic). This is an environmentally complex region that encompasses a biogeographic transition from temperate North Atlantic to Arctic conditions, and so may be particularly challenging for any general relationship between species-and genus-level analyses. We ask two questions: (i) does genus diversity reflect species diversity and (ii) does genus-level ecology reflect species-level ecology? We conclude that among the West Shetland Slope macrobenthos: (i) genus-level alpha- and beta-diversity measures are highly correlated with and good predictors of their species-level equivalents and (ii) that their ecology is very well described by genus-level data. We further note that, given the complexity of the West Shetland Slope environment, it may be reasonable to expect these conclusions to hold in other deep-sea environments.

AB  - This paper summarises the implementation of an industrial pilot plant with a malaxer machine designed and developed using a system that allows the control and the monitoring of malaxing parameters (CMPS). To study the reliability of the pilot plant, different malaxation conditions were tested in an industrial environment: the free acidity, common quality indicators of olive oil (e.g., peroxide value, total phenols), volatile compounds and sensory evaluation of the olive oil extracted were investigated. The results were correlated with the detected oxygen concentration during the malaxation process. The pilot plant proved to be a highly robust device capable of performing fast in-line measurements of oxygen concentration, controlling in real-time the oxygenation of the olive paste, and allowing the identification of a correlation between the oxygen concentration and the olive oil quality. The experimental tests also demonstrated that a controlled oxygen supply promotes the production of volatile compounds responsible for a balanced oil, avoiding the excessive oxidation of the oil. This work is aimed at contributing to the development of monitoring and controlling systems for olive oil extraction equipment, and providing design parameters to define a new malaxer machine model.

AB  - This article aims to shed light on the meaning of complexity for risk assessment of sociotechnical systems. The point of departure is that complexity is related to uncertainty as an indication of confidence in risk assessment. Complexity science points to limitations in risk analysis that owe to a mismatch between the nature of sociotechnical systems and how we approach them in search of prediction and control. Complexity complements uncertainty in three ways: as a source of uncertainty, as an additional type of uncertainty concerning deviations from what is designed, planned or assumed, and as an overall indication of limitations in the analysis with respect to potential for surprise. A new framework is suggested to clarify and make the concept of practical value to risk assessment. The framework consists of a definition, a conceptual map, an ontological and epistemological position, and a set of indicators. Complexity is explained in the conjunction of an analyst, a system, and a chosen model and is conditioned on the state of knowledge and the assessment context. It is epistemic in the sense that it resides in the analyst's understanding of the system and not in the system as such. A challenging implication is that complexity is relative in many respects, but this also provides opportunities for approaching it in risk assessment. The indicators can help to acknowledge, reduce, and describe complexity in pre-assessment, risk analysis, and risk evaluation.

AB  - The representation of pollen and spores in the fossil record of late Quaternary sedimentary sequences depends on several factors, including the production and dispersion of pollen grains. Thus, the analysis of modern pollen rain contributes to the understanding of these factors and to the knowledge of how vegetation is represented in the fossil pollen spectra. Modern pollen rain from eight vegetation types along an altitudinal gradient from 2300 +/- 4329 masl in the basin of Mexico are analyzed by using different statistical methods. Pollen spectra from high elevation plant communities > 380 ($) over bar0 masl were divided from low altitudes by applying cluster analysis. Based on pollen composition, this study uses DCA to distribute the plant communities in an altitudinal gradient, and probability density functions (PDF) are used to describe the distribution of pollen along the altitudinal gradient. Pollen taxa with low percentages characterize the low altitude sites, with PDFs similar to the parental taxa. Pinus, Poaceae and Asteraceae show wide altitudinal ranges and their PDFs reflect a pattern comparable to the parental taxa, while Quercus, Alnus, Salvia and Salix with narrow altitudinal ranges have PDFs that indicate pollen transport to higher altitude sites. The presence of Mimosa, which present a well defined PDF, can be used as an indicator of paleoenvironmental conditions in the fossil pollen sequences in the basin of Mexico.

AB  - Land use is a key driver of global environmental change. Unless major shifts in consumptive behaviours occur, land-based production will have to increase drastically to meet future demands for food and other commodities. One approach to better understand the drivers and impacts of agricultural intensification is the identification of global, archetypical patterns of land systems. Current approaches focus on broad-scale representations of dominant land cover with limited consideration of land-use intensity. In this study, we derived a new global representation of land systems based on more than 30 high-resolution datasets on land-use intensity, environmental conditions and socioeconomic indicators. Using a self-organizing map algorithm, we identified and mapped twelve archetypes of land systems for the year 2005. Our analysis reveals similarities in land systems across the globe but the diverse pattern at sub-national scales implies that there are no 'one-size-fits-all' solutions to sustainable land management. Our results help to identify generic patterns of land pressures and environmental threats and provide means to target regionalized strategies to cope with the challenges of global change. Mapping global archetypes of land systems represents a first step towards better understanding the global patterns of human-environment interactions and the environmental and social outcomes of land system dynamics.

AB  - The growth and quality of tobacco are associated with ecological conditions, such as soil, climate or weather, and geographical attributes. Tobacco, especially flue-cured tobacco, is an important cash crop and widely cultivated in southwestern China. However, knowledge about critical ecological indicators affecting quality of flue-cured tobacco is limited in this region. In the current study, two well-known clustering algorithms, i.e., k-means and classification and regression trees (CART), were applied to investigate the critical ecological indicators controlling quality of flue-cured tobacco. On the basis of six quality indices and Davis-Bouldin index, a total of 142 flue-cured tobacco leaf samples were classified into three groups with low, medium, and high quality using k-means algorithm. The results obtained by CART model showed that geographical attributes (altitude, latitude, and longitude) and weather indicators had high effects on the quality of fluecured tobacco followed by soil properties and varieties. Flue-cured tobacco plants with high quality preferred to be grown in areas with low values of altitude, rainfall and relative humidity, high values of latitude, longitude, sunshine hours, and temperature-related indices (mean, maximum and minimum temperatures and their difference), and low concentrations of soil nutrients in this study area. Nevertheless, further study should be conducted to understand the interaction among the ecological variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Rb/Sr ratio of lake sediments has been demonstrated to be a potential indicator of chemical weathering by increasing work. However, Rb and Sr in lake sediments are derived from both chemical weathering and physical erosion. Rb and Sr of different forms in lake sediments may record different environmental processes and information. In this study, the variation patterns of Rb and Sr of different forms in sediments of Daihai Lake were investigated. The results show that Rb and Sr of different forms display noticeably different variation patterns due to their different sources and associated environmental processes. Using the Rb/Sr ratios of bulk lake sediments to reflect chemical weathering is not accurate. The non-residual Sr of the sediments without detrital carbonates, representing the Sr leached from the catchment, can be used as an index of chemical weathering because the weathering of Sr minerals is very sensitive to climate change, and the non-residual Sr content of the sediment is determined more by Sr2+ influx than by the physicochemical conditions of lake water. The correspondence between the non-residual Sr and TIC/TOC in Daihai Lake also indicates that the non-residual Sr of the sediments is a good indicator of chemical weathering in the catchment.

AB  - Microbiological contamination from runoff is a human health concern in urbanized coastal environments, but the contamination sources are often unknown. This study quantified fecal indicator bacteria and compared the distributions of human-specific genetic markers and bacterial community composition during dry and wet weather in urban creeks draining two neighboring watersheds in Santa Barbara, CA. In a prior study conducted during exclusively dry weather, the creeks were contaminated with human waste as indicated by elevated numbers of the human-specific Bacteroidales marker HF183 (Sercu et al. in Environ Sci Technol 43:293-298, 2009). During the storm, fecal indicator bacterial numbers and loads increased orders of magnitude above dry weather conditions. Moreover, bacterial community composition drastically changed during rainfall and differed from dry weather flow by (1) increased bacterial diversity, (2) reduced spatial heterogeneity within and between watersheds, and (3) clone library sequences more related to terrestrial than freshwater taxa. Finally, the spatial patterns of human-associated genetic markers (HF183 and Methanobrevibacter smithii nifH gene) changed during wet weather, and the contribution of surface soils to M. smithii nifH gene detection was suspected. The increased fecal indicator bacteria numbers during wet weather were likely associated with terrestrial sources, instead of human waste sources that dominated during dry weather flow.

AB  - A study was conducted to ascertain the influence of a thermal discharge on the health and parasites of a coastal cold-water flatfish, the winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus), a species sensitive to environmental change. Flounder were sampled in spring 1998 and 1999 beneath the plume and at reference sites north and south up to I km from the discharge. Species diversity and estimates of abundance of macroscopic algae, invertebrates, and fish were also recorded. After capture by scuba divers, a comparison of condition factor, organ indices, blood values, histology, and parasites was made between groups of fish from the discharge and reference sites. Diversity and abundance of algae, invertebrates, and fish were considerably greater beneath the plume than at the reference sites. The thermal water had no apparent effect on flounder taken beneath the plume, but it affected both its ecto- and endoparasites. Prevalence and mean abundance of Cryptocotyle lingua metacercariae were significantly greater, whereas Trichodina jadranica and Gyrodactylus pleuronecti were less on the gills of fish sampled beneath the plume than at the reference sites. Four endoparasites, i.e., Ceratomyxa drepanopsettae, Steringophorus furciger, Macvicarius soleae, and Lecithaster gibbosus were significantly more abundant in the reference samples. These results suggest that environmental change affected transmission of the parasites of winter flounder exposed to the thermal effluent.

AB  - Determining the depth to which continental lithosphere can be subducted into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries is of importance for understanding the long-term growth of supercontinents as well as the dynamic processes that shape such margins. Recent discoveries of coesite and diamond in regional ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks has demonstrated that continental material can be subducted to depths of at least 120 km (ref. 1), and subduction to depths of 150-300 km has been inferred from garnet peridotites in orogenic UHP belts based on several indirect observations(2-5). But continental subduction to such depths is difficult to trace directly in natural UHP metamorphic crustal rocks by conventional mineralogical and petrological methods because of extensive late-stage recrystallization and the lack of a suitable pressure indicator. It has been predicted from experimental work, however, that solid-state dissolution of pyroxene should occur in garnet at depths greater than 150 km (refs 6-8). Here we report the observation of high concentrations of clinopyroxene, rutile and apatite exsolutions in garnet within eclogites from Yangkou in the Sulu UHP metamorphic belt, China. We interpret these data as resulting from the high-pressure formation of pyroxene solid solutions in subducted continental material. Appropriate conditions for the Na2O concentrations and octahedral silicon observed in these samples are met at depths greater than 200 km.

KW  - ACCUMULATION
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential toxic element, which is highly accumulated by tobacco leaves and is transferred to tobacco smoke thus contributing substantially to the permitted level of Cd intake by humans. Therefore, measures to reduce Cd accumulation by tobacco are of significant importance. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of soil liming on Cd uptake by tobacco plants in high Cd exposure. A pot experiment was conducted with Nicotiana tabacuw L. Samsun 53 on an acid Typic Haploxeralf amended with refuse sugarbeet lime to obtain a pH range from 5.3 to 7.0 and contaminated with 20 mg kg(-1) Cd applied as CdCl2. Tobacco was grown in pots for three months under natural conditions, harvested in four cuts and Cd uptake by leaves was estimated. In soil samples selected, pH, Cd extracted by DTPA method, and Cd fractions such as exchangeable, organically bound, carbonate and residual were determined. The results showed that Cd uptake influenced negatively tobacco yield. Soil liming decreased Cd uptake by tobacco plants. The DTPA method was not a good indicator for Cd availability in tobacco. A very strong relationship was recorded between exchangeable Cd and total Cd uptake showing that this Cd fraction is available to tobacco plants. Soil pH was correlated strongly in a negative way with this Cd fraction suggesting that this soil factor is very important in controlling Cd accumulation by tobacco.

LA  - English
CP  - 15th International Symposium on Chlorinated Dioxins, PCB and Related Compounds
AB  - PCBs were widely used in the 1970s in Finland. PCB usage was regulated the following decade and is presently strongly restricted. The reduction of PCB loading is generally observed as decreasing concentrations in environmental indicator species. The decreasing trend is seen clearly in the 25-year-long monitoring of northern pike in large lakes. The level of PCBs was approximately 5 to 15 mu g g(-1) (lipid weight) in the early 1970s, while present concentrations generally range from 0.5 to 3 mu g g(-1)(l.w.). In recent years, increasing concern about the pollution of Arctic areas by airborne contaminants has led to an expansion of monitoring of persistent contaminants in northern areas. Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus, L.) has been used as a circumpolar indicator species in the fresh water of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme. The level of PCBs in char was determined in two small subarctic lakes in northern Finland and were 0.1 and 0.5 mu g g(-1)(l.w.). There are several possible reasons for the variation between lakes: population density; growth conditions; nutrient level, and catching time. The PCB congener pattern is very similar in the fish samples of all large lakes and one small subarctic lake in spite of wide geographical coverage. The dominant congeners in these samples are IUPAC nos., 153, 138, 180, 118, 101. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Four groups of persons growing up in a nonstandard psyche-social environment during their childhood are followed up in a long term study. These children lived in children's homes, in the individual foster-parent care, in SOS children villages, the fourth group was formed by children born after the demonstrable unwanted pregnancy. The fifth group is the control group to the ''unwanted'' children. This group represents the approximate social norm for contemporary times.
   The study consists of three parts. This first part is concerning the group of 56 children growing up in children's homes since the early childhood till the completing the compulsory education, who have already reached the middle adult age now.
   The findings support the conception of the relation between the deprivational situation of the child and the later development of his/her personality. The followed up group deviates in the unfavourable direction in the common indicators of social integration and social successfulness. However, the outstanding differentiation of the influence of living conditions during the childhood according to the gender of persons followed up was found.
   Even the ability of social communication with the neighbourhood appears as a differentiating factor. The acceptance or refusing of taking part in the research of this type becomes in a certain way one of the tests of social competence of persons followed up.

AB  - The effect of processing procedures and overall environmental and hygienic conditions on the microbiological quality and safety of chicken carcasses was studied in a modem processing plant on two separate days. The level of microorganisms on chicken carcasses was assessed by a neck-skin ''maceration'' method. Carcasses were heavily contaminated by different types of organisms, including indicator organisms (total aerobics, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms and Escherichia coli) and pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter and Staphylococcus aureus). Microbial levels varied during processing, but the highest levels were detected after scalding and defeathering. Microbial levels did not change during vent opening or evisceration.
   Spray washing after evisceration did not reduce levels of bacteria. No substantial change occurred in bacteria levels during air-chilling, packaging and cold-storage; however, the finished product was heavily contaminated. In the freshly processed carcasses, mean counts (log colony forming units [CFU]/g neck-skin) of aerobic bacteria Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, E. coli, Campylobacter and S. aureus were 6.6, 4.5, 4.1, 3.6, 5.2 and 2.7 on the first sampling day, and 6.5, 4.6, 4.9, 3.6, 4.7 and 4.1 on the second day. Salmonella was present in all birds examined, including those coming directly from the farm. Major serotypes detected on dressed carcasses were Salmonella ohio, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella krefeld.

AB  - The vegetation in permanently marked plots was monitored by means of point surveys for canopy spread cover over a six-year period. This period spanned the drought of the early 1980s and the wetter phase of the late 1980s. In some respects the observed changes in the abundance of the different plant species conformed to the successional model which forms the basis of veld condition assessment in the Karoo. Annual grasses, as well as the creeping grass Tragus koelerioides, spread rapidly during the first two wet seasons after the end of the drought. They later declined in abundance, presumably as a result of competition with taller, tufted perennial grasses, which showed a slower but more sustained increase in abundance. However, the nature of the rainfall-induced changes differed between the two main plant communities in the study area: the Themeda triandra - Cymbopogon plurinodis community on stony areas and the Cynodon incompletus - Pentzia species community which occurred on less stony areas. Themeda triandra and Cymbopogon plurinodis never became abundant in the latter community, despite the improved rainfall and despite five years of protection against large herbivores in fenced exclosures. The two communities thus retained their distinctness throughout the observation period. The results are examined in relation to published hypotheses of the effect of winter and summer rain on the cover of grass and dwarf shrubs.

AB  - Protecting the environment requires ensuring such conditions that organisms living in it did not suffer permanent damage to their structures and life functions. This also applies to algae living in the aquatic environment. Some species of water flora especially quickly react to negative stimuli arriving from the environment. Their reactions to experienced stress may be a subtle criterion for assessing the condition of aquatic environment. To this kind of plants belong Chara, which are bioindicators of water quality. Their response to applied environmental stimuli is rapid changes of the electrical parameters of the cell membrane. Our research shows that there is also a change in the intensity of ultraweak luminescence (UWL) generated by these plants. UWL is a phenomenon that continuously accompanies processes occurring in living cells and its intensity is less than the threshold sensitivity of the human eye. The method of measurement of this little known way of Chara's response to environmental stimuli has the advantage that it is completely non-invasive for the test material. Non-invasiveness is due to the fact that the radiation emitted from the samples is measured outside the cell membrane separating the living matter from the surrounding environment.
   In our study, after exposure to a selected stimulus, three types of responses of plant cells were observed: 1) - after a temporary increase of UWL, there is a return to the level of light corresponding to undisturbed homeostasis (e.g. when ascorbic acid is added to the environment); 2) - after a temporary increase in the UWL, the emission of photons slightly falls and stabilizes at a new higher level of illumination (when the stress stimulus is e.g. lead acetate, the emission intensity is 2.2 times larger than in the beginning); 3) - after a sudden and significant increase of UWL, the high emission level is maintained for many hours (e.g. after adding sucrose follows a 20-fold increase of UWL).
   UWL curves obtained in our experiments correlate with the changes of entropy corresponding to the disturbance of homeostasis in individual cases, depending on the applied stimulus. Respectively: for 1) - an increase of entropy is temporary and is followed by a return to values before the application of the stimulus, 2) - a lasting change occurs, which consists in an increase of entropy to a new fixed level, 3) - change in entropy is so large that its value exceeds the so-called point of no return, which means that the disorder of homeostasis leads to cell death.
   The application of luminescence imaging technique Single Photon Counting Imaging (SPCI) to the test cells have revealed that the emission of photons from different parts of the plant has a different intensity. When the plant suffered mechanical damage by cutting pseudoleaves, the emission from the damaged sites increased dramatically. This observation allows the damage to be located. Thanks to SPCI technique, it is also possible to track over time any repair processes.
   The clear differentiation of UWL kinetics leads to the conclusion that monitoring its intensity can be a good research tool in environmental protection. It makes it possible to determine whether chemicals found in the aquatic environment are harmful to a given species of plants. It can be also assessed whether the degree of the harm threatens the entire population with extinction. Thus, the presented method can be used as an ecotoxicity test.

AB  - High Andean ponds and reservoirs are among the least-studied environments. We evaluated the composition of littoral macrobenthos and how it is affected by the physicochemical conditions of the water in El Pane reservoir (Peru), located at 4,550 m.a.s.l. Samples were taken between November 2017 and October 2018 from three zones in the reservoir: low (downstream), middle and high (upstream); two of these zones with fish farms (low and middle) and one zone without fish farms (high). The following physicochemical parameters of the water were measured: dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and temperature. The macrobenthic community was analysed through diversity indices such as Shannon-Wiener (H'), Simpson's dominance index (D), Pielou's evenness (J'), true diversity (D-1), and richness (S). The influence of the physicochemical variables on the macrobenthos was estimated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Dissolved oxygen was found to have lower values (<0.5 mg/l) than specified in the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS). Macroinvertebrate richness for the whole reservoir was 17 families, and the family with highest relative abundance was Chironomidae (42.24% in the low zone, 51% in the middle zone and 40.43% in the high zone). The indices showed greater species richness in the high zone, where there are no fish farms. Dissolved oxygen and conductivity were the main factors determining macrobenthos distribution and composition.

AB  - The economic value of bioethylene produced from bioethanol dehydration is remarkable due to its extensive usage in the petrochemical industry. Bioethylene is produced through several routes, such as steam cracking of hydrocarbons from fossil fuel and dehydration of bioethanol, which can be produced through fermentation processes using renewable substrates such as glucose and starch. The rise in oil prices, environmental issues due to toxic emissions caused by the combustion of fossil fuel and depletion of fossil fuel resources have led a demand for an alternative pathway to produce green ethylene. One of the abundant alternative renewable sources for bioethanol production is biomass. Bioethanol produced from biomass is alleged to be a competitive alternative to bioethylene production as it is environmentally friendly and economical. In recent years, many studies have investigated catalysts and new reaction engineering pathways to enhance the bioethylene yield and to lower reaction temperature to drive the technology toward economic feasibility and practicality. This paper critically reviews bioethylene production from bioethanol in the presence of different catalysts, reaction conditions and reactor technologies to achieve a higher yield and selectivity of ethylene. Techno-economic and environmental assessments are performed to further development and commercialization. Finally, key issues and perspectives that require utmost attention to facilitate global penetration of technology are highlighted.

AB  - Drought severity and its associated impacts remain persistent in the water-stressed regions of the world including the Sahel of Africa. Across the Sahel, there exist limited ground stations monitoring weather observations. This limitation has created an uphill task in trying to understand the role of climate in drought conditions across the entire Sahel of Africa; hence, the use of Earth observation satellite data for environmental events monitoring such as droughts. To determine the drought status of the Nigerian Sahel in a cost-efficient way, this study used Earth observation (EO) data (MODIS) and CORDEX precipitation flux. For accurate outcomes, the proposed algorithm by Kogan was explored in the study using R programming, which offers some appropriate characteristics for filtering cloud and other disturbances. The processing yields reliable drought indicators over the Sahel for various aggregate years and state zones. Drought severity index evaluated for the distinct Sahel region of Nigeria reflects how severe to extreme droughts characterised the period of 2001 to 2019 during late dry seasons, while the region observed mild droughts, such as years 2001 and 2003-2018 where the region observed no to moderate drought events during the wet seasons. As established in this study, the Sahel experiences severe droughts with a significantly higher water deficiency than elsewhere, especially during the late dry seasons.

AB  - In the present day, Internet technology and social media totally dominate as a means of communication. The media and social interaction have a two-sided nature, as the important role is not only those of the media messages to the users, but of the users to the media, too. This article aims to present the dominant importance of digital media, digital literacy transformation into a precondition for social inclusion, and an indicator of professional competence and social skills. Digital citizenship is a term that reflects the level of training and competencies, with a view to active participation in social, professional, and civic life. The article is based on two methods: Focus groups that were conducted in late 2019, which includes: Students, young mothers, pensioners, and unemployed. The second method used is the documents analysis-publications, materials, and quantitative results of research on social reactions to digital media as a source of information in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The combination of materials and data that have been analyzed are related to the period of the lockdown between March 2020 and December 2020. In the time of global social crises and confrontations, digital media literacy has turned out to be of critical importance for the normal course of social events and their interpretations. In this regard, digital citizenship contributes to social understanding and control, as well as the individual practices in the global pandemic trajectory.

AB  - Deep energy retrofit across the European building stock would require decades during which boundary conditions will change. This study identifies a range of retrofit pathways, using a dynamic stock model, a bottom-up energy model and an optimization model for different climate scenarios. We consider 1.1 million different retrofit options in the Swiss residential building stock for different economic/environmental objectives until 2060. Despite the replacement of old by new buildings, energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the reference scenario without deep energy retrofitting are likely to decrease by only about 25%, while accounting for investments of 2-3 billion CHF/a. Partial energy retrofitting or an investment-minimized pathway are neither cost-effective nor sufficient to get close to the net zero targets. In contrast, the highest GHG-saving pathway leads to very high emission reduction of 90%, but requires investment cost of 9 billion CHF/a, which leads to specific cost of 180 CHF/t CO(2)eq. The cost-optimal pathway shows moderate trade-offs for investment cost and could reach GHG savings of 77% with specific cost of 140 CHF/t CO(2)eq. Hence, early and deep energy retrofit is cost-effective and allows deep GHG emission reductions by making full use of the synergies between GHG and cost savings.

AB  - Biomonitoring is an essential tool for assessing ecological conditions and informing management strategies. The application of DNA metabarcoding and high throughput sequencing has improved data quantity and resolution for biomonitoring of taxa such as macroinvertebrates, yet, there remains the need to optimise these methods for other taxonomic groups. Diatoms have a longstanding history in freshwater biomonitoring as bioindicators of water quality status. However, multi-substrate periphyton collection, a common diatom sampling practice, is time-consuming and thus costly in terms of labour. This study examined whether the benthic kick-net technique used for macroinvertebrate biomonitoring could be applied to bulk-sample diatoms for metabarcoding. To test this approach, we collected samples using both conventional multi-substrate microhabitat periphyton collections and bulk-tissue kick-net methodologies in parallel from replicated sites with different habitat status (good/fair). We found there was no significant difference in community assemblages between conventional periphyton collection and kick-net methodologies or site status, but there was significant difference between diatom communities depending on site (P = 0.042). These results show the diatom taxonomic coverage achieved through DNA metabarcoding of kick-net is suitable for ecological biomonitoring applications. The shift to a more robust sampling approach and capturing diatoms as well as macroinvertebrates in a single sampling event has the potential to significantly improve efficiency of biomonitoring programmes that currently only use the kick-net technique to sample macroinvertebrates.

AB  - In the last decade, awareness and use of the concept of 4R Nutrient Stewardship (4RNS) has increased dramatically among practitioners and researchers focused on nutrient management. The term "4R" refers to use of the right source, right rate, right time, and right place in nutrient management. These four factors have been recognized as the major pillars of nutrient best management practices for at least 30 yr. However, the framework of 4RNS (which embeds the 4Rs in a cropping system and landscape that supports the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability) is a recent development. The global framework evolved through multiple versions over the last decade in a multi-sector collaborative effort to create a science-based concept to guide all involved in nutrient management practice, research, and communication. However, evidence-based 4RNS largely remains under development as measured datasets supporting simultaneous effects of sets of practices on performance indicators of sustainability are in short supply. Indicators include categories such as farmland productivity, soil health, nutrient use efficiency, water quality, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, food and nutrition security, biodiversity, and economic value. Such collaborative, multidisciplinary research is underway and is intended to foster continued evolution of our understanding of what is "right" for specific sets of conditions. Progress has occurred in recognition of the shared goals of public and private sectors and the value of true collaboration in advancing science-based nutrient stewardship.

AB  - Drought has a significant impact on agricultural, ecological, and socioeconomic spheres. Although many drought indices have been proposed until now, the detection of droughts at regional scales still needs to be further studied. The Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) that represents vegetation growing condition, the Standardized Water Index (SWI) that represents canopy water content, and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) that quantifies anomalies in the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration were calculated based on the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A new remote sensing-based Vegetation Drought Monitor Synthesized Index (VDSI) was proposed by integrating the SVI, SWI, and ESI in the northeast China. When tested against the in situ Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), VDSI with proper weights of three variables outperformed individual remote sensing drought indices. The county-level yields of the main crops in the study area from 2001 to 2010 were also used to validate the VDSI. The correlation analysis between the yield data and the VDSI data during the crop growing season was performed, and its results showed that VDSI during the crop reproductive growth period was strongly correlated with the variation of crop yield. It was proved that this index is a potential indicator for assessment of the spatial pattern of drought severity in northeast China.

AB  - The littoral zones of many Central European lakes are severely altered by lake-side retaining walls. These are suspected to impair littoral biota due to the reflection of incoming wave energy. We conducted a comparative study (armoured shore with a retaining wall and a restored shore with a wedge-shaped cobble embankment vs. a pristine shore) at a wind-exposed shore section of Lake Constance. The retaining wall had a number of significant remote effects on the littoral zone, i.e. increased near-bottom current velocities, higher bed-load transport rates, coarsening of surface sediments, reduction in phytomass density, reduction in total densities and number of taxa of macroinvertebrates as well as a significant decline in the percentages of Limnomysis benedeni Czerniavsky, 1882, Ostracoda, Corbicula fluminea O.F. Muller, 1774, Dreissenapolymorpha (Pallas, 1771) and other Bivalvia. However, the significantly affected zone had a rather narrow width of similar to 3 m. Shore restoration measures are needed to remediate negative effects of retaining walls and re-establish ecological conditions that are comparable to those of pristine shores. We recommend a more site sensitive sampling strategy, e.g. for macroinvertebrates in context with the ecological quality assessment under the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Mosses dominate the understory of black spruce forest, and changes in moss community composition and functional traits may influence many important ecosystem processes, particularly paludification due to accumulation of peat (mainly Sphagnum). To understand performance and fitness of ground-cover mosses in early forest succession following clearcutting, we investigated photosynthetic traits in Sphagnum and three feathermoss species (i.e., Hylocomium, Ptilium, and Pleurozium) coexisting in mature stands and decade-old black spruce harvest blocks. The results showed that all of these mosses have a significantly higher light saturation point at the harvested plots than the forested plots. Feathermosses at the harvested plots all underwent a reduction in quantum efficiency, chlorophyll b content, and chlorophylls:carotenoids ratio related to photoinhibition, particularly Pleurozium, which experienced a significant decrease in maximum net photosynthesis. In contrast, Sphagnum showed a significant increase in maximum gross photosynthesis, dark respiration, and the ratio of chlorophyll a:b at the harvested plots compared with the forested plots. The distinctive responses of moss photosynthetic traits indicate the potential proliferation of Sphagnum and decrease of feathermosses, and thus consequent peat accumulation. Our results emphasize the importance of the photosynthetic traits of moss as indicators of postharvest conditions for enhancing understory vegetation management to maintain and improve productivity of black spruce.

AB  - Advances in the field of redox biology have contributed to the understanding of the complexity of the thiol-based system in mediating signal transduction. The redox environment is the overall spatiotemporal balance of oxidation-reduction systems within the integrated compartments of the cell, tissues and whole organisms. The ratio of the reduced to disulfide glutathione redox couple (GSH:GSSG) is a key indicator of the redox environment and its associated cellular health. The reaction mechanisms of glutathione-dependent and related thiol-based enzymes play a fundamental role in the function of GSH as a redox regulator. Glutathione homeostasis is maintained by the balance of GSH synthesis (de novo and salvage pathways) and its utilization through its detoxification, thiol signalling, and antioxidant defence functions via GSH-dependent enzymes and free radical scavenging. As such, GSH acts in concert with the entire redox network to maintain reducing conditions in the cell. Caenorhabditis elegans offers a simple model to facilitate further understanding at the multicellular level of the physiological functions of GSH and the GSH-dependent redox network. This review discusses the C. elegans studies that have investigated glutathione and related systems of the redox network including; orthologs to the protein-encoding genes of GSH synthesis; glutathione peroxidases; glutathione-S-transferases; and the glutaredoxin, thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin systems.

AB  - This paper presents a 600-year well-dated, high-resolution Central Balkan paleo-record including the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450-1850 CE). Utilizing pollen-based REVEALS modeling estimates, geochemical indicators, rarefaction analyses and the AMS C-14-based Bacon age model, this first-hand record from the Sava Basin reveals the transformation of the Central Balkan landscape involving linkages between changing climatic and socio-political regimes. The pre-LIA interval (1370-1418 CE) in the Sava Region reveals a wooded steppe and increased cultivation under warmer/stable climatic and socio-political conditions. In contrast, the LIA interval in the region is expressed through continuous transitions between forest and grassland, extensive land erosion and stressed agriculture, potentially as a collective artifact of the climatic variability and human impact associated with socio-political stressors of the time. The post-LIA/Industrial Era interval (1850-2012 CE) in the Sava Region shows an overall increase in woodland as well as agriculture following the exit of the Ottomans. However, increased population pressures and the subsequent onset of the Industrial Revolution as well as increased trade led to intense deforestation throughout the 20th century, which continued during the Socialist period.

AB  - Climate change poses serious threats to agriculture. As a primary staple crop and major contributor to agriculturally derived greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, rice systems are of particular significance to building climate resilience. We report on a participatory assessment of climate resilience in organic and conventional rice systems located in four neighboring villages in Negros Occidental, Philippines. The Philippines is one of the foremost countries impacted by climate change, with an increasing incidence of climate-related disturbances and extensive coastlines, high population density and heavy dependence on agriculture. Using the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Self-evaluation and Holistic Assessment of climate Resilience of farmers and Pastoralists (SHARP) tool, we measured 13 agroecosystem indicators of climate resilience, and assessed the degree to which household, farm, and community mechanisms and outcomes impact adaptation capacity, mitigation potential and vulnerability. We used a participatory approach to situate these indicators in their socio-ecological context, and identify targeted interventions for enhancing climate resilience based on local farmer experiences and socio-ecological conditions. Comparison of climate resilience indicators across organic and conventional rice systems in this region indicated that organic rice systems are more climate resilient than their conventional counterparts. As such, increased policy support for the development of organic rice systems are critically important as an adaptive mechanism to augment food security, mitigate GHG emissions and improve climate resilience in the Philippines.

AB  - Biological oxygen demand (BOD) in mineral and organic horizons of soddy-podzolic soils in the forest-park belt of Moscow as an indicator of their microbial respiration and potential biodestruction function has been studied. The BOD of soil samples has been estimated with a portable electrochemical analyzer after incubation in closed flasks under optimum hydrothermal conditions. A universal gradation scale of this parameter from very low (< 2 g O-2/(m(3) h)) to extremely high (> 140 g O-2/(m(3) h)) has been proposed for mineral and organic horizons of soil. A physically substantiated model has been developed for the vertical distribution of BOD in the soil, which combines the diffusion transport of oxygen from the atmosphere and its biogenic uptake in the soil by the first-order reaction. An analytical solution of the model in the stationary state has been obtained; from it, the soil oxygen diffusivity and the kinetic constants of O-2 uptake have been estimated, and the profile-integrated total BOD value has been calculated (0.4-1.8 g O-2/(m(2) h)), which is theoretically identical to the potential oxygen flux from the soil surface due to soil respiration. All model parameters reflect the recreation load on the soil cover by the decrease in their values against the control.

AB  - A comprehensive study of the two sub-steps composite implicit time integration scheme for the structural dynamics is presented in this paper. A framework is proposed for the convergence accuracy analysis of the generalized composite scheme. The local truncation errors of the acceleration, velocity, and displacement are evaluated in a rigorous procedure. The presented and proved accuracy condition enables the displacement, velocity, and acceleration achieving second-order accuracy simultaneously, which avoids the drawback that the acceleration accuracy may not reach second order. The different influences of numerical frequencies and time step on the accuracy of displacement, velocity, and acceleration are clarified. The numerical dissipation and dispersion and the initial magnitude errors are investigated physically, which measure the errors from the algorithmic amplification matrix's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The load and physically undamped/damped cases are naturally accounted. An optimal algorithm-Bathe composite method ( Bathe and Baig, 2005; Bathe, 2007; Bathe and Noh, 2012) is revealed with unconditional stability, no overshooting in displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and excellent performance compared with many other algorithms. The proposed framework also can be used for accuracy analysis and design of other multi-sub-steps composite schemes and single-step methods under physical damping and/or loading.

AB  - The present study was conducted to preserve the microbial quality of chicken meat fillets during storage time by using sodium alginate active coating solutions incorporated with different natural antimicrobials including nisin, Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), and rosemary essential oils (EOs) which were added individually and in combination. The samples were stored in refrigeration condition for 15 days and were analyzed for total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae count, lactic acid bacteria count, Pseudomonas spp. count, psychrotrophic count, and yeast and mold count, as well as fate of inoculated Listeria monocytogenes at 3-day intervals. Results indicated that values of tested microbial indicators in all samples increased during storage. Antimicrobial agents, when used in combination, had stronger effect in preserving the microbial quality of chicken meat samples rather than their individual use and the strongest effect was observed in samples coated with alginate solution containing both cinnamon and rosemary EOs (CEO + REO). However, all treatments significantly inhibited microbial growth when compared to the control (P < 0.05). Therefore, based on the results of this study, application of alginate coating solutions containing nisin, cinnamon, and rosemary EOs as natural preservatives is recommended in meat products especially in chicken meats.

AB  - Two trials were conducted to study the effect of feeding barley silage on the behaviour and performance of beak-trimmed laying hens. In each trial, 20 hens and 2 roosters were housed in each of eight group-housed enriched cages, with four cages provided a laying hen diet and four cages additionally given free access to barley silage. Egg production and quality, and hen behaviour were assessed throughout the trials (Trial One 20-30 weeks; Trial Two 19-28 weeks). Data were analysed using Proc Mixed of SAS 9.4 and differences were significant when P <= 0.05. Silage-fed hens consumed 41 (13.9 g DM) and 50 (13.5 g DM) grams of silage per hen per day in Trials One and Two, respectively, while consuming less layer diet. Birds fed silage spent less time expressing aggressive and feather-pecking behaviours and in nest boxes, and more time feeding than control birds. Egg production, egg quality, and bird weight were not affected by treatment; yolk colour was darker for the silage treatment. Feathering quality was improved in silage-fed birds compared to control birds. It was concluded that providing hens with access to barley silage can improve welfare indicators without negatively affecting the egg production and egg quality.

AB  - In a field experiment based on a five-year crop rotation (pea, potato, barley undersown with red clover, red clover and winter wheat), several soil parameters, porosity, number and biomass of earthworms, total nitrogen, organic carbon, percentage of water stable aggregates and enzymatic activity, were studied during 2013 and 2014, the first and second year, respectively, since the first rotation concluded. This rotation was managed under three organic farming systems: Organic 0 (control), Organic I (with winter cover crops lately incorporated into the soil as green manure) and Organic II (with the same cover crops plus a yearly amendment of 40tha(-1) of cattle manure). Crop rotation had a yearly positive effect on the soil bulk density, and enhanced the percentage of air filled pores; nonetheless, despite the leguminous crops in the rotation, all the systems presented a yearly decrease in total nitrogen in 2014. Cover crops along with manure only had a significant effect on enzymatic activity; however no significant effect was found in soil organic carbon content, soil particle aggregability or number and biomass of earthworms. This was connected with the intensive tillage carried out in the systems, the weather conditions and the characteristics of the organic amendments. However according to other studies these results could be transient and further long-term investigations will be needed.

AB  - The different recharge sources and their mixing ratios were investigated in water samples from an urban aquifer. Two distinct zones from Barcelona city were compared: (1) Poble Sec and (2) Besos River Delta, which are located in a densely populated area with a strong industrial impact. In this study 106 water samples were collected from July 2007 to May 2010 for hydrochemical and isotopic characterisation. The application of environmental isotopes coupled with hydrochemistry provided the necessary information to isotopically quantify groundwater recharge sources and evaluate the occurrence of redox processes. In the Besos River Delta, a decrease in dissolved SO42- concentration and an increase in delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4) values were observed in groundwater samples, both indicating SO42- reduction. Moreover, other chemical indicators supported a reducing environment, such as low or null levels of dissolved O-2 and NO3-, the presence of NH4+ and an increase in dissolved Fe and As. The reducing conditions were probably induced by the organic C dissolved in water infiltrating from the River Besos. In Poble Sec, the relationship between delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4) showed a strong influence of sewage water infiltration into the aquifer.

AB  - Despite over 100 years of phytoplankton research in the Baltic Sea, little is known about how the species composition has changed during this period, characterised by severe anthropogenic eutrophication. We investigated the phytoplankton communities in the northern Baltic Sea using data from 1903 to 1911 and 1993 to 2005; to minimise effects of methodological differences we focused on occurrence frequencies. We found that the historical and modern communities differed regarding both species composition and the relative importance of taxonomical groups. The most obvious differences were the increase of dinoflagellates and decrease in the diatom to dinoflagellate ratio in all seasons. Contrary to the widely held view that cyanophytes have gained significance, our results indicate that in terms of occurrence the group has not increased in summer, and has lost ground in both spring and autumn. Several shifts in the occurrence frequency and seasonality of individual taxa transpired. Examining our results in relation to environmental conditions we found that some changes may be symptomatic of climate change related pressures. However, statistical analyses revealed that an undefined 'period effect' was the most important factor separating the historical and modern phytoplankton communities. We interpret this 'period effect' as evidence for the direct and/or indirect influence of eutrophication.

AB  - Over the past four decades, research has consistently documented negative correlations between the Crowne-Marlowe (CM) social desirability trait scale and numerous measures of sensitive behaviors, conditions, and opinions. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that persons with self-presentation concerns tend to under-report negative information. In contrast to this classic social desirability interpretation, a second perspective, labeled the true-behavior hypothesis, maintains that these correlations in fact reflect accurate reporting of both sets of variables, suggesting that the CM scale is not a sensitive indicator of the social desirability trait. We test these alternative interpretations by examining data from a community survey that collected both self-reports of cocaine use and the biological specimens necessary to validate the self-reports. In bivariate analyses, the CM scale was found to be associated with the concordance of cocaine use reporting and biological assays in a manner consistent with the classic social desirability hypothesis. The CM scale was not found to be associated with actual cocaine use, as measured by drug test assays, a finding inconsistent with the true-behavior hypothesis. After adjusting for other known correlates of substance use in logistic regression models, the CM scale was not associated with cocaine use under-reporting, nor with actual cocaine use behavior. Until further evidence is available, we conclude that the CM may be a questionable indicator of socially desirable reporting behavior in social surveys.

AB  - P>In this paper we propose a straightforward method to derive a non-inflationary rate of capacity utilization (NIRCU) based on micro data. We condition the current capacity utilization of firms on their current and planned price adjustments. The non-inflationary capacity utilization rate is then defined as the rate where a firm feels no price adjustment pressure. One of the main advantages is that this methodology uses structural aspects and does not make it necessary to operate with - often rather arbitrary - statistical filters. We show that our aggregate NIRCU performs remarkably well as an indicator of inflationary pressure in a Phillips curve estimation.Dans ce memoire, on propose une methode simple pour deriver le taux non-inflationniste d'utilisation de la capacite (NIRCU) a partir de micro-donnees. On etablit l'utilization de la capacite des firmes sur la base des ajustements (presents ou anticipes) de prix. Le taux non-inflationniste d'utilisation de la capacite est alors defini comme celui ou la firme ne ressent aucune pression pour ajuster ses prix. L'un des principaux avantages de cette approche est que cette methodologie utilise les aspects structurels et ne necessite pas qu'on utilise des filtres statistiques souvent arbitraires. On montre que le NIRCU agrege performe relativement bien en tant qu'indicateur de la pression inflationniste dans la calibration de la courbe de Phillips.

AB  - In this paper, new solutions to the problem of making measurements, of carbonation and chloride ingress, in particular, in concrete structures are considered. The approach has focused on the design, development, and use of fiber-optic sensors (FOSs), recognizing the need in that conventional devices are often either inaccurate, expensive, or unsuitable for encapsulation in the material. The sensors have been designed to monitor, in situ and non-destructively, relevant physical, and chemical changes in cementitious materials. Three different types of FOS were constructed, tested, and evaluated specifically for this application, these being a temperature sensor (based on the fluorescence decay) and pH and chloride sensors, based on sol-gel (solidified gel) technology with appropriate impregnated indicators. The sensors were all designed to be inserted into the structures and evaluated under the harshest conditions, i.e., being mounted when the mortar is poured and thus tested in situ, with the temperature and pH sensors successfully embedded in mortar. The outcomes of these tests have shown that both the temperature sensor and the pH sensor were able to function correctly for the duration of the work-for over 18 months after placement. The laboratory tests on the chloride sensor showed it was able to make measurements but was not reversible, limiting its potential utility for in situ environments. Research is ongoing to refine the sensor performance and extend the testing.

AB  - In this paper, a novel approach to energy and CO2 emission modelling of cogeneration systems coupled to electric heat pumps is presented. The specific objectives are to identify the relevant parameters and variables involved in the analysis of such composite systems, and to provide a synthetic and indicative assessment of the energy and environmental benefits potentially brought with respect to conventional energy systems. To this purpose, the concept of equivalent cogeneration plant is introduced, characterized by equivalent electrical and thermal efficiencies obtained by transforming the classical cogeneration efficiencies through the energy-shifting characteristics of the heat pump. The latter point is further highlighted by introducing equivalent cogeneration ratios and a thermal multiplication factor (TMF) indicator. This formulation allows investigation of the performance of the cogeneration-heat pump system by using the equivalent efficiencies as the input entries to equivalent energy saving and emission reduction indicators. The conditions at which energy and emission benefits occur, and their extent with respect to classical generation means, are illustrated through various numerical examples, highlighting the generality and effectiveness of the models introduced. In particular, equivalent cogeneration systems for small-scale distributed applications can exhibit energy saving and emission reduction of the order of up to 50% with respect to benchmark generation means within a typical Italian energy context.

AB  - Poor sanitation and insufficient disposal of sewage and faeces are primarily responsible for water associated health problems in developing countries. Domestic sewage and faeces are prevalently discharged into surface waters which are used by the inhabitants as a source for drinking water. This paper presents a decentralized anaerobic process technique for handling of such domestic organic waste. Such an efficient and compact system for treating faeces and food waste may be of great benefit for developing countries. Besides a stable biogas production for energy generation, the reduction of bacterial pathogens is of particular importance. In our research we investigated the removal capacity of the reactor concerning pathogens, which has been operated under thermophilic conditions. Faecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci have been detected as indicator organisms for bacterial pathogens. By the multiple regression analysis technique an empirical mathematical model has been developed. The model shows a high correlation between removal efficiency and both, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and temperature. By this model an optimized HRT for defined bacterial pathogens effluent standards can be easily calculated. Thus, hygiene potential can be evaluated along with economic aspects. In this paper not only results for describing the hygiene potential of a thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor are presented, but also an exemplary method to draw the right conclusions out of biological tests with the aid of mathematical tools.

AB  - In this article suicide is examined from a psychological and economical perspective. Contrasting with the relatively low rates of suicide in Latin America as compared to ex-URSS and other European countries, this phenomenon has experienced a progressive growth in Chile, especially among 15-34 years old population. The analysis of suicide rates in Chile for the 1981-2002 period shows an ascending and uneven curve, which is correlated with some economical indexes, such as GDP (r=0.87). A predictive model that relates GDP and suicide (error of 3.8%) is presented. Chilean global social market economy model has lead to economical growth but it has caused economic and health inequality, precarious labour conditions, and interpersonal distrust, which may explain the poor mental health indicators, as measure by growing suicide rates. In this analysis of suicide, several methodological difficulties were found. First, there is a lack of updated databases, which makes difficult the comparisons among Latin-American countries. Second, it is very difficult to get individual information for most cases of suicide, and, when it is available, the records are incomplete, lacking of epidemiologically relevant data, such a the educational level of the victim. It is concluded that an analysis of suicide in Latin-America should include both a psycho-social and an economical perspective. Researchers, officers and authorities are encouraged to update the databases in the countries of the region.

AB  - To better understand how photoperiod and body size interact to affect age at maturity, PIT-tagged 2-year-old Salvelinus alpinus (ca. 300 g, n = 330) were reared in fresh water from February 3 under four treatments, either 18-h light/6-h dark (LD18:6) for 42 days then LD8:16 (long-short); LD18:6 for 42 days then simulated natural (long-ambient); constant LD18:6 (constant-long); or simulated seasonal photoperiod cycle (control). Temperature was 10 degreesC. In November, the incidence of maturity in the long-short treatment was reduced to 44% among males and 20% among females, compared to 83% and 50% in the control (p < 0.05), increasing the proportion of high-value fish (> 1 kg and immature) by over four-fold. The long-ambient treatment also reduced maturation (p < 0.05), but to a lesser degree, 66% and 32% in the respective sexes. The constant-long treatment had no effect on males and increased maturation among females. The arrest of sexual maturation was associated with a marked alteration in seasonal pattern of growth suggesting it was due to a suppression of somatic growth. By contrast, initial body size and condition factor were poor indicators of incipient maturing fish. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The renal disposition characteristics of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and its derivatives, including macromolecular conjugates with polyethylene glycol and carboxymethyl-dextran, a cationized derivative, and glycosylated derivatives with galactose and mannose, were studied in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Renal disposition processes, such as glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and uptake from the capillary side, were quantitatively determined by single-pass indicator dilution experiments under filtering and nonfiltering kidney conditions. Native SOD had a high glomerular filtration rate (40% of that of inulin) and was effectively reabsorbed in the tubules, while no significant uptake was observed from capillary side. Macromolecular conjugates showed restricted glomerular filtration due to an increase in molecular size. Cationization of SOD greatly enhanced its association with the tissue, not only from the luminal side but also from the capillary side, based upon electrostatic interaction. Galactosylated and mannosylated SOD showed reduced tubular reabsorption and increased exposure of the luminal surface to the enzyme. In addition, a small but significant uptake of mannosylated SOD from the capillary side was observed. This uptake was dose-dependent and completely inhibited by mannan, suggesting that mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis existed in the capillary side of the kidney. Thus, we can manipulate the renal disposition profiles of son by changing its physicochemical or biological properties through chemical modification.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze time-lagged heat stress (HS) effects during late gestation on genetic co(variance) components in dairy cattle across generations for production, female fertility, and health traits. The data set for production and female fertility traits considered 162,492 Holstein Friesian cows from calving years 2003 to 2012, kept in medium-sized family farms. The health data set included 69,986 cows from calving years 2008 to 2016, kept in participating large-scale co-operator herds. Production traits were milk yield (MKG), fat percentage (fat%), and somatic cell score (SCS) from the first official test-day in first lactation. Female fertility traits were the nonreturn rate after 56 d (NRR56) in heifers and the interval from calving to first insemination (ICFI) in first-parity cows. Health traits included clinical mastitis (MAST), digital dermatitis (DD), and endometritis (FM) in the early lactation period in first-parity cows. Meteorological data included temperature and humidity from public weather stations in closest herd distance. The HS indicator was the temperature-humidity index (THI) during dams' late gestation, also defined as in utero HS. For the genetic analyses of production, female fertility, and health traits in the offspring generation, a sire-maternal grandsire random regression model with Legendre polynomials of order 3 for the production and of order 2 for the fertility and health traits on prenatal THI, was applied. All statistical models additionally considered a random maternal effect. THI from late gestation (i.e., prenatal climate conditions), influenced genetic parameter estimates in the offspring generation. For MKG, heritabilities and additive genetic variances decreased in a wave-like pattern with increasing THI. Especially for THI >58, the decrease was very obvious with a minimal heritability of 0.08. For fat% and SCS, heritabilities increased slightly subjected to prenatal HS conditions at THI >67. The ICFI heritabilities differed marginally across THI [heritability (h(2)) = 0.02 0.04]. For NRR56, MAST, and DD, curves for heritabilities and genetic variances were U-shaped, with largest estimates at the extreme ends of the THI scale. For EM, heritability increased from THI 25 (h(2)= 0.13) to THI 71 (h(2) = 0.39). The trait-specific alterations of genetic parameters along the THI gradient indicate pronounced genetic differentiation due to intrauterine HS for NRR56, MAST, DD, and EM, but decreasing genetic variation for MKG and ICFI. Genetic correlations smaller than 0.80 for NRR56, MAST, DD, and EM between THI 65 with corresponding traits at remaining THI indicated genotype by environment interactions. The lowest genetic correlations were identified when considering the most distant THI. For MKG, fat%, SCS, and ICFI, genetic correlations throughout were larger than 0.80, disproving concerns for any genotype by environment interactions. Variations in genetic (co) variance components across prenatal THI. may be due to epigenetic modifications in the offspring genome, triggered by in utero HS. Epigenetic modifications have a persistent effect on phenotypic responses, even for traits recorded late in life. However, it is imperative to infer the underlying epigenetic mechanisms in ongoing molecular experiments.

AB  - Ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest relict plants in the existing seed plants. It is a historical heritage and living fossil. It is a world natural heritage unimaginable by human beings and a milestone in revealing nature's mysteries. The primary study areas with G. biloba plants are located in North-East Ukraine (Sumy region). A comparative analysis of the condition of seedlings in 2018 and 2019 was conducted. The plants were examined for the following morphological parameters: plant height, annual growth size, shoot diameter at the base, and the number of leaves. In two variants, about 100 plants were examined. The vitality analysis of seedlings with the establishment of their quality index is carried out. Studies of G. biloba leaves' morphological parameters from artificial plantations in Ukraine (Sumy) and natural plantations of China from the province were also carried out. Zhejiang province covers an area of 105,500 square kilometers and is located on the southeast coast of China. 118 degrees 01'-123 degrees 10'E bounds Zhejiang Province, 27 degrees 02'-31 degrees 11' N, east of the East China Sea, north of Shanghai, which is China's largest city, and Qiantang River is the largest river in Zhejiang. Its climate is Subtropical monsoon. The average annual rainfall is 980-2 000 mm, the average annual sunshine is 1710-2100 hours, and the average annual temperature is 15-18 degrees C. We selected three G. biloba groups for investigation and data collection. These three places are located west of Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province, about 5 kilometers apart. The G. biloba tree group in Guanshan, Lingshanwu, and Wuxie Village Zhejiang Province, China, were measured in 2019. The age of the trees ranges from 20 years to 500 years. The height is generally more than 15 meters, and the breast diameter is more than 20 cm. In order to ensure the randomness of the data, we choose a tree every 50 meters. Studies have shown a statistically significant difference between leaves from China and Ukraine. Simultaneously, the leaf blade's size was more extensive in the leaves of G. biloba from artificial plantations in Ukraine. Morphometric analysis of G. biloba plantations (Ukraine) showed statistically significant differences between plant morphological parameters in 2018 compared to 2019, which indicates the intensity of growth and the positive trends in plants' vegetative growth mass. Plant height increased from 26.68 +/- 1.01 cm in 2018 to 40.07 +/- 1.72 cm in 2019, the annual increase, respectively, from 10.34 +/- 0.89 to 13.90 +/- 0.92. Such an indicator as the shoot diameter at the base has tripled (from 0.42 +/- 0.02 cm in 2018 to 1.41 +/- 0.02 cm in 2019). Differences between all morphological parameters have high statistical reliability (from 0.01 to 0.001). The differences were confirmed by the results of vitality analysis, which showed an increase in plant quality and their transition from equilibrium in 2018 (Q = 0.300) to prosperous in 2019 (Q = 0.465), which indicates optimal growth conditions and confirms the possibility of growing G. biloba plantation method for obtaining medicinal raw materials in North-East Ukraine.

AB  - Pigs are more adaptable to the conditions of large-scale production as they can resist to stress factors. Hence methods of determining individual constitutional characteristics of animals are searched for, the best of them could then be utilized in production process. In this paper we assess individual ethological characteristics of pigs which occur in experimental conditions of the closed environment. The results are analyzed in view of age differences. We believe that behavioral characteristics may be predicted at early age. This is very important for pig management on large-scale production farm as well as on small farms.
   Our investigation involved 138 pigs - 69 gilts, 69 barrows of the Landrace (n = 32), Hampshire (n = 15) and Duroc (n = 8) breeds and various hybrids. Thirty-minute habituation test was used in which different reactions of animals to the new environment of an experimental chamber (320 x 420 cm) were observed. Each animal was tested in a morning and afternoon test at the age of three (37 kg) and six (85 kg) months. The observed indicators of behavior were these: motor activity shown by crossing the grids depicted on the floor of the experimental chamber, and vocal (acoustic) manifestations recorded by means of press buttons on a recording apparatus - multiple sound track kymograph. The results were processed statistically by Spearman's rank-order correlation and log-log transformation.
   The data facilitate to characterize: 1) age differences in the level of excitability of particular animals and groups shown by the number of reactions per identical time interval, and 2) age differences in habituation process. The level of excitability was given by the frequencies of reactions of the indicator of grid-crossings and vocal manifestations. Motor activity of three-month piglets was always larger in the morning tests than in the six-month ones. Many of the differences am statistically creasing live weight. The activity drop was larger in the barrows. On the other hand, as for vocal manifestations the excitability was larger in the six-month animals than in the three-month ones. The increased frequency in the six-month animals at the end of the afternoon test, particularly in the sows, indicates sexual differences in the frequency of these indicators. There was not a marked difference in the rate of the habituation process of motor activity between the three-month and six-month animals with respect to age differences (Fig. 2). On the contrary, habituation of vocal manifestations was considerably faster in the three-month animals than in the six-month ones (P < 0.05). With regard to age differences, habituation of vocal manifestations did not show any differences. This is due to some individuals in which the frequency of vocal manifestations was increasing at six months of age. This process was explicit particularly in the gilts.
   The results indicate a possibility of determining individual excitation characteristics and choosing criteria for selection of animals with optimum behavioral characteristics for large-scale production as well as small types of pig farms in the early stage of ontogenetic development. The possibility of prediction of excitation characteristics of animals at adult age cannot be excluded. It is also important for practical application to observe relationships between the behavioral, excitation characteristics and carcass value of different constitutional types.

AB  - The economic challenges of microalgae biodiesel production, including the energy burden and water shortage, can be addressed simultaneously by using wastewater as a nitrogen source. However, as a major form of nitrogen, ammonium is toxic to most microalgae strains, which limits the use of ammonium-containing wastewater. High-ammonium-tolerant algal strains remain to be explored. In this study, a microalgal strain named HDMA-01, which was isolated from Lake Dongfeng in China, was selected using a high ammonium medium. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that HDMA-01 belongs to the genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales), and both 18S ribosomal DNA and ITS sequences of HDMA-01 appeared to be new molecular records of the Monoraphidium species. HDMA-01 can multiply vigorously using acetic acid and ammonium in TAP medium, reaching a density of 2 x10(7) mL(-1) within 7 days. HDMA-01 showed strong tolerance for ammonium. At a high ammonium concentration of 14 mM, HDMA-01 achieved maximum biomass and lipid productivity of 78.9 mg L-1 day(-1) and 13.8 mg L-1 day(-1), which is the highest among other Monoraphidium strains under similar cultivation conditions. Together with its ideal fatty acid profile, HDMA-01 has great potential for development as a promising strain used in biodiesel feedstock and high-ammonium tolerance biotechnology.

AB  - As sustainability, increasing of fuel and energy efficiency has become a greater concern in aircraft design and fleet operation for two decades. To meet this need, a new methodology is being developed here that proposes the use of optimization for indexing the sustainability throughout flight phases of the aircraft and its power system. In this study, off-design modeling of several exergetic parameters for the turbofan engine is conducted by using genetic algorithm at cruise phase. In this context, exergetic sustainability parameters such as exergy efficiency, wasted exergy ratio, exergy destruction factor, environmental effect factor and exergetic sustainability index are calculated for the aircraft engine. After this process, linear modeling of exergetic indexes, depending on Mach (0.7-0.9) and altitude (9-11 km) ranges is performed. The results highlight that the linear modeling of exergetic parameters with the genetic algorithm (GA) enhances accuracy of the model compared to the least square method (LSM). Modeling of exergy efficiency for the turbofan is achieved with R = 0.9974 by LSM whereas it is obtained with R = 0.9999 by GA at altitude of 11 km. Finally, modeling of exergetic metrics for turbofan engine by using parametric flight data could enable so as to determine optimum cruise flight conditions in terms of both engine performance and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the modalities of choice for immunotherapy. This class of products are known to exhibit considerable heterogeneity with respect to size, aggregation states, and charge. This makes it challenging for biopharmaceutical manufacturers, in particular biosimilar producers, to maintain consistency in product quality. In order to fingerprint these biotherapeutic products, multiple, high-resolution analytical tools are used to characterize the numerous critical quality attributes. Recently, there has been growing interest in enhancing adaptability of 1D and 2D NMR platforms for characterization of higher order structure with emphasis on 1D H-1, 2D H-1-N-15 and H-1-C-13 NMR experiments at natural abundance. In this communication, we report the applicability of 2D-DOSY NMR for quantification of colloidal diffusivities, namely diffusion coefficient (and associated hydrodynamic radius) for monomeric IgG1 mAb formulations at physiological conditions. Similarity assessment has been performed for trastuzumab originator (multiple batches) and marketed biosimilars to showcase the applicability of this approach. While dynamic light scattering measurements are known to be sensitive to presence of larger particles with a concentration dependence for estimation of colloidal diffusivities, size estimated by NMR experiments was found to be more in agreement with the computational hydrodynamic size estimations derived from the published crystal structures of intact mAb at formulation concentration.

AB  - Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by Ehrlichia canis is one of the leading tick-borne diseases of dogs, particularly in tropical countries. A highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method is essential for early detection to facilitate treatment. This study was conducted to develop E. canis loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, a highly sensitive yet simple molecular technique, targeting the citrate synthase (gltA) gene of E. canis. Canine blood samples were subjected to conventional PCR targeting E. canis gltA. After analysis of the sequences of PCR amplicons, LAMP primers were generated. The optimum temperature and time for the LAMP assay were determined using eight samples-after which, the effectiveness and reproducibility of LAMP were verified by testing 40 samples, which included PCR-positive and negative samples. The detection limit was also established. The optimal condition for the assay was 61 degrees C for 60 min. Compared to PCR, the LAMP assay had a relative sensitivity and specificity of 92.5 and 100%, respectively. Statistical analysis using McNemar's test showed that the E. canis LAMP assay has no significant difference with PCR. Therefore, the LAMP assay developed in this study may be used as an alternative to PCR in the detection of E. canis.

AB  - Dairy cattle production is distributed throughout the Brazilian regions. However, Brazilian producing regions are different in air temperature and humidity, diet, birth season, and other factors that may alter the reproductive performances of cows. The age of the cow at first calving (AFC) is a good indicator of sexual precocity since it shows the beginning of the female reproductive life and has a great influence on cow replacement costs. Researches on genotype-environment interaction (GEI) show the importance of using specific bulls for the different production systems in Brazil since most semen used in the country is imported. The objective of this work was to evaluate GEI for AFC in Holstein cows in Brazil, using reaction norms. The statistical models used were the standard animal model, which disregards the GEI, and hierarchical reaction norm models with homo-scedastic (HRNMHO) and heteroscedastic (HRNMHE) residual variance, and one (HRNMHOlS and HRNMHE1S) and two (HRNMHO2S and HRNMHE2S) steps. HRNMHOlS presented better fit to the data, with lower heritability for environments with lower AFC, and higher heritability for environments with higher AFC. The GEI found was complex, with a reclassification of bulls, denoting the importance of considering GEI for evaluation and selection of bulls for different production levels. The reduction of AFC is possible when using breeding bulls adapted to the tropical and subtropical conditions of Brazil.

Here we present the results of a study that examines the coastal morphodynamics of the Calypsostranda coastline in Svalbard (High Arctic) between 2007 to 2017 and compare these short-term changes to previous studies for the period 1936-2007. During the 2007-2017 study period, the study area lost ca. 10,710 m(2), at a mean Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) of -1.86 m and End Point Rate (EPR) -0.19 m/yr. Erosion also dominated between 1936-2007, -28,800 m(2), at a mean NSM of -4.99 m and EPR -0.07 m/yr. Using EPR and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) parameters, we divide the Calypsostranda coastline into eroding and aggrading zones. The overall pattern of coastline change during the two study periods is similar, but the rate of erosion is higher in the recent interval, reflecting stronger climate-driven processes. Recent climate warming in the study area has been accompanied by an intensification of extreme events such as storms (e.g. ocean swell). The situation is becoming more pronounced due to the progressively reduced period of winter shore ice. Depending on the anemometric conditions, the Calypsostranda coast is modified by wind waves, and consequently longshore currents and associated sediment movement.

AB  - When pasture supply becomes limiting during the summer dry period in the southern North Island of New Zealand, dairy cows often receive silage and forage crop dietary supplements. The present study investigated the effect of dietary change in late summer-autumn on cow's urinary N excretion. Fifty-four dairy cows balanced for milk production, age, liveweight, body condition score and days in milk were allocated into three feeding treatments, high crude protein (HCP, grazing pasture only), medium crude protein (MCP, leafy turnips and silages during the day and grazing of pasture at night) and low crude protein (LCP, leafy turnips and silages). Urinary N concentrations were greatest for the HCP group, with no significant difference between the MCP and LCP groups. The percentage of urinary N as urea was 84, 61 and 52% for the HCP, MCP and LCP treatments respectively. Urine urea was more responsive to dietary changes and management than total urinary N. Urinary N:creatinine ratios were strongly related to dietary N surplus. Feeding a mix of silage and turnips in addition to grazing pasture is a viable option to reduce excretion of N to the environment without compromising productivity of lactating cows during summer and autumn.

AB  - Soil erosion refers to the detachment and removal of soil particles from land (topsoil), by the natural physical forces (water, glacier and wind). Soil erosion causes soil loss in the catchment or any land areas severely impacting agriculture activity, sedimentation in the dam reservoirs, and hampering developmental activities. Therefore, it is desirable to accurately measure soil loss due to erosion for the development and management of an area. With this objective, a well-known machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been used in the development of the soil loss prediction model. Eight erosion affecting variable inputs: ambient temperature Tair, rainfall, Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC), rainfall intensity, slope, vegetation cover, soil temperature Tsoil and moisture of the soil. Data on published literature was used in the model study. The accuracy of the proposed SVM was assessed by using three statistical performance evaluation indicators namely Person correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MAE). Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) was used to investigate the dependence of prediction results of eight input variables used in the model study. Model validation results showed that SVM model performed well for the prediction of soil loss for testing (R = 0.8993) and also for training (R = 0.9123). Rainfall intensity and vegetation cover were found to be the two most important affecting input parameters for the soil loss prediction.

AB  - The review presents information on epizootic diseases in marine mammals caused by influenza viruses of genera A and B, morbilliviruses, adeno-, herpes-, calici- and coronoviruses. Virological and serological data about the spectrum of viral infections in marine mammals are given. Describes epizootic events in marine mammals induced by influenza A viruses and isolation of strains with antigenic formulas H1N1, H1N3, H3N3, H3N8, H4N5, H4N6, H7N7, H10N7, H13N2, H13N9. It is suggested that the seals may be infected with a wide range of influenza viruses by direct transmission without prior adaptation. It is emphasized that marine pinnipeds can serve as one of the reservoirs of human influenza B virus in nature. Data on the classification of pinniped and cetacean coronaviruses are presented. A variety of pinnipeds herpesviruses and the clinical significance of their morbidity indicators in the diagnosis of viral infections of seals are shown. It emphasizes the need for the development of proactive diagnostic tools for the timely detection of new viruses with zoonotic potential that can cause disease outbreaks. The negative effects of diseases with unknown etiologies on the population of Caspian seals are noted. The conclusion is made about the need for metagenomic monitoring of Caspian seal virome in order to establish the role of viral pathogens in their morbidity and regular mortality under conditions of intensive habitat development.

AB  - In recent years, with more open data platforms and tools available to store and process satellite imagery, Earth Observation data have become widely accessible and usable especially for countries previously not in the possession of tasking rights to satellites and the needed processing capacity. Due to its ideal scanning and acquisition conditions for low cloud coverage imagery, Namibia aims to make use of this new development and integrate Earth Observation data into its national monitoring system of sustainable development goals (SDG). The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of open source tools and global datasets to estimate the national SDG indicators on Change of water-related ecosystems (6.6.1), Rural population with access to roads (9.1.1), Forest coverage (15.1.1) and Land degradation (15.3.1). The results are set into perspective of existing information in each particular sector. The study shows that, in the absence of in-situ measurements or data collected through surveys, the Earth Observation-based results represent a high potential to supplement the national statistics for Namibia or to serve as primary data sources once validated through ground-truthing. Furthermore, examples are given for the limitations of the assessed Earth Observation solutions in the context of Namibia. Hence, the study also serves as valuable input for discussions on a consensus on national definitions and standards by all stakeholders responsible for releasing official statistics.

AB  - The cyclical character of definite processes observed under both Polish and American conditions in fact emerges as of a universal nature, finding its analogies throughout the world, though first and foremost within the European cultural circle. It is also possible to speak of its far reaching synchronicity, encompassing change on both local and global scales. This is witnessed by successive culminations of cycles with the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, the revolutionary surges of the 1830s and 1840s, the events of the 1860s and 1870s, the turbulences and wars of the early 20th century (notably World War I), then World War II, the great transformations of the 1980s, and the recently observed increase in political tension in various parts of the world (e.g. the Middle East, Ukraine, etc.). In the economic sphere the symptoms are shifts in the business climate, which can even be calculated by reference to quantitative indicators. Then, in the sphere of culture, it is possible to denote successive periods in literature and the arts. In the political sphere in turn, events that shape the state or territorial order are to be observed readily. The present article thus seeks to propose the existence of a universal and synchronous 30-40 years long generation cycle, which manifests itself in real symptoms in the world of politics, and for instance in the cyclicity seen to characterise intensity of change on the political map of Europe.

AB  - According to EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region, Lithuania has to ensure sustainable growth, gain and maintain good condition of marine environment until 2020. In accordance with the sustainability approach, every potential cost and energy cutting as well as social sustainability measure for wastewater treatment should be explored. Nonetheless, Lithuania wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the sustainability context have never been evaluated before. A comprehensive set of 30 sustainable development indicators (SDI) (9 functional, 11 environmental, 5 economical and 6 socio-cultural) in connection with functional unit were applied to medium-sized Jurbarkas WWTP (with a capacity of 2,540 m(3)/d). Sustainability evaluation involved life cycle of WWTP maintenance phase as well as water inlet, outlet and manufacturing. Results revealed that in the general context of sustainability the stability of plant varied greatly. Nine SDI haven't reached the sustainability approach. Graphically plotted results in the four sustainability categories have shown that relatively highest environmental impact regarding the maximum covered plot is caused due to an economical unsustainability. Operational and maintenance costs per volume of wastewater treated were approximately 2.23 higher than the cost to consumers per one cubic meter of wastewater treated, therefore depreciation, repairs, material costs and wastewater treatment costs accounted to 87%. Methodology by using SDI for estimating sustainability of WWTP is adaptable to different capacity or technology of WWTP, comparable, simple to develop and improve.

AB  - As a result of the existence of organisms and suspended particles under underwater conditions, images captured under water usually have low contrast, color distortion and loss of visibility. At the same time, due to the existence of the artificial light source, the underwater image usually has the non-uniform illumination. Traditional hazy-removal methods perform poorly under water. In order to take both absorption and scattering into consideration, a new underwater image formation model and restoration methods are proposed recently. However, these methods ignore the great impact of the red channel information and artificial light source. To solve this problem, a new approach is proposed for underwater image visibility restoration. Firstly, a threshold is set to determine whether to use the red channel information to estimate the dark channel, and a saturation indicator which is used to indicate the impact of artificial light source is utilized to calculate the scattering rate. Based on the red channel information anticipation and the saturation indicator, a new method is proposed to estimate the dark channel. Then, the transmission of each channel is estimated according to the attenuation coefficient ratio, which makes the proposed method more robust. Finally, the ambient light is obtained using the Shades of Gray algorithm, and the visibility restoration result is achieved based on a new underwater image formation model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the contrast of the underwater image with more natural color and better visibility.

AB  - Eucalyptus plantations have become increasingly common in Latin America. However, because Eucalyptus is an exotic species, its presence has raised concerns about changes in the environment, especially to soil properties. The objective of this study was to investigate possible changes in selected soil enzyme activity after several years of Eucalyptus cultivation. Soil samples were collected from four locations: a native forest (Atlantic Forest) used as a reference for the original soil conditions and three E. grandis plantations aged 2, 3 and 5years, established in 2008, 2007 and 2005, respectively. The native vegetation had been removed and the soil graded and ploughed to establish these plantations. We evaluated soil enzymatic activities (-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, dehydrogenase, urease and arylsulfatase) at each location. The activity of -glucosidase, phosphatase, dehydrogenase and urease was improved after 5years, whereas arylsulphatase was impacted negatively. The multivariate analysis showed that the majority of enzyme activities reached the values observed in native forest after the third year of reforestation. The activity of -glucosidase was crucial in differentiating the area with 2years of reforestation from the native forest. The removal of native vegetation in order to establish commercial plantations raises concerns about the real impacts of this practice on the soil. In the present study, plantations of Eucalyptus improved most of the selected enzyme activities after the third year of reforestation. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Faecal coliform (FC) bacteria were used as a proxy of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) to assess the microbiological pollution risk for eight mesoscale catchments with increasing lowland influence across north-east Scotland. This study sought to assess the impact of urban areas on microbial contaminant fluxes. Fluxes were lowest in upland catchments where populations are relatively low. By contrast, lowland catchments with larger settlements and a greater number of grazing populations have more elevated FC concentrations throughout the year. Peak FC counts occurred during the summer months (April-September) when biological activity is at its highest. Lowland catchments experience high FC concentrations throughout the year whereas upland catchments exhibit more seasonal variations with elevated summer conditions and reduced winter concentrations. A simple linear regression model based on catchment characteristics provided scope to predict FC fluxes. Percentage of improved grazing pasture and human population explained 90 and 62 % of the variation in mean annual FC concentrations. This approach provides scope for an initial screening tool to predict the impact of urban space and agricultural practice on FC concentrations at the catchment scale and can aid in pragmatic planning and water quality improvement decisions. However, greater understanding of the short-term dynamics is still required which would benefit from higher resolution sampling than the approach undertaken here.

AB  - Research was conducted, which aim was to evaluate quantitative and qualitative PCB changes in sewage sludge during mesophilic digestion, and the influence of those compound concentration above acceptable level (1.9 mg kg(-1) of sludge dry matter), also nickel and cadmium ions, on mesophilic digestion process. Before and after the digestion, concentration of seven PCB congeners, Ni and Cd in particular chemical fractions of the sludge was analyzed.
   During mesophilic digestion it was stated that increased PCB and heavy metal ions content in sewage sludge, did not disturb correct progress of the process. Last days of digestion were important for intensive degradation of higher chlorinated PCB to congeners containing less chlorine atoms in particle. In liquid of sludge with increased PCB content, up until the 14th day of mesophilic digestion process, gradual increase in amount and sorts of indicator PCB congeners was observed. First LCB were released into sludge liquid. Total amount of PCB in sludge after digestion was decreased significantly, which indicate that biological degradation of those compounds under anaerobic conditions, and/or biosorption of those compounds, proceeded. It has been proved that the digestion of sludge excessively loaded with nickel ions can lead to an adverse accumulation of this metal in the exchangeable and carbonate fraction of stabilized sludge.

AB  - To study the adaptive mechanisms of host and symbiont in a decrease in pH, coral branches of Pocillopora capitata from La Boquita reef in the Bay of Santiago, Mexico were assigned to experimental units (n=38 per treatment) and three pH treatments were evaluated: (a) pH 8.00-8.40 (control; Treatment C-1), (b) pH 7.85-7.95 (Treatment C-2) and (c) pH 7.60-7.70 (Treatment C-3). Corals were collected at the beginning of the experiment (T-0) and at different times: T-1 (5h), T-2 (12h), T-3 (48h) and T-4 (168h). We examined malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and CAT), antioxidant capacity and chlorophyll a (Chl a) content. The results showed a different response to the treatment between zooxanthellae and Cnidaria tissues. Initially in zooxanthellae, we observed a SOD response for the C-3 treatment; however this response did not prevent lipid degradation. In Cnidaria, the C-3 resulted in a greater SOD activity from the middle to the end of the experiment. The results improve our understanding of the effects of ocean acidification, the ability of coral to respond to environmental changes and the use of biochemical indicators related to the physiological condition for the recognition of coral communities affected by a decreases in pH.

AB  - Therapeutic communities (TCs) for addictions are drug-free environments in which people with addictive problems live together in an organized and structured way to promote change toward recovery and reinsertion in society. Despite a long research tradition in TCs, the evidence base for the effectiveness of TCs is limited according to available reviews. Since most of these studies applied a selective focus, we made a comprehensive systematic review of all controlled studies that compared the effectiveness of TCs for addictions with that of a control condition. The focus of this paper is on recovery, including attention for various life domains and a longitudinal scope. We searched the following databases: ISI Web of Knowledge (WoS), PubMed, and DrugScope. Our search strategy revealed 997 hits. Eventually, 30 publications were selected for this paper, which were based on 16 original studies. Two out of three studies showed significantly better substance use and legal outcomes among TC participants, and five studies found superior employment and psychological functioning. Length of stay in treatment and participation in subsequent aftercare were consistent predictors of recovery status. We conclude that TCs can promote change regarding various outcome categories. Since recovering addicts often cycle between abstinence and relapse, a continuing care approach is advisable, including assessment of multiple and subjective outcome indicators.

AB  - Recovery of photosynthesis and transpiration is strongly restricted by low temperatures in air and/or soil during the transition period from winter to spring in boreal zones. The extent to which air temperature (T-a) and soil temperature (T-s) influence the seasonality of photosynthesis and transpiration of a boreal spruce ecosystem was investigated using a process-based ecosystem model (CoupModel) together with eddy covariance (EC) data from one eddy flux tower and nearby soil measurements at Knottasen, Sweden. A Monte Carlo-based uncertainty method (GLUE) provided prior and posterior distributions of simulations representing a wide range of soil conditions and performance indicators. The simulated results showed sufficient flexibility to predict the measured cold and warm Ts in the moist and dry plots around the eddy flux tower. Moreover, the model presented a general ability to describe both biotic and abiotic processes for the Norway spruce stand. The dynamics of sensible heat fluxes were well described by the corresponding latent heat fluxes and net ecosystem exchange of CO2. The parameter ranges obtained are probably valid to represent regional characteristics of boreal conifer forests, but were not easy to constrain to a smaller range than that produced by the assumed prior distributions. Finally, neglecting the soil temperature response function resulted in fewer behavioural models and probably more compensatory errors in other response functions for regulating the seasonality of ecosystem fluxes.

AB  - Gene function studies in anthurium (Anthurium andraeanum) have been hindered by the low efficiency of stable transformation, the long regeneration time required as well as the genotype-dependent nature of Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumemaciens)-mediated transformation protocols. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assays can serve as an attractive alternative for investigating gene function once such assays are optimized. The effects of host factors (genotype, explant type, and developmental maturity of explants), Agrobacterium factors (strain, growth phase, and its concentration), media conditions (infiltration medium used, acetosyringone concentration, type of surfactant, and its concentration), and other experimental factors (infiltration time, cocultivation time, and vacuum infiltration) were investigated on the efficiency of Agrobacterium transient transformation, with replications, using transient expression of beta-glucuronidase as an indicator. Although the efficiency of transient transformation was initially found to be highly host genotype-dependent, the genotypic differences in transient transformation efficiency diminished as the protocol was optimized. Agrobacterium strain GV3101 grown to an optical density at 600 nM (OD600) of 1.5 and resuspended to a final OD600 of 0.8 in infiltration medium 10.5% glucose, 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid| supplemented with 100 mu M acetosyringone and 0.05% of a non-ionic surfactant (S240), for an infiltration period of 16 hours and a cocultivation timeframe of 2 days yielded transient transformation efficiencies as high as 100%.

AB  - Producing refrigeration and/or air conditioning from solar energy remains an inviting prospect, given that a typical building's cooling load peaks within 2 or 3 h of the time of maximum solar irradiation. The attractiveness of "free" cooling obtained from the sun has spawned a wealth of research over the last several decades, as summarized in a number of review articles. Obstacles-especially high initial costs-remain to the widespread commercialization of solar cooling technologies. It is not clear at the present time if thermally driven systems will prove to be more competitive than electrically driven systems. We therefore describe a technical and economic comparison of existing solar cooling approaches, including both thermally and electrically driven. We compare the initial costs of each technology, including projections about future costs of solar electric and solar thermal systems. Additionally we include estimates of the environmental impacts of the key components in each solar cooling system presented. One measure of particular importance for social acceptance of solar cooling technologies is the required "footprint," or collector area, necessary for a given cooling capacity. We conclude with recommendations for future research and development to stimulate broader acceptance of solar cooling. The projections made show that solar electric cooling will require the lowest capital investment in 2030 due to the high COPs of vapor compression refrigeration and strong cost reduction targets for PV technology.

AB  - Groundwater is a key resource for global agricultural production but is vulnerable to a changing climate. Given significant uncertainty about future impacts, bottom-up approaches for developing adaptive capacity are a more appropriate paradigm than seeking optimal adaptation strategies that assume a high ability to predict future risks or outcomes. This paper analyses the groundwater management practices adopted at multiple scales in East Anglia, UK, to identify wider lessons for developing adaptive capacity within groundwater management. Key elements are (1) horizontal and vertical integration within resource management; (2) making better use of water resources, at all scales, which vary in space and time; (3) embedding adaptation at multiple scales (from farm to national) within an adaptive management framework which allows strategies and management decisions to be updated in the light of changing understanding or conditions; (4) facilitating the ongoing formation through collective action of local Water Abstractor Groups; (5) promoting efficient use of scarce water resources by these groups, so as to increase their power to negotiate over possible short-term license restrictions; (6) controlling abstractions within a sustainable resource management framework, whether at national (regulatory) or at local (Abstractor Group) scales, that takes account of environmental water needs; and (7) reducing non-climate pressures which have the potential to further reduce the availability of usable groundwater.

AB  - Ratiometric fluorescence sensing is a useful technique for the precise and quantitative analysis of biological events occurring under complex conditions, such as those inside cells. We report herein the design of new ratiometric chemosensors for nucleoside polyphosphates such as ATP that are based on binding-induced modulation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) coupled with a turn-on fluorescence-sensing mechanism. We designed these new FRET-based ratiometric chemosensors by utilizing spectral overlap changes to modulate the FRET efficiency. Introduction of coumarin fluorophores as the FRET donors into a binuclear zinc complex as the FRET acceptor provided the ratiometric chemosensors. These chemosensors exhibited a clear dual-mission signal change upon binding with strong affinity (K-app approximate to 10(6)-10(7) M-1) to nucleoside polyphosphates in aqueous solution, whereas no detectable emission change was observed with monophosphates and phosphodiester species or various other anions. These chemosensors were used for real-time fluorescence monitoring of enzyme reactions such as saccharide synthesis by glycosyltransferase and phosphorylation by protein kinase, both of which involve nucleoside polyphosphates as substrates. The utility of ratiometric sensing by chemosensors was further demonstrated in a fluorescence-imaging study of the nucleoside polyphosphates inside living cells, wherein we ratiometrically visualized the stimulus-responsive concentration change of ATP, an indicator of the cellular energy level.

KW  - GROWTH-MODEL
AB  - The aim of this work is to calibrate and validate the adaptation of TOMGRO (TOMato GRowth), a crop growth simulation model for tomato, to the short-term cropping technique and to conditions in Greece. Current practice in plastic greenhouses in Mediterranean regions is to stop the indeterminate development of the plant after a limited number of trusses by removing the terminal bud of the plant (i.e. topping). Experiments were carried out in the farm of the University of Thessaly, Volos, Greece, during the autumn and winter periods of 2005 and 2007. Crop development, growth and greenhouse climate were measured. Results showed that dry matter partitioning in the plant was not altered by the topping of the plant but the duration of the life of the fruit, from setting to maturity, was shortened. The TOMGRO model was modified accordingly, calibrated over the winter 2005 data and then using data from winter 2007. Good agreement was observed between the measured and simulated plant development indicators, biomass and fruit production. Satisfactory agreement was obtained for the plant leaf area (LA), usually one of the weak points of TOMGRO. Based on these results, we conclude that this adaptation of TOMGRO accurately simulates the development of short-term tomato crops grown in greenhouses and can therefore be used for decision support to help growers optimise the operation of the greenhouse.

AB  - Coordinated acoustic and trawl surveys were performed to locate aggregations of adult eulachon Thaleichthys pacificus in the lower Fraser River, British Columbia, during spring 2001 and 2002. Aggregations were encountered in one portion of the study area in both years. They contained mature, spawning, and spent eulachon of both sexes, of which over 80% were spent males. These groups were 880-2,000 m long and averaged 117-140 m wide. Within them, mean fish density was 0.27-0.29 fish/m(3) and species composition was 87-99% eulachon. They occurred in 6-8.5 In of water over substrate that was mainly sand with a small fraction of pea gravel. We did not determine whether these eulachon spawned in that area or had congregated there for another purpose, such as holding or migration. Other species occasionally encountered in appreciable numbers were juvenile pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and chum salmon O. keta. Mean in situ target strengths of eulachon were -53.3 dB at 123 kHz and -50.3 dB at 208 kHz. Coordinated acoustics and trawling were effective for locating eulachon aggregations at low to moderate flows (river discharge of 3,200 m(3)/S or less), but were hampered by entrained debris during higher flows of spring runoff. Under suitable river conditions, the high resolution and rapid spatial coverage of this technique are apt for habitat preference studies and point source environmental assessments in large, turbid rivers.

AB  - Sedimentary sequences within headwater valleys on the landward side of the Great Escarpment of South Africa are elucidated and their significance as indicators of environmental change is assessed. This study focuses on the Sneeuberg Range, the most prominent mountain range in the semi-arid central Great Karoo. Valley fills of a hitherto unrecognised complexity and of a greater age than any previously recorded in the central Great Karoo are reported. Three phases of deposition spanning the Late Pleistocene up to the present are documented from sites where gully erosion has incised the valley fills. The earliest depositional phase is represented by deeply weathered, calcretised gravel deposits, which probably were emplaced by debris flow and fluvial processes in the form of a fan. These deposits subsequently were buried by finer grained, largely unconsolidated sediment, with Much of this emplacement occurring during the Holocene. There is evidence for phases of landscape stability and instability within this facies. Finally, sheetwash has removed fine-grained sediments from valley flanks and has deposited it either on valley bottoms, or in presently active gullies. This process appears to be ongoing, and is the subject of current investigation. The sedimentary deposits are interpreted as representing a wide range of palaeoenvironmental conditions that have prevailed within the central Great Karoo since the penultimate glaciation.

AB  - Background: Kraepelin originally conceptualized schizophrenia as a degenerative brain disorder Ir remains unclear whether the illness is characterized bq a static encephalopathy or a deterioration of brain function, or periods of each condition, Assessments of cognitive function, as measured by neuropsychologic assessment, can provide additional insight into this question. Few studies of patients with schizophrenia have investigated the effect of aging on executive functions, in an extensive neuropsychologic battery across a wide age range, compared to healthy volunteers.
   Methods: We examined the interaction of aging and neuropsychologic function in schizophrenia through a cross-sectional study in patients (n = 87) and healthy control subjects (n = 94), Subjects were divided into three age groups (20-35 36-49, and 50-75), and performance on an extensive neuropsychologic battery was evaluated
   Results: Compared to control subjects, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated similar age-related declines across most neuropsychologic functions, with the exception of abstraction ability, in which significant evidence of a more accelerated decline was observed.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with previous reports indicating similar age effects on most aspects of cognition in patients with schizophrenia and healthy adults, but they support the hypothesis that a degenerative process may result in a more accelerated decline of some executive functions in older age in schizophrenia.

AB  - Simple Summary Canine aggression over resources such as food or edible chews is commonly termed food guarding or food aggression. Food aggression directed at humans is relatively common in dogs, including dogs that enter animal shelters. While food aggression is part of dogs' normal behavior, little is known about why some dogs show food aggression, but others do not. Common animal shelter "lore" suggests that dogs that are underweight or were previously starved are more likely than normal-weight dogs to show aggression toward a human that approaches while the dog is eating. It is assumed that the value of food to the dog is increased by experience with food scarcity, and the value remains elevated even after food is no longer scarce. We tested this common belief by analyzing data from 900 dogs from criminal cruelty cases to look for a relationship between the dogs' weight and human-directed food aggression. Contrary to common belief, we found that underweight dogs were not more likely than normal-weight dogs to be food aggressive. Based on these results, human-directed food aggression is not a reliable indicator of past food scarcity. This has implications for criminal proceedings, as dogs can have previously experienced starvation without obvious residual behavioral indications in the shelter.
   Abstract It is commonly believed that underweight or emaciated dogs are predisposed to food aggression toward humans. Each year, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) receives hundreds of dogs from criminal cruelty cases. The dogs range from emaciated to overweight. We analyzed existing data from 900 such dogs to examine the relationship between body condition score and food and chew item aggression toward humans. Across all types of cruelty cases, 9.2% of dogs were aggressive over the food, chew, or both, which is a lower prevalence than that previously reported among shelter dogs. Dogs from cruelty cases originating in New York City were more likely to show aggression over food (z = 3.91, p < 0.001) and chew items (z = 2.61, p = 0.01) than dogs from large-scale cruelty cases, although it is unclear why. Female dogs were less likely to show food (z = -3.75, p < 0.001) and chew item (z = -2.25, p = 0.02) aggression compared to males. Underweight dogs were not more likely to display food aggression, but when they did, the aggression was no more severe than that of normal-weight dogs (Fisher's exact tests = 0.41 and 0.15 for the Food Bowl and Chew Item scenarios, respectively). Breed type was not a significant predictor of aggression. Canine food aggression does not appear to be an aberrant behavior caused by a history of food scarcity but may be related to biological factors such as sex. These findings could prove useful for animal behavior subject matter experts testifying in court or consulting on cruelty cases, as they could speak with scientific validity to the question of whether there is a link between previous food scarcity and the likelihood of food aggression in dogs.

AB  - The carbon science community must rely on satellite remote sensing to obtain global estimates of photosynthetic activity, typically expressed as net primary production (NPP), gross primary production (GPP) or light use efficiency (LUE). The photochemical reflectance index (PRI), calculated as a normalized difference reflectance index using a physiologically active green band (similar to 531 nm) and another physiologically insensitive green reference band (similar to 570 nm), denoted as PRI(570), has been confirmed in many studies as being strongly related to LUE. Here, we examined the potential of utilizing PRI(570) observations under different illumination conditions for canopy LUE estimation of a forest. In order to evaluate this, directional hyperspectral reflectance measurements were collected continuously throughout the daytime periods using an automated spectroradiometer in conjunction with tower-based eddy covariance fluxes and environmental measurements at a coastal conifer forest in British Columbia, Canada throughout the 2006 growing season. A parameter calculated as the PRI(570) difference (dPRI(570)) between shaded versus sunlit canopy foliage sectors showed a strong correlation to tower-based LUE. The seasonal pattern for this correlation produced a dramatic change from high negative (r similar to -0.80) values in the springtime and early fall to high positive values (r similar to 0.80) during the summer months, which could represent the seasonality of physiological characteristics and environmental factors. Although the PRI(570) successfully tracked canopy LUE, one or both of its green bands (similar to 531 and 570 nm) used to calculate the PRI are unavailable on most existing and planned near-term satellites. Therefore, we examined the potential to use 24 other spectral indexes for LUE monitoring that might be correlated to PRI, and thereby a substitute for it. We also continued our previous investigations into the influence of illumination conditions on the observed PRI(570) and other indexes. Among the 24 indexes examined, three PRI indexes using different reference bands (488, 551 and 705 nm) showed high correlations to the traditional PRI(570), especially PRI(551) and PRI(705). This indicates three additional PRI variations for LUE monitoring if the traditional reference band at 570 nm is not available but the 531 nm band is available. Five other indexes also yielded high correlations to PRI(570): Dmax and DM705, two indexes calculated from derivative reflectance spectra; a simple ratio of reflectance values at 685 nm and 655 nm (SR685_655); and a double-peak optical index (DPI). The diurnal and seasonal dynamics of these eight indexes and PRI(570) were explored. All of these indexes except DPI expressed linear dependence on available sunlight and more strongly expressed diurnal dynamics in April than in August during summer drought. The differences for shaded versus sunlit canopy foliage sectors were also calculated for the eight indexes, and their correlations to canopy LUE across the season were examined. The performances were similar for the most successful and seasonally stable indexes: dPRI(551), dPRI(705) and dPRI(570). The other five indexes showed good correlation to LUE in some but not all the months, and the months with high correlations varied among them.

AB  - The Sr/Ba ratio is a geochemical indicator that distinguishes between terrestrial and marine sedimentary environments in terrigenous clastic sediments. However, conclusions drawn from the Sr/Ba ratio is often inconsistent with those drawn from other sedimentary environment indicators during practical application; therefore, the usability of this indicator is not widely acknowledged. First, to verify this theory and accurately determine the differences between the sedimentary geochemical behaviours of Sr and Ba under different salinity conditions, 14 artificial deltaic sediments were prepared by mixing clean seawater and muddy river water in varying proportions to produce different constant salinities, ranging from 0.0 to 31.2 psu. The Sr and Ba concentrations in the different fractions were then examined via sequential extraction. The experimental results show that, on average, 87% of the total Ba and 65% of the total Sr in the 14 artificial deltaic sediments existed in the residual fraction that is independent of the geochemical conditions of the depositional environment. The experiment also revealed that the decrease in Ba in the sediments was caused by the desorption of adsorbed Ba, owing to the addition of seawater with increasing salinity. Furthermore, the Sr/Ba ratio in the exchangeable fraction yielded a strong linear correlation with salinity, and the Sr/Ba ratio in the carbonate-bound fraction tended to increase slightly with increasing salinity, the Sr/Ba ratios in the Fe-Mn oxide-bound, organic and reductive, and residual fractions, and the total Sr/Ba ratio were not significantly correlated with salinity. Therefore, the Sr/Ba ratio (Sr/Ba-HAc) of exchangeable and carbonate-bound Sr and Ba extracted using dilute acetic acid (HAc) and the Sr/Ba ratio (Sr/Ba-NH4Ac) of exchangeable Sr and Ba extracted using ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) can be used to distinguish between marine and terrestrial sedimentary environments. If the Sr/Ba-HAc or Sr/Ba-NH(4)Ac( )ratio in the sediment is > 1.0, it can be considered to have been deposited in a sedimentary environment affected by seawater with a salinity > 5.0 psu. Second, to verify the aforementioned conclusions, the Sr and Ba in 24 field samples from the Yangtze River Delta were extracted using 10% HAc or 1.0 M NH4Ac. The results indicate that the increase in the amount of Sr in the estuarine terrigenous clastic sediments from the river to the marine environments is caused by the addition of Sr-rich, Ba-poor, marine carbonate shells. The extracted Sr/Ba-HAc ratios were < 1.0 in freshwater (fluvial), 1.0-3.0 in brackish water (delta front), 3.0-8.0 in saltwater (prodelta), and > 8.0 in normal seawater (neritic environments and relict sand); however, in the traditional bulk analysis, total Sr/Ba ratio did not change significantly with increasing salinity. Therefore, it is suggested that the selective extraction of sedimentogenic Sr and Ba is the only effective means of using the Sr/Ba ratio to discriminate between marine and terrestrial sedimentary environments in terrigenous clastic sediments, while the traditional method of using the total Sr/Ba ratio of whole samples is unsuitable.

AB  - We explore the agroecosystem energy flows in two former communist countries, Czechia and Poland, in the two decades after the fall of the totalitarian regimes. Energetic agroecosystem productivity, i.e., the energy content of crops, livestock products per unit of area is compared to energy inputs, i.e., external inputs from society, i.e., labour, industrial inputs, and external biomass inputs and linked to land use change and demographic and economic changes. Using the social metabolism concept and the Material and Energy Flow Accounting method, our analysis looks at the system from a biophysical perspective and explores the interactions between the economic system and nature. We calculate the Energy Return On Investment (EROI) indicators and also present an easily understandable index for policy makers, the Input/Output Index.
   After the end of communism in both countries in 1989, they both joined the EU in 2004. Along with this, both states started the integration towards a global economy. Our main research questions are 1) to what extent does the development of the energy flows and energy efficiency depend on the political organisation and the socioeconomic conditions and 2) if it follows rather more general trends or if it depends on the socioeconomic structure of the agricultural system.
   In the first decade immediately after 1990, the agricultural production radically slumped in both countries together with an overall slowdown of the economic performance. The production started to grow again and stabilised in the second decade mainly due to joining the EU in 2004. The integration to the global markets raised the volume of trade by a factor of 5 in Czechia and 10 in Poland. The number of agricultural workers decreased 1/3 in both countries over the whole period. Also, the cropland has been decreasing in both countries by about 20% and production has concentrated to more fertile areas, while the abandonment of agricultural area occurred mainly in less favoured areas. Both agricultural systems underwent structural changes in respect of change of ownership, economic conditions and subsequently the structure of production. Recently, the crops of economic significance dominate and Czechia exports raw materials as e.g., cereals and oil crops, and imports mainly fruits, vegetables and processed food. Poland has become an important producer and exporter of agricultural products in Europe (fruits, meat). But this is rather an issue of scale than of gaining efficiency. Poland is less efficient in the case of its share of inputs per outputs of energy flows with 21% while Czechia is 17%. Final EROI is stable in both countries. In Czechia, it is slightly improving from 0.6 in 1993 to 1 in 2012, while in Poland, the FEROI is stagnating around 0.6. The External Final EROI has slightly improved in Czechia from 2.8 to 3.8, while in Poland, it has been continuously decreasing from 2.6 to 2.2. The Internal Final EROI shows a declining share of the biomass reused in Czechia: from 0.8 to 1.4, while keeping its volumes in Poland at the value of 0.8.

AB  - Background: The clinical evaluation of captive large felids has been a challenge for veterinarians and the diversity of management of this animals can complicate the standardization of hematologic parameters to these species. Red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and platelet counts were measured, as well as plasma fibrinogen levels, from captive lions and Siberian tigers in Brazil. The objective of this study is to provide veterinarians an additional source of information concerning the reference values of hematologic parameters of lions and Siberian tigers.
   Materials, Methods & Results: This study presents the hematologic parameters of 29 captive lions (Panthera leo) and 16 captive Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) from the Zoological Park of Sao Paulo Foundation. For inclusion in the experiment, animals were clinically examined, and those with recent physiological and/or concurrent alterations, those who were receiving any type of medication, those with an inadequate body condition score, those with dehydration, and those infested by ectoparasites or affected by some disease were excluded. The animals were chemically restrained on their own premises using anesthetic darts containing ketamine and xylazine. Blood samples were collected by jugular, cephalic or saphenous venipuncture. The appropriated volume intended for a hemogram evaluation was collected in tubes containing 2.7 nM Na-2 EDTA, to preserving the ideal ratio of blood to anticoagulant. For statistical analysis, Unpaired Student t tests were performed and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. No significant differences were found in the hematological values between male and female lions, except for the mature neutrophils values, which was higher in males. In Siberian tigers, the hemogram revealed significant differences between male and female counts for the number of leukocytes, mature neutrophils and lymphocytes. Leukocytes and mature neutrophils were higher in males whereas lymphocytes were higher in females.
   Discussion: Hematology is an efficient method for assessing the physiological status of individuals and often provides the first and only indicator of a disease. The results found are similar to what has been described in the literature. However, biological, methodological and analytical factors, along with their respective biases influence the hematological investigation of captive wild animals, and new reports may contribute to an expansion of the normal parameter ranges found by several authors. In this study, the three youngest of the 13 sampled Siberian tigers were approximately 11 months of age, and showed no differences in the evaluated clinical pathology values when compared with values from the adult Siberian tigers. Most likely, these three youngest Siberian tigers had already reached adult levels of the parameters investigated. Comparing the white blood cell values between male and female of lions and Siberian tigers, only tigers showed higher values of leukocytes in males (10.45 x 10(3)/mu L) than in females (7.37 x 10(3)/mu L), which may be explained by the reluctance of male Siberian tigers to being captured and higher levels of stress experienced by these individuals. This difference was attributed to females being better conditioned to the stress of capture, because they were more frequently handled for research projects.

AB  - Interpersonal relationships are an important and integral part of numerous social science research agendas. Analytical tools have been created in the last 10 years that model dyadic interactions. In particular, this article focuses on the dyadic models of Fienberg and Wasserman [Fienberg, S.E., Wasserman, S., 1981. Categorical data analysis of single sociometric relations. In: Leinhardt, S. (Ed.), Sociological Methodology. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco.], Holland and Leinhardt [Holland, P.W., Leinhardt, S., 1981. An exponential family of probability densities for directed graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 76 (1981) 33-51.], Iacobucci and Wasserman [Iacobucci, D., Wasserman, S., 1988. A general framework for the statistical analysis of sequential dyadic interaction data Psychological Bulletin 103 (1988) 379-390.] and Wasserman and Iacobucci [Wasserman, S., Iacobucci, D., 1986. Statistical analysis of discrete relational data. British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology 39 (1986) 41-64.]. However, measurement issues like reliability and validity, as discussed by Alien and Yen [Allen, M.J., Yen, W.M., 1979. Introduction to Measurement Theory. Brooks/Cole, Monterey, CA, 1979.], Nunnally [Nunnally, J., 1978. Psychometric Theory, 2nd edn. McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 1978.] and Uebersax [Uebersax, J.S., 1988. Validity inferences from interobserver agreement. Psychological Bulletin 104 (1988) 405-416.], have not been considered in conjunction with these models, and little is known about the empirical performance of the dyadic models under sub-optimal measurement quality conditions. We offer two essential approaches to ascertaining the level of measurement error in the observed indicators of social ties and relationships. The first approach combines latent class and social network models in one integrated framework: and allows for the simultaneous study of measurement and dyadic structural issues. The second approach is an alternative that may be more useful to social science researchers, both because the method is more accessible and because researchers could apply the techniques to data they have already partially analyzed. This approach is a two-staged procedure whereby in the first stage, a probability model based on latent class analysis is estimated which provides an indication of the measurement quality in the data In the second stage, traditional social network models are estimated. To investigate the implications of different levels of measurement error for interpreting the nature of the network ties and the dyadic parametric performance, we also designed a Monte Carlo experiment. Measurement error is simulated as the likelihood of a binary relational choice (for simplicity) being inaccurately classified, where incorrect diagnoses can result from poor interitem agreement (i.e., unreliability) or poor interrater agreement. The simulation can be used by researchers in combination with the two-stage approach. The results of the simulation provide guidelines for situations when social network models can withstand a reasonable degree of sub-optimal measurement quality and highlight adverse conditions which can significantly affect the performance of the modeling approach. Further, the simulation shows that sample size assists in reducing the chances of making Type II errors, but it does not compensate for biases in parameter estimates in the presence of increasing error.
   Finally, the measurement and dyadic analytical methods are applied to a real dataset describing interorganizational relational activity using multiple raters. Recommendations are offered to guide the researcher in making decisions about research design when using dyadic models. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Poor housing conditions, such as poor building materials and weak structures as well as high levels of indoor air pollution, are important risk factors for a broad range of diseases, including acute respiratory infections (ARI). In mining areas, research on the determinants of respiratory health predominantly focuses on exposures to outdoor air pollutants deriving from mining operations. However, mining projects also influence the socioeconomic status of households, which, in turn, affect housing quality and individual behaviors and, thus, housing quality and levels of indoor air pollution. In this study, we aimed to determine how proximity to an industrial mining project impacts housing quality, sources of indoor air pollution, and prevalence of ARI. Methods: We merged data from 131 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) with georeferenced data on mining projects in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to determine associations between housing quality, indoor air pollution sources, and child respiratory health. Spatial differences in selected indicators were explored using descriptive cross-sectional analyses. Furthermore, we applied a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences (DiD) approach using generalized linear mixed-effects models to compare temporal changes in household and child health indicators at different operational phases of mining projects and as a function of distance to mines. Results: For cross-sectional analyses, data of 183,466 households and 141,384 children from 27 countries in SSA were used, while 41,648 households and 34,406 children from 23 SSA countries were included in the DiD analyses. The increase in the share of houses being built from finished building materials after mine opening was more than 4-fold higher (odds ratio (OR): 4.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.98-6.24) in close proximity to mining sites (i.e., <= 10 km) compared to areas further away (i.e., 10-50 km). However, these benefits were not equally distributed across socioeconomic strata, with considerably weaker effects observed among poorer households. Increases in indoor tobacco smoking rates in close proximity to operating mines were twice as high as in comparison areas (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.15-3.68). The cross-sectional analyses revealed that traditional cooking fuels (e.g., charcoal, dung, and wood) were less frequently used (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.23-0.31) in areas located in close proximity to mines than in comparison areas. Overall, no statistically significant association between mining operations and the prevalence of symptoms related to ARI in children under the age of 5 years was observed (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.29-2.07). Conclusions: Mines impact known risk factors for ARI through diverse pathways. The absence of significant changes in ARI symptoms among children is likely the result of counteracting effects between improvements in housing infrastructure and increased exposures to air pollutants from outdoor sources and tobacco smoking. For mining projects to unfold their full potential for community development, we recommend that impact assessments move beyond the mere appraisal of mining-related pollution emissions and try to include a more comprehensive set of pathways through which mines can affect ARI in exposed communities.

AB  - Plowing and subsequent abandonment of semiarid grasslands in the shortgrass steppe region of North America results in both short- and long-term changes in plant community structure. The traditional Clementsian model of succession in which shortgrasses rapidly dominate the vegetation was modified for these grasslands in the 1970s so that it predicted a prolonged stage characterized by the dominance of the bunchgrass Aristida purpurea, followed by a very slow recovery of shortgrasses after large-scale disturbances. Because neither the Clementsian nor the modified model was supported by results of recent scale-dependent field experiments and simulation analyses, we designed a study to evaluate recovery of shortgrass communities on old fields abandoned for 53 yr in northeastern Colorado, USA. Our objectives were: (1) to compare species composition on abandoned fields with that of adjacent, unplowed areas, (2) to compare vegetation on these fields with predictions from the prevailing conceptual models, and (3) to evaluate the relationship between recovery patterns within fields and distance from the source of propagules at the edge of a field.
   We reached different conclusions based upon the choice of indicator of recovery. For most cases (9 of 13 fields), relative shortgrass cover did not fit predictions of either the Clementsian model or the modified model. High shortgrass cover on two of the remaining fields was similar to that expected by the Clementsian model, and low shortgrass cover on the remaining two fields was similar to that expected by the modified model. Two fields with high shortgrass cover were dominated by Buchloe dactyloides, a species less resistant to drought and grazing than is Bouteloua gracilis, the dominant species in undisturbed communities. Uniformity in cover of other perennial graminoids and density of perennial forbs and annuals on and off fields indicated that these groups had recovered on most fields. However, differences in similarity of species composition on and off fields indicated that none of the fields had recovered. High variability in recovery of vegetation among fields with similar annual climatic variables and soil textures may be attributed to differences in initial conditions, management practices through time, fine-scale climate, and/or other site characteristics that were not measured in this study.
   We found the perennial bunchgrass Bouteloua gracilis on all fields sampled, and it dominated basal cover on two fields. Four groups of fields were distinguishable based on the relationship between Bouteloua gracilis cover and distance from the edge with unplowed vegetation: (1) fields with uniformly high cover of Bouteloua gracilis; (2) fields with a decrease in cover with distance, and cover dominated by Bouteloua gracilis; (3) fields with a decrease in cover with distance, and cover dominated by Buchloe dactyloides; and (4) fields with uniformly low cover of Bouteloua gracilis and Buchloe dactyloides, and dominated by other perennial graminoids, indicating that a mid- to late-successional stage had been reached.
   Our results contrast with the conventional view of shortgrass community response to disturbances, and suggest an alternative view of the recovery process that focuses on interactions between individual plants and their environment to explain recovery patterns that vary in time or space. Accounting for this variability in recovery is critical to the management of these systems, especially under conditions of changing climate and land use.

AB  - Ostracod and diatom assemblages, mollusc remains, plus pollen and sediment stratigraphy from three cores taken at sites 40, 80 and 135 m deep in Lake Neuch (a) over cap tel, Switzerland, show distinct changes since deglaciation, Shifts are interpreted in terms both of climatic change and major changes in the catchment input caused by the Aar River entering or bypassing Lake Neuch (a) over cap tel. Three palaeoenvironmental phases are recognized: (1) the Late Glacial, with the inflow of the river before 10,000 yr B.P.; (2) the early to mid-Holocene, with temporary bypassing of the river between 10,000 and 4850 yr B.P.; and (3) the mid- to late Holocene, without river input after approx. 4850 yr B.P. During periods with river input, rhythmites were deposited, Ostracods indicate a well oxygenated hypolimnion, suggesting deep ventilation enhanced by the river inflow. The diatom assemblage indicates eutrophic to mesotrophic conditions and is dominated by generally well preserved periphytic species, The high number of unidentifiable pollen suggests oxidation during transport in the river. During periods without river input, a massive calcareous silt with abundant authigenic calcite was deposited, diatoms indicate a change to mesotrophic and oligotrophic conditions, and decreased sedimentation rates and higher alkalinity enhanced the dissolution of diatoms. Terrestrial and littoral molluscs as well as periphytic diatoms indicate erosion of the shore when the lake level rose or fell with onset or offset of the river inflow, Before 12,600 yr B.P., the patchy vegetation cover led to intensive soil erosion and high sedimentation rates. The lake was still frozen during the winter months. After approx, 12,600 yr B.P. the sediment changed from elastic rhythmites to thinly bedded, non-glacial rhythmites, the vegetation cover became denser, the abundance of ostracods increased, and molluscs started to colonize the profundal zone of the lake. The Younger Dryas (approx. 10,700-10,000 yr B.P.) displays maximum abundance of ostracods, indicating deep ventilation. The transition to the Holocene is characterized by a change in the ostracod assemblage and the river bypassed the lake between approximately 10,000 and 8900 yr B.P. When the river reentered the lake after approximately 8900 yr B.P., a new ostracod species appeared, After two short periods of river bypassing between approximately 7200 and 6950 yr B.P., diatoms indicate a higher trophic level about 6000-5000 yr B.P. associated with higher erosion rates and increased nutrient input due to Neolithic agricultural activities. After approximately 4850 yr B.P, the river bypassed the lake again and the trophic level decreased. In contrast to the early to mid-Holocene periods of decreased oxygen supply, the mid- to late Holocene is characterized by deep ventilation. This is attributed to the northward retreat of the polarfront and enhanced westerlies consequent to decreased insolation after 6000 yr B.P. The change of the river flow pattern correlates with glacier oscillations and may suggest a climatic control. The final cessation of the inflow is attributed to diversion of the river consequent to isostatic uplift and late Neolithic clearance activity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The modern North Pacific plays a critical role in marine biogeochemical cycles, as an oceanic sink of CO2 and by bearing some of the most productive and least oxygenated waters of the World Ocean. The capacity to sequester CO2 is limited by efficient nutrient supply to the mixed layer, particularly from deeper water masses in the Pacific's subarctic and marginal seas. The region is in addition only weakly ventilated by North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), which receives its characteristics from Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water (OSIW). Here, we present reconstructions of intermediate water ventilation and productivity variations in the Okhotsk Sea that cover the last glacial termination between eight and 18 ka, based on a set of high-resolution sediment cores from sites directly downstream of OSIW formation. In a multi-proxy approach, we use total organic carbon (TOC), chlorin, biogenic opal, and CaCO3 concentrations as indicators for biological productivity. C/N ratios and XRF scanning-derived elemental ratios (Si/K and Fe/K), as well as chlorophycean algae counts document changes in Amur freshwater and sediment discharge that condition the OSIW. Stable carbon isotopes of epi- and shallow endobenthic foraminifera, in combination with C-14 analyses of benthic and planktic foraminifera imply decreases in OSIW oxygenation during deglacial warm phases from c. 14.7 to 13 ka (Bolling-Allerod) and c. 11.4 to 9 ka (Preboreal). No concomitant decreases in Okhotsk Sea benthic-planktic ventilation ages are observed, in contrast to nearby, but southerly locations on the Japan continental margin. We attribute Okhotsk Sea mid-depth oxygenation decreases in times of enhanced organic matter supply to maxima in remineralization within OSIW, in line with multi-proxy evidence for maxima in primary productivity and supply of organic matter. Sedimentary C/N and Fe/K ratios indicate more effective entrainment of nutrients into OSIW and thus an increased nutrient load of OSIW during deglacial warm periods. Correlation of palynological and sedimentological evidence from our sites with hinterland reference records suggests that millennial-scale changes in OSIW oxygen and nutrient concentrations were largely influenced by fluvial freshwater runoff maxima from the Amur, caused by a deglacial northeastward propagation of the East Asian Summer Monsoon that increased precipitation and temperatures, in conjunction with melting of permafrost in the Amur catchment area. We suggest that OSIW ventilation minima and the high lateral supply of nutrients and organic matter during the Allerod and Preboreal are mechanistically linked to concurrent maxima in nutrient utilization and biological productivity in the subpolar Northwest Pacific. In this scenario, increased export of nutrients from the Okhotsk Sea during deglacial warm phases supported subarctic Pacific shifts from generally Fe-limiting conditions to transient nutrient-replete regimes through enhanced advection of mid-depth nutrient-and Fe-rich OSIW into the upper ocean. This mechanism may have moderated the role of the subarctic Pacific in the deglacial CO2 rise on millennial timescales by combining the upwelling of old carbon-rich waters with a transient delivery of mid-depth-derived bio-available Fe and silicate.

AB  - A 5 yr whole-system study, beginning in June 1994, compared the productivity of high [HGM; Australian Breeding Value (ABV) of 49.1 kg of fat plus protein] and low [LGM; ABV of 2.3 kg of fat plus protein] genetic merit cows. Cows from both groups were fed at 3 levels of concentrate (C): 0.34 (low C), 0.84 (medium C), and 1.71 (high C) t of DM/cow per lactation. Thus, there were 6 treatments (farmlets) composed of 18 cows each. The 30 blocks of pasture on each farmlet were matched between farmlets for pasture growth before the study (and soil characteristics and aspect). Cows were culled, and pasture and feed use were managed so as not to bias any one treatment. Genetic merit, level of feeding, and their interaction were significant effects for protein content, protein/cow, and milk and protein/ha. For fat and milk yield/cow, genetic merit and level of feeding were significant, whereas there was no significant effect of genetic merit on fat content. The difference of 46.8 kg of fat plus protein yield between the ABV of HGM and LGM cows and the actual difference in production between the 2 groups was not significantly different except for low C (27 kg) cows. This was due to a 3-fold lower protein yield difference (6 kg/cow) compared with an ABV difference for protein yield of 17.9 kg/cow. The dramatic effect of treatment on protein is in line with differences in the mean protein content (2.89% for the HGM - low C cows compared with a mean of 3.02% for the remaining groups) and mean body condition score [4.3 for HGM - low C cows compared with 4.8 for the mean of the remaining groups (scale 1 to 8)], both indicators reflecting a higher negative energy balance in the HGM - low C cows. When individual cow production was plotted against ABV for production of milk or protein yield all relationships were quadratic, but the slope was relatively flat (low response to ABV) for the low C cows, steeper for the medium C cows and steepest (but not linear) for the high C cows. The relationship between ABV for fat yield and actual fat yield was linear for all levels of concentrate. The mean milk yield/ha from pasture for the 6 farmlets over the 5 yr was 11,868 L, 11,417 L, or 7,761 L for the HGM cows fed at low C, medium C, or high C, respectively, and 10,579 L, 9,800 L, or 5,812 L for LGM cows, fed at low C, medium C, or high C, respectively. The response to concentrates fed was very high for the HGM - medium C cows at 0.115 kg fat plus protein or 1.75 L milk/kg of concentrate fed, with comparable figures of 0.083 kg and 1.0 L, 0.86 kg and 1.47 L and 0.066 and 0.92 L/kg of concentrate fed for the HGM - high C, LGM - medium C, and LGM - high C, respectively. The results show a significant genetic merit by environment (level of feeding) interaction for reproduction and most production parameters when considered in terms of the individual cow and the whole farm system.

AB  - Introduction Exposure to poor environmental conditions has been associated with deterioration of physical and mental health, and with reduction of cognitive performance. Environmental conditions may also influence cognitive development of children, but epidemiological evidence is scant. In developed countries, children spend 930 hours per year in a classroom, second only to time spent in their bedroom. Using continuous sensing technology, we investigate the relationship between indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and cognitive performance of school-aged children. The proposed study will result in a better understanding of the effects of environmental characteristics on cognitive performance, thereby paving the way for experimental studies.
   Methods and analysis A study protocol is presented to reliably measure IEQ in schools. We will monitor the IEQ of 280 classrooms for 5 years, covering approximately 10 000 children. Each classroom in the sample is permanently equipped with a sensor measuring air quality (carbon dioxide and coarse particles), temperature, relative humidity, light intensity and noise levels, all at 1 min intervals. The location of sensing equipment within and across rooms has been validated by a pilot study. Academic performance of school-aged children is measured through standardised cognitive tests. In addition, a series of health indicators is collected (eg, school absence and demand for healthcare), together with an extensive set of sociodemographic characteristics (eg, parental income, education, occupational status).
   Ethics and dissemination Medical Ethical Approval for the current study was waived by the Medical Ethical Committee azM/UM (METC 2018-0681). In addition, data on student performance and health stems from an already existing data infrastructure that are granted with ethical approval by the Ethical Review Committee Inner City faculties (ERCIC_092_12_07_2018). Health data are obtained from the 'The Healthy Primary School of the Future' (HPSF) project. Medical Ethical Approval for HPSF was waived by the Medical Ethical Committee of Zuyderland, Heerlen (METC 14 N-142). The HPSF study protocol was registered in the database ClinicalTrials.gov on 14-06-2016 with reference number NCT02800616, this study is currently in the Results stage. Data collection from Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst Zuid-Limburg (GGD-ZL) is executed by researchers of HPSF, this procedure has been fully approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Zuyderland. The questionnaires on level of comfort will be filled in anonymously by students and teachers. The study will follow the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and Dutch data protection law to ensure protection of personal data, as well as maintain proper data management and anonymisation.
   The protocol discussed in this paper includes significant efforts focused on integrating results and making them available to both the scientific community and the wider public, including policy makers. The results will lead to multiple scientific articles that will be disseminated through peer-reviewed international journals, as well as through conference presentations. In addition, we will exploit ongoing collaboration with project stakeholders and project partners to disseminate information to the target audience. For example, the results will be presented to school boards in the Netherlands, through engagement with the Coalition for Green Schools, as well as to school boards in USA, through engagement with the Center for Green Schools.

AB  - A systematic investigation on silica contents and silicon isotope compositions of bamboos was undertaken. Seven bamboo plants and related soils were collected from seven locations in China. The roots, stem, branch and leaves for each plant were sampled and their silica contents and silicon isotope compositions were determined. The silica contents and silicon isotope compositions of bulk and water-soluble fraction of soils were also measured. The silica contents of studied bamboo organs vary from 0.30% to 9.95%. Within bamboo plant the silica contents show an increasing trend from stem, through branch, to leaves. In bamboo roots the silica is exclusively in the endodermis cells, but in stein, branch and leaves, the silica is accumulated mainly in epidermal cells. The silicon isotope compositions of bamboos exhibit significant variation, from -2.3 parts per thousand to 1.8 parts per thousand, and large and systematic silicon isotope fractionation was observed within each bamboo. The 63 Si values decrease from roots to stem, but then increase from stem, through branch, to leaves. The ranges of 63 Si values within each bamboo vary from 1.0 parts per thousand, to 3.3 parts per thousand. Considering the total range of silicon isotope composition in terrestrial samples is only 7 parts per thousand, the observed silicon isotope variation in single bamboo is significant and remarkable. This kind of silicon isotope variation might be caused by isotope fractionation in a Rayleigh process when SiO2 precipitated in stem, branches and leaves gradually from plant fluid. In this process the Si isotope fractionation factor between dissolved Si and precipitated Si in bamboo (alpha(pre-sol)) is estimated to be 0.9981. However, other factors should be considered to explain the decrease of 63 Si value from roots to stem, including larger ratio of dissolved H4SiO4 to precipitated SiO2 in roots than in stem. There is a positive correlation between the 63 Si values of water-soluble fractions in soils and those of bulk bamboos, indicating that the dissolved silicon in pore water and phytoliths in soil is the direct sources of silicon taken up by bamboo roots. A biochemical silicon isotope fractionation exists in process of silicon uptake by bamboo roots. Its silicon isotope fractionation factor (alpha(bam-wa)) is estimated to be 0.9988. Considering the distribution patterns of SiO2 contents and 63 Si values among different bamboo organs, evapotranspiration may be the driving force for an upward flow of a silicon-bearing fluid and silica precipitation. Passive silicon uptake and transportation may be important for bamboo, although the role of active uptake of silicic acid by roots may not be neglected. The samples with relatively high 63 Si values all grew in soils showing high content of organic materials. In contrast, the samples with relatively low 63 Si values all grew in soil showing low content of organic materials. The silicon isotope composition of bamboo may reflect the local soil type and growth conditions. Our study suggests that bamboos may play an important role in global silicon cycle.

AB  - Recent investigations have considered whether it is possible to achieve early detection of greenhouse-gas-induced climate change by observing changes in ocean variables. In this study we use model data to assess some of the uncertainties involved in estimating when we could expect to detect ocean greenhouse warming signals. We distinguish between detection periods and detection times. As defined here, detection period is the length of a climate time series required in order to detect, at some prescribed significance level, a given linear trend in the presence of the natural climate variability. Detection period is defined in model years and is independent of reference time and the real time evolution of the signal. Detection time is computed for an actual time-evolving signal from a greenhouse warming experiment and depends on the experiment's start date. Two sources of uncertainty are considered: those associated with the level of natural variability or noise, and those associated with the time-evolving signals. We analyze the ocean signal and noise for spatially averaged ocean circulation indices such as heat and fresh water fluxes, rate of deep water formation, salinity, temperature, transport of mass, and ice volume. The signals for these quantities are taken from recent time-dependent greenhouse warming experiments performed by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg with a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. The time-dependent greenhouse gas increase in these experiments was specified in accordance with scenario A of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The natural variability noise is derived from a 300-year control run performed with the same coupled atmosphere-ocean model and from two long (>3000 years) stochastic forcing experiments in which an uncoupled ocean model was forced by white noise surface flux variations. In the first experiment the stochastic forcing was restricted to the fresh water fluxes, while in the second experiment the ocean model was additionally forced by variations in wind stress and heat fluxes. The mean states and ocean variability are very different in the three natural variability integrations. A suite of greenhouse warming simulations with identical forcing but different initial conditions reveals that the signal estimated from these experiments may evolve in noticeably different ways for some ocean variables. The combined signal and noise uncertainties translate into large uncertainties in estimates of detection time. Nevertheless, we find that ocean variables that are highly sensitive indicators of surface conditions, such as convective overturning in the North Atlantic, have shorter signal detection times (35-65 years)than deep-ocean indicators (greater than or equal to 100 years). We investigate also whether the use of a multivariate detection vector increases the probability of early detection. We find that this can yield detection times of 35-60 years (relative to a 1985 reference date) if signal and noise are projected onto a common ''fingerprint'' which describes the expected signal direction. Optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio by (spatial) rotation of the fingerprint in the direction of low-noise components of the stochastic forcing experiments noticeably reduces the detection time (to 10-45 years). However, rotation in space alone does not guarantee an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio for a time-dependent signal. This requires an ''optimal fingerprint'' strategy in which the detection pattern (fingerprint) is rotated in both space and time.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The transport and general handling of slaughter animals are associated with a series of events that cause stressful and unfavorable conditions that can compromise animal welfare. All these stressful events start at the farm and end with the death of the animal. In this experiment, we evaluated the effect of two finishing strategies and two contrasting lairage times through the combination of several indicators regarding productivity, physiology, behavior and postmortem variables. Individual temperaments and their impact on welfare and carcass quality were also considered. Animal welfare was not compromised in any diet during the finishing period. Individual temperament had a positive impact on the productivity and on all physiological indicators at different preslaughter stages. For that reason, we consider that it should be given paramount importance when talking about animal welfare. According to our results, with pasture-based animals, without fasting on the farm and after a short time of transportation (3.5 h), a longer preslaughter resting time (15 vs. 3 h) is desirable from the animal welfare perspective. Furthermore, our results suggest that this longer resting period, would also be more convenient from the carcass quality perspective.
   The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of two different pasture-based finishing strategies and lairage time on steers welfare in Uruguayan conditions. Sixty Hereford (H) and Braford (B) steers were assigned to two different diets for finishing purposes: (D1) native pasture plus corn grain (1% of live weight) (H n = 15, B n = 15) and (D2) high-quality pasture (H n = 15, B n = 15). The average daily gain was registered every 14 days, and temperaments were individually assessed one week before slaughter by three individual tests: crush score, flight time and exit speed, building a multicriterial temperament index (TIndex). Animals were slaughtered the same day in two groups (50% from D1 and 50% from D2 in each group) after traveling for 3.5 h and staying 15 (long lairage) and 3 h (short lairage) in the lairage pens, respectively. The behaviors were observed during lairage, and physiological indicators were used to assess stress at the farm after transport, after lairage and at slaughter. Bruises incidence and final pH were registered at the abattoir as a means of assessing the overall animal welfare. Calmer animals had higher average daily gains with no differences either between diets or between breeds. Calmer animals also had a lower stress response during all preslaughter stages, regardless of the time in lairage. Transport did not imply psychological stress (cortisol) for any slaughter group, but physical stress was evident after transport in both groups through NEFA and CPK increases. Bruise incidences did not differ between lairage groups. The short lairage group did not have enough time to cope with the environment before slaughter, with the consequent deleterious effects on the carcass pH. Animals from the long lairage group had a higher metabolic response shown through NEFA values, but they had enough time to rest and recover overnight, reaching final pH values lower than 5.8, considered the upper limit of the normal range. According to this experiment, with pasture-based animals without fasting on the farm and after 3.5 h of transportation, a resting period of 15 h in lairage should be better than a 3-h one.

AB  - In carcinogenicity experiments with animals where the tumor is not palpable it is common to observe only the time of death of the animal, the cause of death (the tumor or another independent cause, as sacrifice) and whether the tumor was present at the time of death. These last two indicator variables are evaluated after an autopsy. Defining the non-negative variables T-1 (time of tumor onset), T-2 (time of death from the tumor) and C (time of death from an unrelated cause), we observe (Y, Delta(1), Delta(2)), where Y = min{T-2, C}, Delta(1) = 1{T-1 <= C}, and Delta(2) = 1{T-2 <= C}. The random variables T-1 and T-2 are independent of C and have a joint distribution such that P(T-1 <= T-2) = 1. Some authors call this model a "survival-sacrifice model".
   [20] (generally to be denoted by LJP (1997)) proposed a Weighted Least Squares estimator for F-1 (the marginal distribution function of T-1), using the Kaplan-Meier estimator of F-2 (the marginal distribution function of T2). The authors claimed that their estimator is more efficient than the MLE (maximum likelihood estimator) of F1 and that the Kaplan-Meier estimator is more efficient than the MLE of F2. However, we show that the MLE of F-1 was not computed correctly, and that the (claimed) MLE estimate of F-1 is even undefined in the case of active constraints.
   In our simulation study we used a primal-dual interior point algorithm to obtain the true MLE of F-1. The results showed a better performance of the MLE of F-1 over the weighted least squares estimator in LJP (1997) for points where F-1 is close to F-2. Moreover, application to the model, used in the simulation study of LJP (1997), showed smaller variances of the MLE estimators of the first and second moments for both F-1 and F-2, and sample sizes from 100 up to 5000, in comparison to the estimates, based on the weighted least squares estimator for F-1, proposed in LJP (1997), and the Kaplan-Meier estimator for F-2. R scripts are provided for computing the estimates either with the primal-dual interior point method or by the EM algorithm.
   In spite of the long history of the model in the biometrics literature (since about 1982), basic properties of the real maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) were still unknown. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the MLE (Theorem 3.1), as an element of a cone, where the number of generators of the cone increases quadratically with sample size. From this and a self-consistency equation, turned into a Volterra integral equation, we derive the consistency of the MLE (Theorem 4.1). We conjecture that (under some natural conditions) one can extend the methods, used to prove consistency, to proving that the MLE is root n consistent for F-2 and cube root n convergent for F-1, but this has presently not yet been proved.

AB  - A comprehensive biostratinomic study was carried out with abundant stems from the Lower Permian Motuca Formation of the intracratonic Parnaiba Basin, central-north Brazil. The fossils represent a rare tropical to subtropical paleofloristic record in north Gondwana. Tree ferns dominate the assemblages (mainly Tietea, secondarily Psaronius), followed by gymnosperms, sphenophytes, other ferns and rare lycophytes. They are silica-permineralized, commonly reach 4 m length (exceptionally more than 10 m), lie loosely on the ground or are embedded in the original sandstone or siltstone matrix, and attract particular attention because of their frequent parallel attitudes. Many tree fern stems present the original straight cylindrical to slightly conical forms, other are somewhat flattened, and the gymnosperm stems are usually more irregular. Measurements of stem orientations and dimensions were made in three sites approximately aligned in a W E direction in a distance of 27.3 km at the conservation unit "Tocantins Fossil Trees Natural Monument". In the eastern site, rose diagrams for 54 stems indicate a relatively narrow azimuthal range to SE. These stems commonly present attached basal bulbous root mantles and thin cylindrical sandstone envelopes, which sometimes hold, almost adjacent to the lateral stem surface, permineralized fern pinnae and other small plant fragments. In the more central site, 82 measured stems are preferentially oriented in the SW NE direction, the proportion of gymnosperms is higher and cross-stratification sets of sandstones indicate paleocurrents mainly to NE and secondarily to SE. In the western site, most of the 42 measured stems lie in E W positions. The predominantly sandy succession, where the fossil stems are best represented, evidences a braided fluvial system under semiarid conditions. The low plant diversity, some xeromorphic features and the supposedly almost syndepositional silica impregnation of the plants are coherent with marked dry seasons. Thick mudstones and some coquinites below and above the sandy interval may represent lacustrine fades formed in probably more humid conditions. The taphonomic history of the preserved plants began with exceptional storms that caused fast-flowing high water in channels and far into the floodplains. In the eastern site region, many tree ferns only fell, thus sometimes covering and protecting plant litter and leaves from further fragmentation. Assemblages of the central and western sites suggest that the trees were uprooted and transported in suspension (floating) parallel to the flow. Heavier ends of stems (according to their form or because of attached basal bulbous root mantle or large apical fronds) were oriented to upstream because of inertial forces. During falling water stage, the stems were stranded on riverbanks, usually maintaining the previous transport orientation, and were slightly buried. The perpendicular or oblique positions of some stems may have been caused by interference with other stems or shallow bars. Rare observed stems were apparently waterlogged before the final depositional process and transported as bedload. The differences of interpreted channel orientations between the three sites are expected in a braided fluvial system, considering the very low gradients of the basin and the work scale in the order of tens of kilometers. The mean direction of the drainage probably was to east and the flows apparently became weaker downstream.
   This study seems to provide reliable data for paleocurrent interpretations, especially considering areas with scarce preserved sedimentary structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the distribution and modes of occurrence of the main (Au and Ag) and major associated elements indicating mineralization (Hg, Sb, As, Pb, Zn, and Cu) in samples of loose sediments from lithochemical sediment streams of Au-Ag zones at the Dukat deposit. The major mineral and nonmineral modes of occurrence of elements indicating Au-Ag mineralization have been detected with POLAM-312 and POLAR-3 ore microscopes and by X-ray electron probe microanalysis with JCXA-733 and JXA-8200 (JEOL, Japan) microprobes. The distribution and modes of occurrence of ore elements in the loose (alluvial) sediments of streams draining the Au-Ag zones are closely related to the ore composition. As in the ores, the main elements indicating mineralization are Au and Ag, while the major associated elements are Hg, Sb, As, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Gold in alluvial sediments occurs as electrum, fine (dispersed, ultradispersed, and colloid-dispersed) particles, and the so-called "bound" (predominantly with sulfides) invisible Au (sorption component and its derivates). Silver occurs not only as hypergene forms, microinclusions, and ultrasized particles but also in native form and as partly preserved sulfides and sulfosalts. The other elements (Hg, Sb, As, Pb, Zn, and Cu) are observed as secondary minerals of complex composition and differently preserved corroded fragments of pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite grains, dominated by oxides and hydroxides (mainly those of iron). Salts and water-soluble sulfates of Fe, Cu, Pb, and Zn are less widespread. In study of the conditions of sediment stream formation in cryolithogenesis zones, where physical weathering is regarded as the major process, chemical factors (first of all, chemisorption) should also be taken into account. This is proven by the enrichment of "fine" loose material in Au, Ag, and ore elements in general. The high percentage of mobile forms of elements, which are easily leached out by ordinary acids, in ores and aureoles, together with the widespread occurrence of clay minerals and hydroxides, has a significant influence on chemisorption. For example, the portion of fine and "bound" Au, the element considered to be the least prone to chemical weathering, reaches 50-60% in the riverbed sediments of the stream head. Native Au (electrum) makes up 40-50%. The material is diluted during its transport. As Au content decreases, the portion of fine and "bound" Au in the sediment stream increases to 95%. Evidently, these two Au forms are predominant in streams as compared with ores. The modes of occurrence of elements indicating Au-Ag mineralization in secondary environments, as in primary ones, serve as an effective criterion for assessment of the potential of geochemical anomalies detected in sediment streams. They are a reliable indicator of ore associations, which is of practical significance. We think that modes of occurrence can sometimes be used to estimate the erosion level of drained zones and sites (i.e., to predict mineralization to depth). This criterion can be successfully applied at all stages of geochemical study of ore-bearing areas, from the prediction of the potential of anomalies detected in sediment streams in poorly studied areas to the detailed exploration of known ore objects.

AB  - The analysis of epiphytic bryophyte communities taxa of the tropical lowland and montane rain forests of Mt. Kinabalu (Sabah, Northern Borneo, BRYOTROP II - transect) on the basis of a complex of characters fundamental to the ''life-strategy'' concept reveals nine dominant life strategies: Colonists with sexual reproduction, Colonists with vegetative reproduction, Colonists with vegetative and sexual reproduction, Perennial shuttle species with sexual reproduction, Perennial shuttle species with vegetative reproduction, Perennial shuttle species with passive reproduction and Perennial species with vegetative and sexual reproduction, Perennial stayers with sexual reproduction and Perennial stayers with passive reproduction. Each life strategy is defined by a complex of characters presented synoptically in Tab. 1.
   Determination of the mean percentage cover values for the respective life strategies was the basis for the life strategy pattern analysis along an altitudinal gradient along this transect. This enabled us to weight the proportion of each life strategy within the entire spectrum more strongly and to indicate the distribution and occurrence of the respective strategies within the communities and vegetation zones.
   Two life strategies, the Perennial stayers with passive reproduction and the Perennial shuttle species with vegetative reproduction are of an extremely high ecological value and importance in the epiphytic bryophyte communities of Mt. Kinabalu. Obviously, they are characteristic of the epiphytic bryophytic vegetation of tropical forests and they replace each other as climatic conditions change along the altitudinal gradient in the tropics.
   The Perennial stayers with passive reproduction reach a maximum in the Dipterocarpaceae lowland forest, which is more affected by irregularly occurring ''dry periods'', whereas the montane and cloud forests are characterized by taxa with the strategy of the Perennial shuttle species with vegetative reproduction. Mechanisms and characters of this strategy can be qualified as the decisive adaptation of the ever-humid, relatively cool conditions of the montane and cloud forests.
   In the tropical-subalpine region the strategies of the Perennial stayers with passive reproduction, of the Perennial shuttle species with vegetative reproduction, of the Perennial shuttle species with passive reproduction and of the Perennial shuttle species with vegetative and sexual reproduction are equally represented. The latter two strategies reach a maximum here. The Perennial stayers with sexual reproduction are of great importance in clearings and along brooks (open sites), in lowland forests (50 m) and in the lower montane forest (1500 m). This is due to the dominant occurrence of Acanthorrhynchium papillatum, Mastopoma brevifolium and Pyrrhobryum spiniforme. Along the entire altitudinal transect Colonists play a subordinate role and are an indicator of disturbed vegetation in epiphytic bryophyte communities.
   Life strategy analysis of phytosociologically described epiphytic communities corresponds largely to the altitudinal gradient analysis. The Lepidolejeunion bidentulae communities are characterized by the strategy of the Perennial stayers with passive reproduction. Here, starting at an altitude of 900 m, high ecological values are reached by the strategy of the Perennial shuttle species with vegetative reproduction, representing the characteristic life strategy of the Bazzanion tridens and the Bazzanion uncigerae communities (mainly in the upper montane forest). In cloud forest communities there is an additional increase in Perennial shuttle species with vegetative and sexual reproduction as well as in Perennial shuttle species with passive reproduction strategies reaching their greatest importance in the Coeno-Plagiochilion (tropical subalpine region) of the entire altitudinal transect. These Perennial shuttle species with passive reproduction mainly dominate the highest epiphytic community (Sphenolobopsio-Frullanietum junghuhnianae) of Mt. Kinabalu being exposed to great extremes of temperature and fluctuations in humidity.

AB  - UV disinfection technology is of growing interest in the water industry since it was demonstrated that UV radiation is very effective against (oo)cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, two pathogenic micro-organisms of major importance for the safety of drinking water. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment, the new concept for microbial safety of drinking water and wastewater, requires quantitative data of the inactivation or removal of pathogenic micro-organisms by water treatment processes. The objective of this study was to review the literature on UV disinfection and extract quantitative information about the relation between the inactivation of micro-organisms and the applied UV fluence. The quality of the available studies was evaluated and only high-quality studies were incorporated in the analysis of the inactivation kinetics.
   The results show that UV is effective against all waterborne pathogens. The inactivation of micro-organisms by UV could be described with first-order kinetics using fluence-inactivation data from laboratory studies in collimated beam tests. No inactivation at low fluences (offset) and/or no further increase of inactivation at higher fluences (tailing) was observed for some micro-organisms. Where observed, these were included in the description of the inactivation kinetics, even though the cause of tailing is still a matter of debate. The parameters that were used to describe inactivation are the inactivation rate constant k (cm(2)/mJ), the maximum inactivation demonstrated and (only for bacterial spores and Acanthamoeba) the offset value. These parameters were the basis for the calculation of the microbial inactivation credit (MIC = "log-credits") that can be assigned to a certain LTV fluence. The most LTV-resistant organisms are viruses, specifically Adenoviruses, and bacterial spores. The protozoon Acanthamoeba is also highly UV resistant. Bacteria and (oo)cysts of Cryptosporidium and Giardia are more susceptible with a fluence requirement of < 20 mJ/cm(2) for an MIC of 3 log.
   Several studies have reported an increased UV resistance of environmental bacteria and bacterial spores, compared to lab-grown strains. This means that higher UV fluences are required to obtain the same level of inactivation. Hence, for bacteria and spores, a correction factor of 2 and 4 was included in the MIC calculation, respectively, whereas some wastewater studies suggest that a correction of a factor of 7 is needed under these conditions. For phages and viruses this phenomenon appears to be of little significance and for protozoan (oo)cysts this aspect needs further investigation. Correction of the required fluence for DNA repair is considered unnecessary under the conditions of drinking water practice (no photo-repair, dark repair insignificant, esp. at higher (60 mJ/cm(2)) fluences) and probably also wastewater practice (photo-repair limited by light absorption). To enable accurate assessment of the effective fluence in continuous flow UV systems in water treatment practice, biodosimetry is still essential, although the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) improves the description of reactor hydraulics and fluence distribution. For UV systems that are primarily dedicated to inactivate the more sensitive pathogens (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, pathogenic bacteria), additional model organisms are needed to serve as biodosimeter.

AB  - 1. Single Purkinje cells, enzymatically isolated from rabbit ventricle, were studied under whole-cell voltage clamp and internally perfused with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, indo-1 (100 muM).
   2. Fast [Ca2+]i transients were elicited by brief depolarizations from a holding voltage of -45 mV and by repolarization from very positive potentials. The peak [Ca2+]i-voltage relation was bell-shaped with a peak around +10 mV.
   3. [Ca2+]i transients were completely blocked by the Ca2+ channel antagonist, nisoldipine (10 muM) and were very small when Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was prevented by superfusion of cells by caffeine (1 mm) or ryanodine (10 muM). A fast application of caffeine induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest [Ca2+]i transients are due to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the SR.
   4. Rate of decline of the [Ca2+]i transient was voltage dependent, suggesting contribution of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to Ca2+ efflux. At very positive potentials (> +60 mV), Ca2+ influx through the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger could be observed.
   5. A transient outward current was observed at potentials positive to +10 mV, but only if depolarizing pulses were accompanied by a [Ca2+]i transient.
   6. When the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient was changed by (1) changes in [Ca2+]o, (2) changes in frequency of depolarization or (3) conditioning prepulses, the amplitude of the outward current changed in the same direction. This suggests activation of the current is dependent on and graded by [Ca2+]i.
   7. The outward current was observed in K+-free solutions, in the presence of Cs+ and TEA+, and was not blocked by 4-aminopyridine (10 mm). In contrast, DIDS (100 muM) decreased the outward current by 70 +/- 20 % (mean +/- S. D., n = 9), without affecting [Ca2+]i.
   8. When external Cl- was lowered, the amplitude of the outward current decreased; when internal Cl- was replaced by aspartate, it became apparent at more negative potentials. These interventions strongly suggest the current was carried by Cl-; it can therefore be referred to as a [Ca2+]i-activated Cl-current or I(Cl(Ca)).
   9. When I(Cl(Ca)) was maximally activated during a conditioning step, steps to negative potentials revealed inward currents through I(Cl(Ca)) (in symmetrical Cl- solutions). The fully activated I-V relation was linear.
   10. I(Cl(Ca)) could be activated at membrane potentials between -80 and +80 mV by a fast application of caffeine (10 mm), inducing Ca2+ release from the SR, demonstrating that I(Cl(Ca)) does not require membrane depolarization or Ca2+ influx through the Ca2+ channel for its activation. However, at negative potentials the amplitude of I(Cl(Ca)) decreased.
   11. The time course of I(Cl(Ca)) did not follow the time course of the [Ca2+]i transient. I(Cl(Ca)) declined early, before [Ca2+]i reached its peak. Study of inward tail currents, and of I(Cl(Ca)) activated by caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i transients, confirmed early decline.
   12. These observations cannot be reconciled with a simple ligand-operated channel. The transient nature of I(Cl(Ca)) might be due to an inactivation process, or, alternatively, the differences in time course between I(Cl(Ca)) and [Ca2+]i could reflect the existence of important gradients for Ca2+ between the cytoplasm and the subsarcolemmal space.

AB  - Growth, molting, and development of larval Antarctic krill were investigated near Marguerite Bay during four cruises in austral autumn and winter 2001 and 2002, as part of the US Southern Ocean GLOBEC program. Overwintering survival of larvae has been linked to annual sea-ice formation and extent, as sea-ice biota may provide food when other sources are scarce in the water column. During autumn 2001, larvae were very abundant (1-19 individuals m(-3)), with younger stages dominant offshelf and older stages dominant on-shelf. On-shelf larvae were in better condition than offshore larvae. During autumn 2002, larvae again were abundant offshelf (0.01-110 m(-3)), whereas all stages were scarce on-shelf. Declining diatom and radiolarian blooms were present during autumn in both years. Average chlorophyll concentrations were low (0.10 vs. 0.22 mug 1(-1)) in autumn and an order of magnitude lower in winter. Carbon content of larvae during autumn 2001 and 2002 (41% vs. 38% C of DW) suggested that lipid storage was moderate. The median autumn larval growth rate (0.027 mm d(-1)) was lower and the intermolt period (19 d) longer than reported summer values. During winter, larvae appeared to be food-limited based on the following observations: (1) the median growth rate decreased (0.00 mm d(-1)) and the intermolt period increased (40 d), (2) larval length-specific dry weight (DW) and % carbon and nitrogen of DW decreased, and (3) 88 % of furcilia 6 did not develop to the juvenile stage, but remained at the same stage after molting. Experimental results demonstrated that some larvae could survive starvation for a month by combusting body reserves (ca. 1 % decrease in DW and body C and Nd-1), implying that a portion of the population was resilient to the suboptimal food supply. Although sea ice formed up to 2 months earlier in 2002, ice algae at the ice-water interface, where it is accessible to krill, was not an abundant food source in either year (0.05 vs. 0.07 mug chl 1(-1)). In winter 2001, furcilia were commonly observed near the undersurface of sea-ice, but only rarely in 2002 until mid-September, when ice algae began to accumulate. Low gut fluorescence values also indicate that little nutrition was derived from autotrophs in winter. Instead, larvae were likely opportunistic scavengers exploiting all available food sources, including microzooplankton, benthic larvae, detritus, scarce phytoplankton and sea-ice biota. In summary, larval krill exhibited several overwintering behaviors: (1) flexible feeding, (2) flexible morphology (i.e., delayed development), (3) flexible physiology (i.e., increased intermolt period, reduced growth), (4) moderate lipid storage, and (5) ability to withstand starvation by combusting body C and N. Because most larvae did not shrink in length, this measure may not be a good indicator of the body combustion strategy. At these high latitudes, sea-ice biota may not be a primary source of food during winter, but progressively more important in spring as irradiance levels increase. Winter survivors during 2001 resulted in a significant recruitment to the juvenile size class during spring. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Sows are susceptible to heat stress. Various indicators can be found in the literature assessing the level of heat stress in pigs, but none of them is specific to assess the sows' thermal condition. Moreover, previous thermal indices have been developed by considering only partial environment parameters, and the interaction between the index and the animal's physiological response are not always included. Therefore, this study aims to develop and assess a new thermal index specified for sows, called equivalent temperature index for sows (ETIS), with a comprehensive consideration of the influencing factors. An experiment was conducted, and the experimental data was applied for model development and validation. The equivalent temperatures have been transformed on the basis of equal effects of air velocity, relative humidity, floor heat conduction and indoor radiation on the thermal index, and used for the ETIS combination. The correlations between ETIS and sow's physiological parameters were performed. In the comparison with other thermal indices, the ETIS had the best performance (R = 0.82) using experimental data obtained from the sow house. In addition, the comfort threshold of ETIS has been classified for evaluating heat stress levels in the sow. This study concludes that the newly developed ETIS can be used to assess the degree of thermal comfort for sows.
   Heat stress affects the estrus time and conception rate of sows. Compared with other life stages of pigs, sows are more susceptible to heat stress because of their increased heat production. Various indicators can be found in the literature assessing the level of heat stress in pigs. However, none of them is specific to assess the sows' thermal condition. Moreover, thermal indices are mainly developed by considering partial environment parameters, and there is no interaction between the index and the animal's physiological response. Therefore, this study aims to develop a thermal index specified for sows, called equivalent temperature index for sows (ETIS), which includes parameters of air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. Based on the heat transfer characteristics of sows, multiple regression analysis is used to combine air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. Environmental data are used as independent variables, and physiological parameters are used as dependent variables. In 1029 sets of data, 70% of the data is used as the training set, and 30% of the data is used as the test set to create and develop a new thermal index. According to the correlation equation between ETIS and temperature-humidity index (THI), combined with the threshold of THI, ETIS was divided into thresholds. The results show that the ETIS heat stress threshold is classified as follows: suitable temperature ETIS < 33.1 degrees C, mild temperature 33.1 degrees C <= ETIS < 34.5 degrees C, moderate stress temperature 34.5 degrees C <= ETIS < 35.9 degrees C, and severe temperature ETIS >= 35.9 degrees C. The ETIS model can predict the sows' physiological response in a good manner. The correlation coefficients R of skin temperature was 0.82. Compared to early developed thermal indices, ETIS has the best predictive effect on skin temperature. This index could be a useful tool for assessing the thermal environment to ensure thermal comfort for sows.

AB  - Introduction. In the modern period, the increase in the resource base is largely associated with the exploration of deposits that are under development. The latter process includes the study of non-traditional reservoirs, among which of considerable interest are compacted sand-silt rocks.
   Steady growth in raw material consumption has led to the search for alternative sources of hydrocarbons. The development of the industry is aimed at studying existing deposits with the introduction and involvement of the latest, advanced technologies. In this regard, the development of this area is relevant. Undoubtedly, the search for hydrocarbons in compacted sand-silt rocks within the Dnieper-Donetsk basin will develop.
   Purpose. To propose the main geological criteria for detecting hydrocarbon saturation of compacted rocks, which are accompanied by certain indicators.
   Analysis of previous works. Until recently, information on compacted hydrocarbon-unsaturated sandsilt rocks was most often found only in foreign publications. In the 60's of the XX century, employees of UkrNDIgaz tried to study in detail the compacted hydrocarbon-saturated rocks, but at that time this area was not developed. These studies are associated with the names of Mukharinskaya I, Kharchenko S, Lagutina A. In recent decades, issues regarding compacted sand-siltstone rocks in Dnieper-Donetsk basin have been considered during gas-type gas research. Until recently, the detection of gas in compacted rocks was of a general nature and was not substantiated by actual material.
   Presenting main material. The nature of the compacted sand-silt varieties is very diverse. Due to the peculiarities of lithological packs, compacted rocks should be considered both separately and in combination with direct contact with traditional reservoir rocks.
   Scientific and theoretical research and factual material allow us to identify promising stratigraphic complexes in terms of hydrocarbon saturation in compacted sand-silt rocks. Compacted sand-siltstone rocks acquire the greatest development within the Lower Permian-Upper Coal and Middle-Lower Coal complexes.
   The main criteria for detecting compacted rocks should be considered the degree of saturation of rocks and the nature of hydrocarbons. Consider the indicators that characterize these two processes.
   Due to the fact that geological criteria and their indicators (a kind of indicator) often interact, complement each other and are "hostages" of causal processes.
   Conclusions. The proposed criteria are based on a number of geological indicators, such as ascending migration of hydrocarbons, features of lithological composition, conditions of conversion of imported and own organic matter, low water content of the stratum. The activity of most processes, which are indicators of the proposed basic criteria of oil and gas, are accompanied by an increase in the temperature of the local zone of development of compacted sand-silt rocks.
   In one of these zones the connection of temperature anomaly with the main indicators of prospects for oil and gas bearing capacity of compacted sand-silt rocks is considered.
   One of the methods of practical detection of the degree of hydrocarbon saturation in compacted sand-silt rocks, especially in the zone of elevated temperatures, can be a direct method of geological-gas-geochemical research, based on the simultaneous study of geological properties and gas-geochemical features.

AB  - This paper is aimed at a synthesis of conclusions and concepts from the first three papers of this series and an inquiry of their relevance to the estimation of the risk of autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases in man, due to exposure to ionizing radiation.
   For a population under conditions of continuous irradiation, the doubling-dose method (DD method) enables the prediction of the excess risk of dominant and X-linked diseases at equilibrium.  Per unit dose, this quantity is the product of the natural prevalence of these diseases (assumed to be 10,000/10(6) livebirths) and the reciprocal of the DD.  The DD currently used is 1 Gy and is based primarily on data on the induction of recessive specific-locus mutations in male mice.  The estimate of risk to the first generation is derived from that at equilibrium; the figure is about 15% of the equilibrium value (i.e., 15 cases/10(6) livebirths/cGy).
   With the direct method, the first-generation risk of dominant disease is estimated using data on the induction of dominant skeletal and cataract mutations in male mice and a number of correction factors.  The estimates are about 10-20 cases and 0-9 cases, respectively, for irradiation of males and females, per 10(6) livebirths/cGy.
   In the Japanese studies, no significant adverse genetic effects, attributable to exposure of the parents to the atomic bombs, could be demonstrated with respect to any of the endpoints used.  Most of the latter are clinically and socially relevant but mutationally insensitive.  On the basis of these data, Neel and colleagues have estimated that the gametic DD for genetic effects of radiation in man is at least about 4-5 times the 1 Gy value thus far used.
   The concepts, assumptions, and the data-base used with the DD method have been re-examined.  Arguments are advanced to support the thesis that ionizing radiation is probably not very efficient in inducing the very specific molecular changes that are known to underlie spontaneous mutations which cause naturally occurring dominant genetic diseases.  It is suggested that (i) the DD estimate of 1 Gy that is used to estimate risk for autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases is conservative and (ii) the 1% prevalence figure for these diseases that is used for this purpose may be too high.  If these suggestions are correct, then the estimate of risk for the dominant and X-linked diseases may need to be revised downwards.
   The question of the total risk of genetic disease (i.e., an estimate which includes the very large class of multifactorial diseases) is not addressed here and is not answerable at present using the DD method, one important reason being that the mutation-responsive component of these diseases cannot be reliably estimated.  The choice of an overall DD used for genetic risk estimation depends on what indicators are perceived to be relevant in the human context and is largely judgemental.
   Since recessives predominate among radiation-induced mutations, adverse genetic effects of radiation exposure are primarily those associated with induced recessive mutations in the heterozygous condition.  Some suggestions are made for further work to improve genetic risk estimates.

AB  - The reforms of Russian higher education of the last decade are largely aimed to expand the communicative educational space, which ensures the integration of scientific knowledge. Consequently, new technological and social research areas come to the fore. Knowledge integration implies close cooperation with world universities and research centers, which requires universities being the main executors in the training of a modern specialist to be ready to interact in a multilingual academic space. Multilingual environment creation is indicated in many roadmaps of Russian universities as a strategic direction for effective development. However, the process of its creation is still not complete and requires the fulfillment of certain conditions. The educational environment does not imply only educational materials and stands, the presence of centers of academic mobility and international cooperation but also communication and technologies, approaches and tools. The multilingual university environment is an indicator of the level of its internationalization, whose key indicators are as follows: 1) internal and external academic mobility, 2) publication activity, 3) research collaboration. The search for methods and tools contributing to the fulfillment of the assigned tasks determines the relevance of our research, which consists in the choice of educational approaches contributing to internationalization of Russian higher education. The article analyses the university's preparedness to interact in a multilingual educational environment on the example of Tomsk Polytechnic University. We propose following the principle of subject and linguistic knowledge integration as a tool for addressing the above problems. Therefore, an approach known as CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) was chosen as the object of research. The approach has a dual purpose, which stipulates that a foreign language serves as a tool for studying specialized disciplines. The present article aims to analyze the potential of this approach to develop language competence of students and university teachers. By analysis we mean studying and evaluating the didactic potential of the approach based on existing concepts and world practices, as well as the prerequisites for its appearance in Russia. Despite a rather wide spread of the approach and its high popularity rating in the world, at the moment there is no universal model able to "integrate" into any education system not regarding the specifics of cultural, mental and other peculiarities of the country, as well as the features of university management. One of the conditions for the successful approach implementation is the willingness of the teaching staff to work with its didactic tools. However, readiness implies not only the desire and realization of the approach potential but also a certain methodological knowledge enabling to rationally and maximally use the approach to fulfill educational, pedagogical and managerial tasks. Thus, there arises the issue of creating specialized programs or courses designed to prepare higher school teachers to conduct classes based on CLIL and to organize CLIL education in general. The current research outcomes are the results on the teachers' survey used to identify the degree of their satisfaction with CLIL implementation and the prospects for further professional development.
   The survey revealed the main issues of the current situation, which, in turn, provided the basis for developing some measures that would allow to partially and consistently eliminate the difficulties encountered.

AB  - Several reports have indicated that udder surface temperature (UST) can be a useful indicator of subclinical mastitis (SCM). The objective was to evaluate UST by infrared thermography (IRT) as a diagnostic tool for SCM and intrarnarnrnary infection (IMI), and to assess the influence of environmental conditions in the potential diagnosis of this disease in dairy cows located at high-altitude tropical regions. A total of 105 cows (397 quarters) from 3 dairy farms with mechanical and manual milking methods were enrolled in the study. Subclinical mastitis was diagnosed when quarter samples had a somatic cell count (SCC) >= 200 x 10(3)cells/mL, microbial growth (MG) was defined when a major pathogen (>= 1 cfu/plate) or Corynebacterium spp. (>= 10 cfu/plate) was isolated, and IMI was defined as the presence of MG and SCC >= 100 x 10(3) cells/mL. Infrared images were taken with a thermal camera placed 1 m away from the udder, and shots of the rear and left and right lateral view were made during the morning milking, before any manipulation of the udder and employing dark cardboard on the contralateral side to avoid artifacts in the background. A multilevel mixed effects linear regression model clustered within cows and herd was performed to evaluate the associations with UST. Clinical performance was evaluated using the Youden index to establish the optimum UST thresholds, which were set at 32.6 degrees C for any case definition when milking was by hand, at 33.7 degrees C for MG, and at 34 degrees C for SCM and IMI in machine-milked quarters. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), area under curve (AUC), and positive likelihood ratio (+LR) were also assessed. Test agreement was assessed by kappa coefficient (kappa). The UST of healthy quarters ranged between (95% CI) 32.4 and 32.6 degrees C, lower than SCM quarters (n = 88) at 32.9 degrees C (95% CI: 32.7-33.1 degrees C), MG quarters (n = 56) at 33.5 degrees C (95% CI: 33.3-33.7 degrees C), and IMI quarters (n = 50) at 33.5 degrees C (95%CI: 33.2-33.7 degrees C). The UST was also related to the milking method: higher temperatures were observed for hand milking (n = 90) compared with machine milking (n = 185). No relation between environmental conditions such as wind speed, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, and temperature-humidity index and UST were observed during this study. For hand milking, the optimal UST threshold was 32.6 degrees C; for SCM, Se = 0.53, Sp = 0.89, AUC = 0.71, kappa, = 0.4; for MG, Se = 0.83, Sp = 0.93, AUC = 0.88, kappa = 0.77; and for IMI, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.92, AUC = 0.87, kappa = 0.74. The machine milking threshold for SCM resulted in Se = 0.42, Sp = 0.97, AUC = 0.70, kappa = 0.47; for MG, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.89, AUC = 0.85, kappa = 0.60; and for IMI, Se = 0.82, Sp = 0.98, AUC = 0.90, kappa = 0.79. These findings suggest that UST determined by IRT is higher in machine-milked cows and in quarters with MG and IMI than in healthy quarters; therefore, UST by IRT is a reliable, clinically useful method for MG and IMI diagnosis.

AB  - The style and intensity of hydromagmatic activity is governed by a complex interplay between the relative volumes of magma and water that interact, their relative viscosities, the depth of subsurface explosions, the substrate properties, and the vent geometry. Fundamental questions remain, however, regarding the role of magmatic vesiculation in determining the dynamics of magma-water interaction (MWI). Petrological reconstructions of magmatic degassing histories are commonly employed to interpret the pre- and syn-eruptive conditions during 'dry' magmatic eruptions, but the application of similar techniques to hydromagmatic activity has not yet been fully explored. In this study, we integrate glass volatile measurements (S, CI, H2O and CO2) with field observations and microtextural measurements to examine the relationship between degassing and eruptive style during the Hverfjall Fires fissure eruption, Iceland. Here, coeval fissure vents produced both 'dry' magmatic (Jarobaosholar scoria cone complex) and variably wet hydromagmatic (Hverfjall tuff ring) activity, generating physically distinct pyroclastic deposits with contrasting volatile signatures. Matrix glass volatile concentrations in hydromagmatic ash (883 +/- 172 [1 sigma] ppm S; 0.45 +/- 0.03 [1 sigma] wt% H2O;<= 20 ppm CO2) are consistently elevated relative to magmatic ash and scoria lapilli (418 +/- 93 [1 sigma] ppm S; 0.12 +/- 0.48 Pal wt% H2O; CO2 below detection) and overlap with the range for co-erupted phenocryst-hosted melt inclusions (1522 +/- 127 [1 sigma] ppm S; 165 +/- 27 [1 sigma] ppm CI). Measurements of hydromagmatic glasses indicate that the magma has degassed between 17 and 70% of its initial sulfur prior to premature quenching at variably elevated confining pressures. By comparing volatile saturation pressures for both magmatic and hydromagmatic glasses, and how these vary through the eruptive stratigraphy, we place constraints on the conditions of MWI. Crucially, our data demonstrate that the magma was already vesiculating when it encountered groundwater at depths of 100-200 m, and that the external water supply was sufficient to maintain MWI throughout the eruption with no significant vertical or lateral migration of the fragmentation surface. We propose that development of an in-vent water sediment slurry provides a mechanism through which the elevated confining pressures of similar to 1.6-2.6 MPa (or up to 6 MPa accounting for uncertainty in CO2 below analytical detection) could be maintained and buffered throughout the eruption, whilst enabling vertical mixing and ejection of fragmented juvenile and lithic material from a range of depths. Importantly, these results demonstrate that the volatile contents of hydromagmatic deposits provide valuable records of (1) the environment of MWI (e.g., groundwater versus surface water, vertical migration of the fragmentation level) and (2) the state of the magma at the time of fragmentation and quenching. We further suggest that the volatile content of tephra glasses provides a reliable alternative (or additional) indicator of a hydromagmatic origin, particularly for reduced Ocean Island Basalts where late-stage volatile saturation and degassing (S, H2O) occurs over a pressure range relevant to typical MWI environments.

AB  - In recent years, a negative situation has developed as a result of mass invasions of adventive pests on the lands of the forest fund, among which the oak lace bug Corythucha arcuata Say (Heteroptera: Tingidae) requires special attention. The pest poses a great danger to the survival and productivity of oak forests and forest plantations in the South of Russia. The existing methods of pest monitoring do not always reflect the real constants of the phenology of target objects, which leads to errors in determining the optimal timing of protective measures and a decrease in their effectiveness. Hence, research in the development of precision methods for phytosanitary monitoring of harmful species is an important problem of plant protection, especially biological. The study of the phenology and dynamics of the oak lace bug will allow optimizing protective measures, taking into account the most vulnerable phases of phytophage development and the timing of treatments. The aim of this study was to develop precision methods for monitoring the dynamics of the number and age structure of the oak lace bug population based on the use of the heat content of the atmosphere.
   The studies were carried out in the central (Krasnodar), northeastern (Tikhoretsk) and western (Krymsk) zones of Krasnodar Krai belonging to the temperate climatic zone, as well as the Black Sea zone (Sochi), located in the subtropical climatic zone. The choice of localities for the research was carried out taking into account the territories of invasive distribution of the oak lace bug and the differences in climatic conditions from moderate continental to subtropical. The calculation of the heat content (enthalpy) of air was carried out using a modified Ramzin nomogram (See Fig. 1). Phenological observations and counting of the number of C. arcuata bugs were carried out on model trees of English oak (Quercus robur L.) (See Fig. 2). The reference date was chosen empirically based on the use of heat content indicators that are different in terms of reference periods and corresponding to these periods (See Table 1).
   As a result of the studies carried out during 2018-2020, the actual dates of the onset of the phenophases of the oak lace bug and the corresponding enthalpy of air (the heat content) were determined (See Table 2). We calculated the amount of heat required for the emergence of the oak lace bug after winter diapause (140-145 kcal/kg air) and passing through the preimaginal stages of development from egg-laying (158-167 kcal/ kg), hatching of larvae (180-194 kcal/kg) before fledging of adults of a new generation (136-145 kcal/kg). The sum of effective temperatures (SET) was calculated according to the generally accepted method (Chernova, Bylova, 2004; Zamotajlov et al., 2009) (See Table 3). We have shown that the enthalpy of air is the most preferable indicator for assessing thermal characteristics for determining the timing of the appearance of overwintered individuals, the passage of phenophases of insects and the number of their generations in comparison with the sum of effective temperatures (See Table 2 and 3). We found that the number of generations of oak lace bug in the central, western and northeastern zones (temperate climatic zone) of Krasnodar Krai, which is directly dependent on the heat content of the air, was three, and in the Black Sea zone (subtropical climatic zone) there were four generations per seasonal cycle. To improve the reliability of predicting the timing of phenological phases of the oak lace bug, a method for monitoring phenophases of the pest based on calculating the heat content of the air has been developed, which can be used for practical purposes to optimize protective measures associated with the use of insecticides, growth and development regulators of insects, entomopathogens and entomophages in agricultural and forest cenoses.
   Thus, distribution, development rate, number dynamics and harmfulness of the species to the greatest extent depend on the ecological resource of the inhabited territory, determined by the enthalpy of the air. On the basis of enthalpy, the rate of passage of phenophases and the number of generations of the pest, which determine its invasive development in large areas, are reliably calculated.

AB  - Background, Goal and Scope. The palm oil industry is one of the leading industries in Malaysia. With a yearly production of more than 13 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO) and plantations covering 11% of the Malaysian land area it is an industry to be reckoned with, also when it comes to environmental impacts. One way to describe and present the environmental impacts is through a life cycle assessment, LCA. This assessment aims to introduce the concept of LCA and perform a screening LCA on crude palm oil production in Malaysia including the stages of plantation, transport and milling. The assessment is largely based on general data and is thus meant to function as an indication of the environmental threads posed by CPO production and as a guideline to CPO producers and local universities on how to perform an LCA on a palm oil scenario. Due to the general data background the results of this report should not be quoted directly for decision making. The Functional Unit, to which all masses and emissions in this assessment have been adjusted, is the production of 1000 kg of CPO in Malaysia.
   Method. Initially an overview of palm oil production was obtained and the outlines and borders of the assessment were determined along with the specific goal and scope of the assessment. The data for the assessment was collected from three different sources:
   1. Earlier studies and statistics on palm oil production in Malaysia
   2. Studies on similar processes, when palm oil related processes were not available
   3. General data from the SimaPro 5 database
   The European Eco-Indicator 99 method and European databases included in the LCA software SimaPro 5 have been used for the impact calculations.
   Results and Discussion.The impact processes related to the plantation are the on-site energy use (mainly diesel) and the production of artificial fertilizer. Pesticide use contributes a minor impact due to widely used integrated biological poet management. For transportation the only impact is from combustion of diesel and at the mill the boiler is the sole significant contributor positively through electricity production and negatively by emissions from the boiler. Impacts from POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent) are not dealt with in the main assessment, but touched upon in alternative scenarios. The results clearly show that fertilizer production is the most polluting process in the system followed by transportation and the boiler emissions at a tie. The most significant impacts from the system are respiratory inorganics and depletion of fossil fuels, of which the boiler emission is the main responsible for the prior and fertilizer production and transportation are responsible for the latter. It is also evident from the results that crude palm oil production is a significant environmental impact generator in Malaysia due to the vast production quantities. Alternative scenarios revealed that there are significant impact savings to be made by introduction of environmental investments, both regarding the overall impacts and in particularly regarding CO, emissions.
   Conclusion. A screening LCA was successfully conducted on the Malaysian crude palm oil production thus promising potentials for the palm oil industry to conduct their own inventories and assessments using specific company data.
   Crude palm oil production in Malaysia is responsible for app. 3.5% of the total environmental impacts in the country and must thus be given attention to reduce impacts. Alternatives such as optimized use of organic fertilizer, environmentally friendlier artificial fertilizer production, rail transport, approved filters at the mill boiler stack and biogas harvest from POME digestion must thus be promoted in the industry.
   Recommendations. The Malaysian palm oil industry should take steps towards introducing LCA. Exhaustive inventories are likely to open the eyes of many companies towards implementing environmental investments and improve the international competitiveness. In order to retrieve results with a greater accuracy in the future, databases must be created containing life cycle data from Malaysian scenarios and normalization and weighting factors must be designed to reflect Malaysian conditions. The Malaysian authorities must create incentives through increased tariffs on electricity and diesel and/or financial support for cleaner technology investments.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Selenium (Se) is one of the most widely distributed elements of the earth's crust at low concentrations. The extensive use of Se-containing chemicals due to anthropogenic activities has increased the ecological risk to environmental compartments. Plants, under unfavorable environmental conditions, often increase the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and consequently plant antioxidant enzymatic systems have been proposed to be important in plant stress tolerance. The goal of this study was to find out the metabolic responses of plants to Se, to provide quantitative information whether exogenous Se has a beneficial role in plants, and to investigate the potential of vegetation management of Se for potential phytoremediation.
   Material and Methods. Pre-rooted plants of weeping willows (Salix babylonica L.) were grown hydroponically in growth chambers and treated with Na2SeO4 or Na2SeO3 at 24.0 +/- 1 degrees C for 168 h. Five different treatment concentrations were used, ranging from 0.44 to 8.72 mg Se/L for the treatments exposed to SeO42- and from 0.50 to 10.0 mg Se/L for the treatments 4 exposed to SeO32-, respectively. Transpiration rates, soluble pro- rein contents and antioxidative enzyme activities of the plants were monitored to evaluate toxicity from exogenous Se exposure. At the end of the study, total Se in the hydroponic solution was analyzed by hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS).
   Results. Both chemical forms of Se at low concentrations showed growth-promoting effects on plants. A significant decrease of transpiration rates and of soluble protein contents of plants was observed at higher Se concentrations after 168 h of exposure. Measurable change of superoxide dismutases (SOD) activity in leaves was only detected under high Se treatments. Catalase (CAT) activity was significantly affected by the Se application. Slight change of peroxidase (POD) activity was measured in all treatments, whereas significant inhibition of POD activity was detected for the plants exposed to SeO32- of 10.0 mg Se/L. Se-induced stress 3 appeared in all treatments, thus resulting in measurable increase of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity of the plants. Although both chemical forms of Se were taken up by weeping willows efficiently, their uptake rates were different.
   Discussion. Of all measured parameters, POD and CAT activities in leaves were noted the most sensitive indicator for the plants exposed to SeO42- and SeO32- respectively. Deleterious effects on plant physiological functions due to Se application were not observed over 168 h of exposure. This is largely due to the fact that well-established antioxidant enzymatic systems in plants and higher activities of GSH-Px largely reduced the negative effects on plants; SeO32- caused much more severe stress to plants than SeO42- at higher Se application rates. The uptake mechanisms 4 between the two chemical species were quite different.
   Conclusions. Neither visible toxic symptoms nor metabolic lesions were observed at low concentrations of Se, probably due to the effective established enzymatic systems in weeping willows. All selected parameters for toxicity determination were significantly correlated to Se application, but metabolic responses of plants to SeO42- and SeO32- were quite different. GSH-Px in 4 leaves was probably the principle enzyme responsible for stress reduction from Se exposure. Due to their different chemical properties, weeping willows showed a faster uptake rate for SeO42- than for SeO32-.
   Recommendations. Exogenous Se has a beneficial role in plants and vegetation management of Se is a potential remediation strategy in cleaning up Se-contaminated sites. Further investigation on the biochemical mechanism of Se metabolism will provide insight to the specific interactions between Se and plants on the molecular level.
   Perspectives. Weeping willow has a sound potential for phytoremediation of Se-contaminated sediment and groundwater because the tree is not only tolerant to Se but also uptakes chemical species from the environment.

AB  - Under ISO 14040, normalisation is an optional step in life-cycle impact assessment designed to provide environmental context by indicating the relative contribution that the product system under investigation makes in the various impact categories, in comparison to a suitable reference scenario. The challenge for many studies, however, is to provide the appropriate context by adopting a normalisation reference scenario that is well matched to the product system's parent environment. Australia has a highly urbanised population, mainly contained in just eight capital cities. In the context of normalising environmental impacts against the profile of an 'average' Australian, this poses a unique problem, compared to other industrialised regions of the world. This study aims to use publicly available data on environmentally relevant emissions and non-renewable resource consumption in 2005/2006 to develop regional normalisation data for Australia, at both inventory and characterisation levels.
   The regionalised inventory of emissions and resources production is constructed using a framework of 60 regional Statistical Divisions from the Australian Standard Geographical Classification system. Data from the National Pollutant Inventory, Australian Greenhouse Emissions Information System and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (energy and mineral statistics) are used as the basis for the inventories. These data could subsequently be used by any LCA practitioner to construct characterisation or normalisation data by impact category, according to any preferred life-cycle impact assessment methodology, for any of 60 regions in the country. In this study, the regionalised inventory data were assessed using the CML 2001 baseline and IMPACT 2002+ life-cycle impact assessment methods in SimaPro v.7.1.5.
   Characterisation results from the two LCIA methods for Australia's eight state and territory capital cities are presented, together with an overall national profile. These data are also shown on a per capita basis to highlight the relative environmental profiles of citizens in the different cities. Interestingly, many significant impacts occur outside of the capital cities but are linked to facilities providing the majority of their services and products to these urban centres (e.g. power stations, minerals processing). Comparison of the average Australian data with the Netherlands, Western Europe and the World shows the results to be broadly similar.
   Analysis of the CML 2001 baseline characterisation results, on a per capita basis, shows substantial differences between the major cities of the country. In each impact category, these differences can be successfully traced to specific emissions in the raw data sources, the influence of prevailing climate conditions, or factors such as the mix of non-renewable energy resources in each state. Some weaknesses are also evident in the collection and estimation techniques of the raw data sources and in the application of European-based impact assessment models. Australia is a net exporter of many products, particularly natural resources. Therefore, a significant part of the characterisation data presented here for Australia represents products that will be consumed in other parts of the world. Similarly, at a regional level, there will be many inventory items produced in one area yet consumed in another. In this way, the impacts associated with consumption (particularly in densely populated but largely industry-free cities) are dissipated into other production centres.
   This study provides the first set of comprehensive inventory and characterisation data for Australia from a production perspective, disaggregated at a regional level. Despite Australia's unique spatial demography, it is now possible to properly characterise the relative significance of environmental impacts occurring in any of 60 specific regions across the country.
   Australia's unique concentration of urban populations demonstrates the importance of regionally specific environmental assessments. Whilst the data presented in this study will be of most use to Australian LCA practitioners, it is also demonstrative of the broader global distribution of environmental impacts between urban and non-urban areas. The disconnection of environmental impacts between the place of production and the place of consumption is highlighted by this study and should be considered in any studies using these normalisation data for environmental profiling.

AB  - European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is one of the most important forest tree species in Bosnia and Herzegovina from both the economic and ecological aspect. Bosnia and Herzegovina has 3,231,500 ha of forests and forestland, accounting for about 60% of its total area. In the structure of forests and forestland, high forests cover 51.10%, coppices 38.70%, scrubland 4.00%, bare land and clearings 5.80% of the total forest area, while other unproductive areas account for 0.40%. In addition, European beech also occurs in mixed forests of beech and fir, and beech, fir and spruce, which is 46% of all high forests. Consequently, the total area of forests featuring European beech is about 1,652,400 ha. The European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) showed very good horizontal stratification in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It grows, in combination with Sessile oak (Fagetum submontanum), in the lowest forest belts, further it can be found in hills, where it forms pure stands (Fagetum montanum), and finally in mountain areas, mixed with common fir or with both fir and spruce, forming most important community of mixed beech and fir forests (Abieti fagetum). The forests growing in the Central Dinarides are very specific; on a very small space there is a broad variety of climate, edaphic, orographic and other factors which all have direct influence on the differentiation of various ecotypes. Biochemical analysis of genetic structure of eight beech populations using 16 isoenzyme gene loci provided significant genetic differentiation. In some of the gene loci variability was high, whereas in some populations monomorphism was identified only for some gene loci. The average number of alleles per locus ranged from 2.3750 in the Velez population to 2.7500 in the Dinara population, while the average number of genotypes in a locus ranged from 2.8750 in the Posusje population to 3.5625 in the Dinara population. The highest heterozygocity was found in the Cemerno population and the lowest in the Velez population. Some of the observed alleles, such as Pgi-BI, represent rare allelles, which is very useful for subsequent determination of seed and plant material provenance, and indicates specific stand markers. Apart from their importance in determining the origin of forest reproductive material, they are also vital for the successful application of management measures. The negative fixation index values in the studied seed stands are indicators of more liberal management. They would not lose much of their genetic potential for adaptation since they possess sufficient genetic variability, as confirmed by this research. Genetic multilocus diversity ranged from 55.26 to 185.29, and genofund diversity was between 1.2000 and 1.3616. The obtained parameter of mean differentiation for all the populations was relatively low and amounted to Dj = 4.86. This parameter indicates the proportion of total diversity and can be assessed with about 95.14 %. This value is conditioned by inter-population and intra-population genetic diversity and by lower differentiation between the populations. The highest differentiation was found in the Posusje population (Dj = 7.58), which points to its high stability and homogeneity in comparison with other populations from this research. In order to maintain natural genetic resources of European beech in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it should be establish dense network of gene banks in situ and ex situ (seed zones, seed stands, clonal and seedling seed orchards), which are necessary for maintaining genetic diversity of the populations.
   On the basis of research each important ecological niche for European beech should have its gene bank, with appropriate collection of genotypes, in order to preserve ecological and physiological features of the populations. Since only partial genetic structure of European beech in Bosnia and Herzegovina was provided by this research, further study is needed in order to perform genetic distribution of seed units of this valuable commercial species. Particular attention should be paid to the delineation of provenances (seed stands), as well as to experimental division based on provenance tests and the study of ecological-physiological properties.

AB  - Avian populations must mount effective immune responses upon exposure to environmental stressors such as avian influenza and xenobiotics. Although multiple immune assays have been tested and applied to various avian species, antibody-mediated immune responses in non-model avian species are not commonly reported due to the lack of commercially available species-specific antibodies. The objectives of the present study were to advance methods for studying wild bird immune responses and to apply these to the evaluation of cytological responses after exposure of American kestrels, Falco sparverius, to a commercial flame retardant mixture containing isopropylated triarylphosphate isomers (ITP). Hatchlings were gavaged daily with safflower oil or 1.5 ug/g bw/day of ITP suspended in safflower oil, then bled on days 9, 17, and 21. The ITP treatment group (n = 18) and a subset of controls (Poly I:C treatment group; n = 10) were injected on days 9 and 15 with a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), a toll-like receptor ligand and synthetic viral mimic, and responses compared to a sham injected control group (n = 8). The hypotheses tested whether kestrels showed immunological differences among treatment groups, genetic sex, and/or white blood cell (WBC) subpopulation type over time. A flow cytometry (FCM) gating strategy categorized heterophils (H), lymphocytes (L), and monocytes (M) and their proportions, and measured relative fluorescence in response to anti-chicken CD4 binding. Fluorescent cell surfaces and some granular/vacuolar inclusions were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy. A fourth subpopulation with higher levels of granularity than M but less than H became increasingly apparent with time and was gated along with the H subpopulation; its frequency of occurrence was lowest in the ITP group (P = 0.0023). The percentages of cells differed among treatment groups, days, and sexes (P = 0.0001). For both sexes, percentages of H and L were higher than M in control and Poly I:C. In the ITP group, L percentages were higher than H and M (P = 0.0457), and H and L were higher than M on days 9 and 21 (P = 0.0001). The ratios of H:L and H:WBC, indicators of robust immunity, were also higher on days 9 and 21 than on 17 (P = 0.0079). For each sex, the highest levels of activity measured by FCM geometric means (GEO) of fluorescence (indicative of antibody binding) were observed on day 9 (P = 0.0001 female, and P = 0.0011 male) in H over both L and M (P < 0.0001 for each). In males, GEO of the Poly I:C group was higher than that of the ITP group (P = 0.0374), with no difference observed among females over all days. By using a FCM algorithm for population comparisons of fluorescence to investigate binding within H, the T(x) scores indicated higher fluorescence in control and Poly I:C groups over ITP (P = 0.0001). Unlike chickens, Gallus gallus, which express CD4 primarily on L, kestrels bound the commercial antibody primarily within the gated H subpopulation, suggesting an immunophenotypic difference between taxa, despite a similar to 60% identity of Falco CD4 amino acid sequences with chicken CD4. The emergent cell subset within the gated H presented dendritic-like cell (DLC) morphological and functional properties, apparently serving as an effector cell.
   This study adds interpretive context to ecological investigations of infection and of potential immunomodulation by emerging compounds, whereby the early innate responses are mediated by the various cell subsets serving as useful quantitative markers of immunological condition. Data showed that dietary exposure to ITP was immunosuppressive for male and female kestrels over the course of the experiment, reducing DLC frequency compared to the Poly I:C controls. Heterophils and DLC were important in facilitating innate immunological responses.

AB  - Conservation agriculture through no-till based on cropping systems with high biomass-C input, is a strategy to restoring the carbon (C) lost from natural capital by conversion to agricultural land. We hypothesize that cropping systems based on quantity, diversity and frequency of biomass-C input above soil C dynamic equilibrium level can recover the natural capital. The objectives of this study were to: i) assess the C-budget of land use change for two contrasting climatic environments, ii) estimate the C turnover time of the natural capital through no-till cropping systems, and iii) determine the C pathway since soil under native vegetation to no-till cropping systems. In a subtropical and tropical environment, three types of land use were used: a) undisturbed soil under native vegetation as the reference of pristine level; b) degraded soil through continuous tillage; and c) soil under continuous no-till cropping system with high biomass-C input. At the subtropical environment, the soil under continuous tillage caused loss of 25.4 Mg C ha(-1) in the 0-40 cm layer over 29 years. Of this, 17 Mg C ha(-1) was transferred into the 40-100 cm layers, resulting in the net negative C balance for 0-100 cm layer of 8.4 Mg C ha(-1) with an environmental cost of USD 1968 ha(-1). The 0.59 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) sequestration rate by no-till cropping system promote the C turnover time (soil and vegetation) of 77 years. For tropical environment, the soil C losses reached 27.0 Mg C ha(-1) in the 0-100 cm layer over 8 years, with the environmental cost of USD 6155 ha(-1), and the natural capital turnover time through C sequestration rate of 2.15 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) was 49 years. The results indicated that the particulate organic C and mineral associate organic C fractions are the indicators of losses and restoration of C and leading C pathway to recover natural capital through no-till cropping systems.

AB  - Demand for forest products in Australia exceeds domestic capacity for local production and supply, resulting in a significant trade deficit in forest products of around AUD 2 billion per year. Domestic demand for forest products is forecast to continue increasing because such products are recognised as more sustainable than many alternative materials used in construction and as feedstocks for other industrial processes. There is increasing pressure to establish more forest plantations to meet this need. Tasmania has around 16% of the national plantation estate and large areas of natural forests that have been protected and conserved. However, there has been a recent decline in the area of the plantation estate, both nationally and in Tasmania, mainly due to increasing competition from agricultural land uses, which provide higher returns and drive land prices higher than can be justified by returns from forestry. This declining trend will be hard to reverse, given that substantial new areas are unlikely to be available for greenfield plantation establishment. A more prospective area for expansion is likely to be the establishment of trees on farms. This option has significant potential because strategic investment in trees on farms can create valuable assets for increasing farm-level sustainability, resilience and profitability. The choice of appropriate species and planting configuration can help improve the financial balance sheet, stocks of natural capital and flows of ecosystem services. Past investment motives for tree-planting in Australia have mainly been based on anticipated returns from timber. If more tree-planting is to be achieved in Tasmania in the future, it will have to be on cleared private land, and the investment motivation will need to encompass the broader values of trees beyond wood production. This review explores the prospective investment opportunities to facilitate greater establishment of trees on farms and sets out seven key areas where research and policy effort is needed: engaging with leading agricultural financial institutions; engaging with institutional investors; engaging with grower organisations around 'zero carbon' and 'nature positive' branding; research to support the better quantification and adoption of natural capital and its financial benefits; encouraging joint ventures between the industrial plantation sector and farmers; better monetising the carbon sequestration by trees; and the reinvigoration of social capital around growing trees.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services (ES) require a multidisciplinary approach. The aim of the study was to evaluate regional differences in the values of cultural ES in relation to natural capital in four small pilot regions of the Slovak Republic using a matrix system. The article is an approximation of the connection of the biophysical method of evaluation (matrix system) of cultural ES of natural capital with geospatial data at the regional level in the Slovak Republic. Within the natural potential of the ES cultural categories, we evaluated recreation and tourism, landscape character and aesthetics, natural and cultural heritage, knowledge base, and regional significance for the given region. The highest values of indices in all categories were found in the Brezno region. The results of the pilot regions of the Slovak Republic indicated that the terrain fragmentation in combination with a higher altitude and a larger area of forests and protected areas may represent significant factors influencing the potential of the area to provide the various benefits resulting from cultural ES. Even though there is significant monetary potential of cultural ES in the region, its intensive utilization is not readily apparent.

AB  - We analyse the relationship between individuals' subjective wellbeing (SWB) and measures of their country's sustainability. SWB data are sourced from the World Values Survey; sustainability is measured by ecological footprint (EF) and by components of the World Bank's adjusted net savings (ANS) series. ANS, a measure of weak sustainability, represents changes in a country's capital stock including financial, physical, human and natural capital. We show that an increase in strong sustainability, measured by EF and by ANS's natural capital component, is associated with reductions in SWB over the next decade followed by a rebound in SWB over the subsequent decade. We show also that the perfect substitutability assumptions on which ANS is calculated do not hold. Our findings highlight an important political challenge: governments that run sustainable policies may decrease the near-term wellbeing of citizens. This can reduce government's short-term popularity even though the improved sustainability may raise future wellbeing.

AB  - I conduct a nationwide investigation of the relationship that toxic industrial pollution and the facilities that produce it have with trust and civic engagement within communities. Data on pollution exposure come from the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators Geographic Microdata (RSEI-GM) and Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data sets for the years 1995 to 1999. Data on trust and civic engagement come from the 2000 restricted-access Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (SCCBS). Statistical analyses provide strong support for Freudenburg and Jones' conceptualization of corrosive communities and indicate that exposures to more toxic air pollution associate negatively with various measures of trust, and that increased numbers of TRI facilities associate negatively with various measures of civic engagement. The implication is that exposure to toxic industrial air pollution and the facilities that produce it not only adversely affect the physical health of nearby communities, but also their social well-being and underlying capacities for collective action.

AB  - Purpose of Review Natural capital is a term for the stocks of natural assets (e.g. natural resources and ecosystems) that yield flows of ecosystem services that benefit the economy and human well-being. Forestry is one of the industries with the greatest dependencies on natural capital, as well as having the potential for substantial positive or negative impacts on natural capital. These dependencies and impacts create direct risks to a forestry enterprise's ongoing financial viability, which translate into indirect risks for investors and society. There are growing demands from a variety of stakeholders for more reliable information to assess such risks, but at present, these risks are not always well understood, assessed or communicated in a consistent and comparable way. This paper addresses this problem by applying a standardized methodology to develop the first systematic, evidence-based review and financial materiality assessment of natural capital risks for the Australian forestry sector. Recent Findings The vast potential scope of forestry impacts and dependencies on natural capital can be reduced to twenty key areas of relevance to Australian forestry, of which only seven to nine have been assessed as highly financially material for each of the sub-sectors of softwood plantations, hardwood plantations and native forestry. The majority of risks assessed as highly financially material are related to dependencies on natural capital. This is in part due to the fact that current regulations and certification schemes focus on managing impacts, but tend to overlook dependencies. Nearly all of the natural capital risks rated as highly material are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. An improved understanding of natural capital risks is an important input to better decision-making by forestry enterprises, as well as their lenders and investors, forestry regulators and other relevant stakeholders. This paper contributes to the preparedness of the forestry industry and its stakeholders to address questions about vulnerability to future changes and declining trends in natural capital.

AB  - Changes in living environments due to natural hazards are important indicators that affect livelihood and sustainable development, particularly for those farmers residing in poor and remote regions. The uptake of adaptive measures by these farmers is generally partial or incomplete. Thus, there is a real need to understand better the set of drivers that shapes farmers' decisions of adaptation practices, which help to minimize risks and overcome hazards so that sustainable regional development can be facilitated and maintained. We extend the theoretical framework by adding a psychological driver to the traditional Capital Approach Framework (CAF) to examine the nexus between farmers' perceptions, their adaptive assets (human, physical, financial, social, and natural capitals), and their adaptation strategies. In this study, we use survey data of 916 small-scale Vietnamese farmers to examine the research question by employing a multivariate probit model. Our results suggest that heightened perception increases the propensity of respondents to diversify their income sources away from agricultural activities and engage in better investment management. Government assistance in the form of extension training and microcredit programs demotivates farmers from adaptations, therefore redesignation of these schemes or collaboration with the private sector is necessary. Information obtained from local officers would encourage farmers to widely adapt their livelihood strategies to climate change, we thus suggest that the farmers should utilize this information as much as they can. Along with our finding of the significant impact of farm size on farmers' adaptations adoptions, the "land accumulation" program directly benefits small-scale farmers so that they are motivated to either expand productions or transfer land ownership by participating in the land market. The application of this program may help other countries to avoid land fragmentation and abandonment to ensure farmers' livelihood under climate change.

AB  - Three-dimensional ecological footprint method is used to distinguish the capital flows and capital stocks of water resources, and measure water ecological footprint size (WEFsize) and water ecological footprint depth (WEFdepth) of 38 regional cities "Four-city Area in Middle China" from 2010 to 2019, and analyze its spatial correlation. The research results are as follows: Firstly, WEEsize, per capita of 38 regional cities in the "Four-city Area in Middle China" from 2010 to 2019 had obvious differences, and with large inter-annual fluctuations. The high value area of water resource capital flows occupancy rate (ORFLOW) was distributed in the 13 regional cities, its average capital flows occupancy rate was more than 80%. The low value area of ORFLOW was distributed in the 18 regional cities. Secondly, the annual average value of WEFdepth in the 23 cities of the "Four-city Area in Middle China" was all greater than 1. The high value area of use ratio of stocks to flows (URFLOWSTOCK) for water resource was distributed in the 8 regional cities, its average value was as high as 6.97. The low value area of water resource URFLOWSTOCK was distributed in the 15 regional cities, its average value was as low as 0.02. Thirdly, the relationship between WEFsize and WEFdepth has significant regional differences on an intercity scale. The utilization level of capital stocks and capital flows presents complementary situation on the whole. Fourthly, during the study period, WEFsize and WEFdepth across regional cities in the "Four-city Area in Middle China" had a positive spatial autocorrelation. WEFsize had H-H cluster mainly in CS of 2010 and 2019, CS, PX and XY of 2014, CS and LD of 2016. WEFdepth was in H-H cluster in BB of 2010, BB and XT of 2014, BB and HN of 2016 and 2019. These findings not only provided a new research method for water ecological footprint analysis by measuring the size and depth of water ecological footprint in "Four-city Area in Middle China", but also provided a theoretical basis for sustainable utilization of water resources in other urban agglomerations.

AB  - Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is prone to climate shock and is highly sensitive to minor climate variance. Yet, there is a dearth of studies evaluating the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of the socio-ecological system. We assessed the household (n = 1346) and village (n = 77) level adaptive capacity and vulnerability to climate stress in Beas, Bhagirathi, and Teesta basins of IHR following a bottom-up approach. The estimation of adaptive capacity scores for surveyed households and villages were done based on preselected indicator scores of the natural, human, financial, and physical capital assets. The exposure to climate shock was obtained from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) data of different scenarios. The present and future vulnerability scores were assessed based on the adaptive capacity, exposure and sensitivity to climatic shock. The villages and households were grouped in resilient and vulnerable clusters, and major indicators determining the vulnerability were identified. Our result revealed the household and village level adaptive capacity were low in the Bhagirathi and Teesta basin compared to the Beas basin, so as the present and future climate shock. We found that access to different resources as well as natural and financial capital assets were the major governing factor for the adaptive capacity of the villages. We suggest future policy interventions to be on climate sensitive sectors, mostly the natural capital of the region as part of the adaptation and mitigation strategy to climate change.

AB  - Aim As part of the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa, Liberia has pledged to include the value of nature in national decision making through natural capital accounting. Surveying species of concern, such as the western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), which was recently reclassified as "critically endangered" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and identifying protection priority areas are critical first steps towards achieving Liberia's goal to conserve 30% of its remaining forests and supporting the wave of conservation projects taking place in the country.
   Location Liberia, Africa.
   Methods We modelled western chimpanzee habitat suitability, focusing on determining relevant environmental predictors and the most appropriate scale for modelling species-habitat relationships. We built models at six resolutions (30-960 m) to identify scale domains where relationships remain constant. We include several habitat variables that have not been included in prior modelling efforts. We then used the suitability map as the conductance input into a connectivity analysis using Circuitscape.
   Results The amount of forest within 1-3 km was the most important predictor of chimpanzee occurrence. Variable ranks and importance shifted considerably between modelling scales, supporting the need for multiscale investigations, but scale domains were present. Several important corridors for chimpanzee habitat and movement overlap considerably with existing timber and palm oil concessions and overlap mining and rubber concessions to a lesser degree.
   Main conclusions The proportion of primary forest within 1-3 km is critically important for chimpanzee habitat. Ongoing conservation projects and efforts taking place in Liberia including the Good Growth Partnership and the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa can utilize the spatial findings on connectivity provided by this study to inform future conservation decisions, particularly expanding exiting protected areas.

AB  - Considering rapid urbanization worldwide, concern is growing that the resulting loss of green space affects welfare negatively. This study assesses how implicit prices of green amenities differ across apartments in different price groups to assess distributional impact of urban green amenities. Additionally, the paper proposes adjustments to enhance the standard hedonic model and increase comparability of estimates across study areas. Sales data for 6614 apartments in the suburbs of Stockholm, Sweden, an area that is relatively more prone to land conversion, were combined with GIS data on green urban areas and assessed in a simple log-linear model and quantile regression model. The results suggest that forested area even in a in a city with abundant green areas, have an impact on apartment prices. The price effect of green amenities differs strongly across both categories of 'green area' such as parks and forests, as well as, between the mean and the ends of the distribution of apartment prices. The proposed adjustments and results could be of use to other study areas.

AB  - Undoubtedly, coal is playing an important role in shaping today's world. But, excessive extraction of coal has created several adverse effects on the local economy as well as on the global economy. In this study, the households' vulnerability to coal mining operations is assessed by taking two indicators, i.e., the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and livelihood effect index (LEI) in active coal mining and non-mining villages of Talcher Coalfields region of Angul district of Odisha, India. The mining village has shown more vulnerability than the non-mining village in both indices. In LVI, natural disaster, climate variation, and environmental quality (NDCVEQ) indicator is the dominant factor that greatly impacted the overall vulnerability level of the households followed by water (W), health (H), and finance (FIN). Out of the five capitals of LEI, natural capital and financial capital have been affected more due to coal mining activities in the mining village, than the non-mining village. This reflects that households in the mining village are more susceptible to various environmental related issues, and hence, they need to adopt adequate measures to cope up with the issues created from mining operations. Additionally, the mining companies are needed to undertake effective steps to curtail the negative externalities and protect the interests of the local inhabitants.

AB  - The ecosystem service (ES) approach usually addresses soil erosion as the regulating service control of erosion rates or soil retention. In addition to the assessment of this regulating ES, mitigated impacts on soil-related ES by preventing soil erosion can be assessed. This study presents a scenario-based approach for the assessment of the impact of soil erosion on soil-related ES. The assessment approach was tested in agricultural landscapes in Northern Germany, combining mapping and assessment of soil-related ES. In six scenarios, the degradation of soils due to soil erosion was simulated by the calculation of soil profile reductions. The scenarios represent two levels of impact with three time steps (+50, +100, +150 years). In the scenarios for the structural impact, the potential soil erosion rates were extrapolated into the future to generate spatially explicit information on degraded soils. In the scenarios for the mitigated impact, the actual soil erosion rates were extrapolated. Four soil-related ES were assessed for the initial state and the scenarios crop provision, water filtration, water flow regulation and fresh water provision. The comparison of the potential service supply of the four soil-related ES in the scenarios enabled the assessment of the long-term effect of the ES control of erosion rates. The mitigated reduction in the potential service supply for three of the considered ES (crop provision, water filtration, water flow regulation) is large and highlights the importance of sustainable soil management. Contrary to this, the ES fresh water provision benefits of erosion-induced soil profile reductions.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how geospatial technologies, especially remote sensing, can play a leading role in defining urban sustainability based on the evaluation of demand and supply of ecosystem services (ES). A brief review of sustainable development and urban sustainability will be given followed by demonstrations of the need for green spaces in cities, and the consequences of fragmentation of green spaces on biodiversity. Although there are no substantive figures for desirable levels of green spaces in urban areas for the benefit of inhabitants, the paper proposes minimum desirable areal percentages. The paper defines natural capital and ES and the procedures adopted by researchers in balancing the supply and demand for ES for urban areas. The genuine progress indicator is presented as a measure of assessing human welfare, but it is not pursued as an indicator of sustainability. Examples of the applications of remote sensing technologies for determining supply and demand of ES are reviewed as are the potential of the supply and demand of ES to support decision-making in urban areas, to ensure that development decisions are sustainable and are in the best interests of the urban residents who depend on ES for their life support.

AB  - The paper proposes a qualitative valuation method for cultural ecosystem services (CES) based on the analysis of myths, which are interpreted as returns generated by the interaction between natural and human capital (in time and space). Those returns become investments that add up, contribute to form, eventually become, and are accounted as cultural capital. The myths, therefore, are CES indicators (of the time and place where and when they were produced) and can be interpreted as measures of the CES flows. Moreover, some myths eventually survive and add up to a society present cultural capital that produces both cultural and economic value.
   In this perspective, the methodology aims at scrutinizing the content of the myths in terms of (1) socioeconomic milieu and ecosystems that have produced the myth, (2) main messages displayed by the myth (3) key identification elements of the myths and (4) influence and bequest in cultural capital and culture formation and current cultural attitude towards the ecosystem service. This allows to qualitatively analyse the features, the rates of depletion and accumulation of the cultural capital, eventually produced by ecosystems.
   The methodology is applied to the cultural services provided by vine and wine. We analyse myths from 5000 b. C to 100 a.C., told in the fertile Triangle of the Vine (Eurasia, including India) to the Mediterranean basin. Results show that myths are an expression of human and natural capital of the time and space, when and where they were generated. However, they convey cultural values, related to the vine and wine, that are still existing and can be identified and accounted as cultural capital. In this perspective, the CES, through the myths, tell a story of small prehistoric wild vine shoots that were able to create long-lasting civility and culture still affecting several dimensions of current cultural capital, like attitude to wine consumptions, figurative arts, intellectual thinking, among selected aspects.

AB  - The maintenance of the total natural capital stocks has received increased attention worldwide for its ability to achieve sustainable development. However, the claim that ecosystem services (ES) contribute to sustainability has not been sufficiently verified. In this study, we explore how major ecosystem functions affect food, energy, and water (FEW) sustainability. This research addresses the importance of ecosystems and services provided, which sustainability depends on. Specific types of sustainability - food, energy, water, and fundamental ES with regional GDP are chosen to exam this relationship using the pressure-state-response framework. The results show that ecosystem services are indispensable keys to successfully achieving sustainable development goals. The research findings also illustrate a scheme for emphasizing how economic development can be a factor contributing to a multi-objective case study. Our approach may help guide future cooperative applications to achieve food, energy, and water sustainability while protecting ecosystem services.

AB  - Mountains are characterized by their specificities such as fragility, marginality and remoteness. They are prone to various hazards such as drought, flood, forest fire, landslide and therefore physical, ecological and social systems of the mountains are at risk. Climate change adds to intensifying the magnitude of multi-hazard risk in mountains. The present study attempts to evaluate risk induced by multi-hazard and climate change in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework. The proposed multi-hazard risk index was based on indicators from a broader domain and applied on 109 administrative districts of IHR. Exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and coping capacity were defined using comprehensive and sub-regional indicators identified through inductive and deductive approaches. The result showed that the differential risks among the districts of IHR were governed by the multiplicity of the factor such as demography, amenities, natural capital, partnership, technology and spatial specificities of the districts. The result highlighted the need of inclusion of spatial specificities for the risk mitigation in the IHR and therefore a Mountain Specific Risk Management Framework (MSMRMF) was proposed for sustaining the mountainous communities. The proposed MSMRMF contained two broad components as risk assessment and risk addressal. The framework detailed the risk mitigation and coping strategies (based on adjustment of internal and external strengths) for addressing risks. Risk mitigation was proposed to achieved through habitation resilience, natural capital enhancement, external partnerships, climate change adaptation, and technological interventions. The framework would provide an insight of risk and risk management strategies for the multi-hazard prone mountain regions for the sustainable development under the global change.

AB  - Monitoring, visitor dynamics and their nature-based experiences is an important dimension in the conservation management of protected areas. In the current digital age, the content analysis of social media information is being increasingly used in such a context. However, research testing whether social media content analysis provides similar information to that obtained from slated preference methods is lacking. We aimed to identify differences in the classification of tourist profiles and nature-based experiences, both from online social surveys and photo content analysis. Our approach targeted Flickr's social media users visiting two Biosphere Reserves in Southern Europe: Donana and Sierra Nevada. We manually classified the main content of Flickr photos considering different categories of tourist profiles and nature-based experiences. Concurrently, we distributed online surveys to Flickr users responsible for those photos and gathered theft self-stated classification of tourist profiles and experiences. Finally, we compared the classification results from both content analysis and online surveys using multiple congruence metrics and tests. Overall, we found both matches and mismatches between the results from content analysis and online surveys depending on the categories of tourist profiles and their experiences. "Landscape and species" was the only category with consistent matches between content analysis and online surveys for both tourist profiles and nature-based experiences. We suggest that conclusions based on content analysis or online surveys alone can lead to incomplete information. instead, the adoption of both content analysis and online surveys should provide complementary perspectives for the monitoring of nature's cultural capital.

AB  - In Ethiopia, large investments have been made into watershed development activities over the past decades. There is, however, limited quantified information on ecological and socioeconomic benefits of these investments. This study assessed the livelihood benefits of community-based watershed development (CBWD) in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. We compared livelihood capital of rural households from three conserved micro-watersheds (Guansa, Tija Baji and Adef Wuha) and one control micro-watershed (Tata). Participatory workshops were conducted with stakeholders to identify indicators that would be affected by watershed development intervention. A cross-sectional survey research design was employed to collect information from 157 systematically selected households from the four micro-watersheds. Linear standardization method was used to produce indicators with range between 0 and 1. After standardization, we calculated the value of each type of livelihood capital and finally the overall livelihood capital indices. One-way ANOVA was used to assess mean differences in livelihood asset between conserved and non-conserved sites. The findings revealed that the overall livelihood capital indices of Adef Wuha (0.45), Guansa (0.52) and Tija Baji (0.46) were better than the control micro-watershed (0.43). The livelihood improvement was significant (P < 0.05) at Guansa while the improvement was little at Adef Wuha and Tija Baji, compared to the control watershed. Concerning individual livelihood capitals, the natural capital at Guansa, and human capital at Guansa and Tija Baji watersheds showed significant improvement. However, human capital improvement at Adef Wuha, natural capital at Tija Baji and financial capital at Guansa and Adef Wuha were not significant. It is concluded that CBWD has livelihood benefits, but extents are likely to be context specific due to differences in baseline situations. We recommend a detailed cost-benefit analysis study to evaluate benefits against investment costs.

AB  - Urban floods have become more frequent across the globe. The transformation of the urban landscape with increased concretization and dwindling green cover has resulted in excess run-off generation thereby causing the flash floods. The protective role and ecosystem benefits of urban green spaces needs to be quantified so that it will unlock the possibilities of integrating natural capital thinking into policymaking. Hence in this study, we quantified the flood mitigation service of green spaces and estimated the tangible economic damage to the built infrastructure in the Hyderabad metropolitan city, India using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model. The analysis was carried out for 2-years and 5-years design precipitation of 1 h duration. Results show that 44-50% of the precipitation is retained by the urban green and open spaces. With an increase of 13% in the rainfall intensity (from 2-years to 5-years), the run-off volume has increased by 21%, while the run-off retained has increased only by 5%, which indicates that even slight increase in rainfall intensity results in huge run-off generation that causes commensurate economic damages. The economic damage due to flood inundation of the built infrastructure is estimated to be 1.39 million USD using the unit cost method. Overall, the indicator of run-off retention service is quantified as 4.25E + 13 and 4.46E + 13 for the 2-years and 5-years return period precipitation, respectively. The structural and non-structural flood mitigation measures are also enumerated along with the limitations of the model.

KW  - CURSE
AB  - The inclusive wealth approach is increasingly common to measure the sustainable development of the countries. It comprised the natural, human and produced capital of nations to measure social wellbeing. We measure the inclusive wealth of the provinces in China from 2000 to 2015 and reports the sustainable use of the resources. We identify that three types of capital have increased to varying degrees, with produced capital increasing by 615.6%, natural capital increasing by 33.8%, and human capital increased by 337.0%. The total amount of inclusive wealth has increased by 300.4% in the past 15 years. However, the provinces in China are still facing unbalanced development across the country compared to developed nations. The use of the natural capital, more specifically now-renewable resources, has been restricting the wealth growth in some provinces. Although ecological services account for a small proportion of the total inclusive wealth, more attention is essential for sustainable development. Meanwhile, the rapid growth of carbon damages posed threat to future wealth accumulation. Innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development are the goals of China 13th and 14th five-year plan and our inclusive wealth of China will be key measurement tool of this achievement.

AB  - Taking into account the declaration from the Treaty of Rome (back in 1957), on environmental protection "the harmonization of environmental legislations and uniformity in the fight against certain forms of aid, so that technical barriers to the free circulation of goods would not arise due to different national links", there is a need to develop Strategy(ies) in the Framework of Waste Management in order to reach the targets on 2050. Those Strategies aim to increase quality of life and change the way that citizens react in the great debates. Those Strategies should reduce the impact of several processes on the environment through product, processes, and corporate policies using green applicable sustainable resources and environmental management systems (such as ISO 14001, EMAS) as well as a number of activities (prevention, reduced, reused etc) measuring at the same time the impact on society. This paper provides a holistic approach processing how to develop, implement, monitor and improve a strategy (even an existing one) in the framework of waste management at a local level and or at a central level. The proposed methodology could be a useful tool for any policy makers, consultants, engineers, urban planners, academics etc., in order to develop and apply strategy related with household and/or food waste prevention, material reuse, waste reduce (i.e plastics, food, recyclables etc)., in the framework of household solid waste management and beyond. Moreover, the adoption of Strategy(ies) also aims to protect and enhance the Union's natural capital and to turn the Union into a resource-efficient, green, and competitive low-carbon economy in the nearest future taking into acount also the European Green Deal stategy.

AB  - The wine sector is paying more attention to sustainable wine production practices, but this topic is highly debated because organic viticulture aims to a reduction of environmental impacts, while conventional viticulture ensures an increase of yield. This work provides an economic and environmental comparison using different indicators whereas no previous studies on viticulture have faced on both aspects of sustainability. Two distinct vineyards within the same case study farm were considered, where conventional and organic viticulture practices were applied for 5 years. For each type of production, we calculated the economic benefit and environmental indicators such as the Water Footprint, Carbon Footprint, and an indicator of environmental performance associated with the vineyard phase ("Vineyard Management" or "Vigneto" indicator part of the Italian VIVA certification framework). This latter considers six subindicators investigating pesticides management, fertilizers management, organic matter content, soil compaction, soil erosion, and landscape quality. The multi criteria approach is a novel framework assessing sustainability on vineyard management using environmental indicators from VIVA calculator and the economic aspect. Main results showed that organic management in viticulture can be applied without having economic losses and with the benefit of better preserving the natural capital. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Building on the current international discourse and United Nation's System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) this study provides further empirical evidences on how failure to include natural capital resources in national accounting leads to erroneous calculation of macroeconomic estimates. The SEEA methodological framework for integrating natural capital into the System of National Accounts amplifies analytical power of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and allows to investigate relationship between the economy and the environment. This paper integrates values of natural capital into Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) to illustrate depletion of forest due to natural disaster. It further applies CGE model to demonstrate economy-wide effects of a real event in which hurricane felled almost 80 thousands hectares of trees in Polish forests in 2017. The model results corresponds with the statistical data published after the mentioned event. Furthermore they align with findings of previous studies, which applied different methodical approach and show that without natural capital accounting the macroeconomic estimates provide misleading information about economic performance.

AB  - The well-being of people living around protected areas is critical in its own right as well as for effective conservation, particularly in human-dominated landscapes. We examine the contributions of financial, social, and natural capital to household food access of 883 households around Kanha National Park (KNP) in central India over three seasons. We use regression trees and mixed effects models to identify associations between natural, social, and financial capital indicators and household food access (an indicator of well-being). We find that food access is low in the KNP landscape with over 80% of households indicating lower than acceptable food consumption scores, with a further worsening in monsoon season. Financial capital (e.g., salaried jobs and proximity to towns for all seasons) is most prominently associated with higher food consumption scores. Moreover, households supplement incomes by converting social capital (e.g., 28% of surveyed households access "food in lieu of work or credit" in monsoon) and natural capital (e.g., 14% of surveyed households sold forest products in summer) to financial capital seasonally. Financial capital dwarfs contributions of social and natural capital around KNP, in contrast to other studies, which suggest that gains from natural capital are essential for well-being of people around protected areas. Management interventions, such as kitchen gardens (borne from human capital) to supplement market-bought produce, could contribute to food security without high financial inputs. However, food insecurity in the KNP landscape primarily relates to the lack of financial capital. Food security of people around protected areas in other human-dominated landscapes is likely to be context-specific and counter to frequent assumptions particularly as livelihood strategies change with increasing economic opportunities.

AB  - Supply risks and shortages of fossil fuels are major challenges to the sustainable development of countries. In response to this challenge, the 12th main goal of the Sustainable Development Goals emphasizes the importance of sustainable consumption and production patterns for resource (including fossil fuels) sustainability. However, for China, the world's largest energy consumer, the availability and criticality of fossil fuels to economic development have not been studied at sub-national scales. Understanding these can help fossil fuel management and the implementation of policies in different regions. This study is the first to analyse the scarcity-weighted fossil fuel footprint in China at the provincial level for 2012 using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model and a newly proposed scarcity evaluation indicator. Using scarcity-weighted indicators allows us to identify supply insecurities that are not revealed when focusing on fossil fuel extraction. The scarcity-weighted fossil fuel indicators identify new critical regions such as Hunan and Hubei. We also find that interprovincial export is a major driver of fossil fuel depletion in less-developed regions (e.g., 83% for Shanxi). This study can help regions in China identify fossil fuel supply risks from the viewpoint of their natural capital endowment and resource depletion in relation to final demand. More importantly, the research findings provide a valuable reference for policymakers when reassessing sustainability not only for fossil fuels but also for other natural resources at multiple scales within and beyond China.

AB  - Liberia and Gabon joined the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa (GDSA), established in 2012, with the goal of incorporating the value of nature into national decision making by estimating the multiple services obtained from ecosystems using the natural capital accounting framework. In this study, we produced 30-m resolution 10 classes land cover maps for the 2015 epoch for Liberia and Gabon using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to support the ongoing natural capital accounting efforts in these nations. We propose an integrated method of pixel-based classification using Landsat 8 data, the Random Forest (RF) classifier and ancillary data to produce high quality land cover products to fit a broad range of applications, including natural capital accounting. Our approach focuses on a pre-classification filtering (Masking Phase) based on spectral signature and ancillary data to reduce the number of pixels prone to be misclassified; therefore, increasing the quality of the final product. The proposed approach yields an overall accuracy of 83% and 81% for Liberia and Gabon, respectively, outperforming prior land cover products for these countries in both thematic content and accuracy. Our approach, while relatively simple and highly replicable, was able to produce high quality land cover products to fill an observational gap in up to date land cover data at national scale for Liberia and Gabon.

AB  - National and international governments aim to promote the responsible management of the natural capital but measuring its contribution to economic growth is still a challenging exercise. The natural capital supports a plurality of environmental functions whereas the economic growth is frequently measured by aggregated indicators. In this paper, we propose an extended version of the Genuine Saving macro indicator to account for water and soil depletion. Further, as natural capital is spatially heterogeneous we estimate Genuine Saving for Italy for the period 2000-2015 at the regional level. Whilst the case study produces specific results for Italy the methodological framework is broadly applicable to other states. The Italian comparison shows that soil and water provide an absolute change of roughly 1% of the GS but average relative regional variations are between 5 and 33% of GDP, showing that the geographical scale of sustainability analysis is a crucial element for responsible management of national assets. The methodological contribution suggests that the Genuine Saving can support policy makers in developing targeted policies for sustainable growth.

AB  - People are increasingly affected by climate change. In response, some people adapt, but others may not. The aim of our research was to understand what factors influence successful adaptation to climate change in context. We surveyed rural small-scale farmers in Eswatini who had recently experienced a severe drought, and collected data on adaptive capacity, measured as household access to five types of capital: natural (access to and use of natural resources), social (integration within local social networks), financial (income and wealth), physical (access to assets and infrastructure), and human (education and employment). Our goals were to identify which type of capital was most important in driving adaptation and to identify the specific ways in which capital supported adaptation. We found that social capital and natural capital increased successful drought adaptation more than other types of capital. Primarily, social and natural capital increased access to other resources and opportunities that enabled adaptation. Our research highlights the complex pathways along which capital operates to support adaptation, and furthers our understanding of in-situ adaptation experiences.

AB  - Companies and investors have an important role to play in preventing further degradation of the natural environment and supporting its improvements. This requires decision-useful, readily available corporate reporting and investment analysis on environmental impacts and dependencies. There are pressures on providing such information, driven by movements within climate change reporting, uptake of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and increasing expectation for more transparency in reporting and analysis. Although sustainability reporting and environmental social and governance (ESG) analysis are evolving, they are not deemed 'fit for purpose' to meet all the changes currently on the horizon. eftec developed the Natural Capital Statements to fill this gap. The 'NatCapStatements(TM)' are a combination of the income statement and balance sheet for natural capital assets, mostly using the data already being collected by companies and analysts. Based on the relatable structure of traditional financial accounts, the NatCapStatements(TM) report (i) the impacts of a company on natural capital; (ii) how dependent a company is on natural capital and (iii) whether the company is prepared for future risks and opportunities from the environment. To demonstrate this approach, this article presents an independent assessment of the NatCapStatements(TM) of Swedish paper and pulp company SCA.

AB  - The ecosystem services of rivers and watersheds (also called catchments) should be considered in pursuit of integrated catchment planning, decision-making, and management to sustain and/or enhance this important natural capital. To determine if and how river and watershed studies have been accounting for ecosystem services, 25 years of ecosystem service-related river and watershed studies were reviewed. The most commonly studied ecosystem services for rivers and watersheds were recreation (41% of studies), food (29%) and climate regulation (26%). Many of the studies also focused on three ecosystem service themes: modelling (91%), mapping (80%), and economic valuation (72%); 58% of the studies investigated all three of these themes. It is important to note that the majority of the ecosystem service related studies only focused their investigation on a handful of ecosystem services; hence, the potential externalities for the non-focal ecosystem services may have been overlooked.

AB  - There are very few documented experiences of agroecological management in extensive systems of temperate zones, particularly those that utilize native grasslands. Therefore, we evaluate the feasibility of the transition from conventional to agroecological management of a farm operation based in the utilization of native grasslands, selecting and validating indicators to evaluate the trajectory of this transition. We used indicators easy to calculate, which showed sensitivity to the production changes. The results obtained in the third year of the agroecological reconversion showed that most of the indicators of the productive dimension (productivity of the natural grassland, forage species cover, state of the breeding herd), environmental dimension (land cover, species richness, decomposition rate of feces) and economic efficiency dimension (gross margin) substantially improved during the reconversion process. This result shows that there is not always a compromise between the preservation of natural capital and the economic benefits. The critical point to ensure the sustainability of these agroecosystems corresponds to the social dimension (land tenure, and the settling down and social relationships of the farmer).

AB  - Accounting is an important practical mechanism by which corporations are held to account for their performance and impact. This is consequential for corporate responsibility for the conservation of natural capital. While there is clear evidence of increasing corporate accounting and reporting with respect to aspects of natural capital, however, such efforts are at best nascent. This is in part because the purpose and meaning of corporate natural capital accounting is not in itself well established, and in part because existing institutional structures and incentives do not lend themselves to giving a full account of natural capital impact. In this context, the paper argues that there is essentially a need for natural capital accounting and reporting systems that serve two distinct purposes. The first, which is the more likely to be satisfied by existing market structures, is oriented towards the informational needs of shareholders and is concerned with supporting a transition towards environmentally sustainable business models. The second, in contrast, acknowledges that a shareholder-oriented perspective constrains natural capital to be important if, and only if, its conservation privately affects shareholders, which is unlikely to ensure an accounting that contributes to the conservation of natural capital as an end in itself. This second purpose of strengthening corporate natural capital accountability is unlikely to be satisfied within existing market structures; instead, it stands in need of a regulatory solution.

It describes the basis on which the accounts have been constructed, discusses key issues which have arisen, and presents the results to date. It also sets out how restoration accounts' for individual projects can not only facilitate conventional cost-benefit analysis but also add to relevant material for decision-makers. More widely, the paper describes how natural capital accounts can underpin well-based decision-makingfor example, in implementation of the UK government's new 25-year plan for the environment. In addition, by providing information on one of the missing capitals', such accounts can augment analysis of the behaviour of the economy generally.

AB  - Despite the increasing interest of the Sustainable Livelihood Framework in the field of international development and in academia and the recent call for the use of mixed-methods approach, there has been little analysis that brings together qualitative and quantitative methods over a large geographical extent. Based on findings from participatory rural appraisals during which participants identified the key assets needed to achieve their livelihoods, this paper argues that common-pool resources (community capitals) should be differentiated from private goods (household capitals) as they operate under different dynamics of decision-making and management. We then create quantitative indicators that can be mapped across a large geographical extent by using data derived from national census and satellite sensors. Spatial patterns and differentials in access to livelihood capitals across the case study are examined and the associations that exist between household capitals, between community capitals, and between both are quantified. The results demonstrate that household physical capital is positively associated with household financial and social capitals but negatively associated with household natural capital, supporting the hypothesis that households trade their natural assets to cope with shocks. It is also shown that proximity to main axes of communication increases access to village amenities but decreases access to natural resources, while remoteness increases household human capital but decreases household physical and financial capitals. Such a cross-scale study adds to the understanding of the question of scale regarding rural livelihoods and community development, which could act as a bridge between the implementation of policy programmes (often targeted at the community level) and their expected outcomes (often targeted at the household level).

AB  - Farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Plains produce much of the wheat and rice grown in India. However, food production and millions of farm-based livelihoods in this region will continue to be adversely affected by hydro-climatic change and variation, reduced land productivity, and declining groundwater levels. Thus, agricultural adaptations are essential for protecting and improving upon intersecting goals of food security, poverty alleviation, and wellbeing. Household "capital" (e.g., natural, human, financial, physical, and social) is commonly cited as an indicator of livelihood adaptability and innovation. We develop a series of mediated structural equation models to empirically evaluate the validity of capital as a suitable indicator for adaptation and adaptive capacity. These models assess the extent to which household capital mediates the relationship between over 1,000 socio-economically differentiated and randomly selected farm households, and their crop, livestock, and land management adaptations in the states of Haryana and Bihar. Central to our models is a single household capital variable, constructed by aggregating nearly 80 different measurements of households' (i) physical/infrastructural capital, (ii) owned or accessed assets, (iii) livelihood diversity, (iv) ability to reach market or commercialize, (v) access to weather information, and (vi) social capital. We find household capital is a significant predictor in adopting crop, land management, and livestock-related adaptation strategies across both states. Second, and in certain cases, lower castes and less educated households engaged in fewer agricultural adaptations-an outcome mediated by their lower composition of capital. Further, and across almost all contexts, household capital mediated the effect of owning a greater proportion of land, and the higher uptake of agricultural adaptation activities. While improvements in any capital category can improve adoption, we recommend programs that improve (i) access to public and private agricultural infrastructure for lower castes; (ii) education and shared knowledge spaces for less-educated households; and (iii) the availability of low-interest loans and the more efficient legal transfer of land for agriculturalists owning a smaller proportion of their land. Through this novel and large-scale analysis of household data, we provide short-term and immediate recommendations for more equitable agricultural adaptation in this breadbasket region of northern India.

AB  - Land is a highly valuable natural resource, where all human activities take place by exploiting natural goods for socio-economic development. The competition for land resources is increasing with pristine soils of unoccupied land being very precious for agricultural use (food production) and infrastructure development. International efforts have been made in assessing and quantifying the natural capital reserves and ecosystem services through lately led conceptual approaches such as the land and ecosystems extend accounting. This research conducted at the national level of Greece and in the 14 river basin districts (RBDs), revealed the main drivers of change in land cover stocks, as well as future trends in a non-spatially explicit context. In Greece, the analysis for the last 23 years has shown that the land resources are intensively exploited with significant piece of land being transformed into urban fabric and other man-transformed surfaces supporting a more urbanized manner of socio-economic development. The expansion of artificial surfaces is a phenomenon met in all RBDs of the country. The significant reduction of forests increases the flood risks, especially in peri-urban areas, while the reduction of forests in low-lying lands used for intense agriculture reduces aquifer recharge and impairs water quality due to the use of fertilizers and pesticides. An attempt has been made to estimate the main trends with a 50-year projection horizon; the current trends are anticipated to continue (+17% expansion of urban fabric) with significant land surface being converted from natural to other uses.

AB  - Tropical estuaries are one of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet because of the number of ecosystem services they provide. The increasing anthropogenic pressure to which these estuaries are subject has caused a reduction in their natural capital stock. Therefore, the application of a pragmatic and rational ecosystem-based management approach to sustainably manage the multiple ecosystem services provided by this ecosystem is necessary. The aim of our study is to present an approach that combines prospective scenarios with habitat-based perspective to assess the supply capacity of ecosystem services, plus determine the impact of protected areas in an urbanized tropical estuary. The current situation and two scenarios were generated to evaluate the capacity of habitats to supply ecosystem services. This type of assessment will allow the decision makers to visualize the effect of their choices or the occurrence of events which might produce significant changes in the estuary. Thus, over time, measures can be taken to sustain the supply of ecosystem services. We determined that the establishment of protected areas have a positive impact; however, the effect is not the same for all of them. Consequently, indicating that actions such as community participation, research, education, management planning and infrastructure development must accompany the development of a protected area.

AB  - Ecosystem services (the benefits to humans from ecosystems) are estimated globally at $125 trillion/year [1, 2]. Similar assessments at national and regional scales show how these services support our lives [3]. All valuations recognize the role of biodiversity, which continues to decrease around the world in maintaining these services [4, 5]. The giant panda epitomizes the flagship species [6]. Its unrivalled public appeal translates into support for conservation funding and policy, including a tax on foreign visitors to support its conservation [7]. The Chinese government has established a panda reserve system, which today numbers 67 reserves [8, 9]. The biodiversity of these reserves is among the highest in the temperate world [10], covering many of China's endemic species [11]. The panda is thus also an umbrella species [12]-protecting panda habitat also protects other species. Despite the benefits derived from pandas, some journalists have suggested that it would be best to let the panda go extinct. With the recent downlisting of the panda from Endangered to Vulnerable, it is clear that society's investment has started to pay off in terms of panda population recovery [13, 14]. Here, we estimate the value of ecosystem services of the panda and its reserves at between US$2.6 and US$6.9 billion/year in 2010. Protecting the panda as an umbrella species and the habitat that supports it yields roughly 10-27 times the cost of maintaining the current reserves, potentially further motivating expansion of the reserves and other investments in natural capital in China.

AB  - The present study collects original monetary estimates for water related ecosystem service benefits on the African continent from 36 valuation studies. A database of 178 monetary estimates is constructed to conduct a meta-analysis that, for the first time, digs into what factors drive water related ecosystem service values in Africa. We find that the service type, biome and other socioeconomic variables are significant in explaining benefits from water related services. In order to understand the importance that benefits from water related ecosystem services have for climate change, we explore the relationship between these benefits and the countries' vulnerability and readiness to adapt to climate change. We find that countries face synergies and trade-offs in terms of how valuable their water related ecosystem services are and their potential vulnerability and adaptation capacity. While more vulnerable countries are associated with lower benefits from ecosystem services, countries with a higher readiness to adapt are also associated with lower ecosystem service values. Results are discussed in light of natural capital accounting and ecosystem-based adaptation.

AB  - Pelagic ecosystems are dynamic ocean regions whose immense natural capital is affected by climate change, pollution, and commercial fisheries. Trophic level-based indicators derived from fishery catch data may reveal the food web status of these systems, but the utility of these metrics has been debated because of targeting bias in fisheries catch. We analyze a unique, fishery-independent data set of North Pacific seabird tissues to inform ecosystem trends over 13 decades (1890s to 2010s). Trophic position declined broadly in five of eight species sampled, indicating a long-term shift from higher-trophic level to lower-trophic level prey. No species increased their trophic position. Given species prey preferences, Bayesian diet reconstructions suggest a shift from fishes to squids, a result consistent with both catch reports and ecosystem models. Machine learning models further reveal that trophic position trends have a complex set of drivers including climate, commercial fisheries, and ecomorphology. Our results show that multiple species of fish-consuming seabirds may track the complex changes occurring in marine ecosystems.

AB  - Inclusive wealth is a key measuring indicator of sustainable development. Long-term development is a process of accumulation and sound management of a portfolio of assets-manufactured capital, natural capital, human and social capital. Existing indicators for measuring economic progress have many limitations such as GDP and HDI and does not focus on sustainability of the nation. Previous indicators are missing true values from the natural resource. The new indicators such as green GDP, index of sustainable and economic welfare, and genuine progress indicators are concern about sustainability. The major objective of this paper is to estimate the inclusive wealth for South Asia from the period of 1990-2010. This study has used wealth accounting methodology and aggregates the value of produced capital, human capital, forest resources and exhaustible resources. Inclusive wealth is an important instrument for human well-being. The main implication of the paper is inclusive wealth make better decisions for achieving sustainable development for South Asia. Accounting for natural capital strength also is useful for educating decision makers and assessing the relative importance of non-market benefits relative to market benefits.

AB  - The health and productivity of global land resources are declining, while demand for those resources is increasing. The aim of land degradation neutrality (LDN) is to maintain or enhance land-based natural capital and its associated ecosystem services. The Scientific Conceptual Framework for Land Degradation Neutrality has been developed to provide a scientific approach to planning, implementing and monitoring LDN. The Science-Policy Interface of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) led the development of the conceptual framework, drawing in expertise from a diverse range of disciplines.
   The LDN conceptual framework focuses on the supporting processes required to deliver LDN, including biophysical and socio-economic aspects, and their interactions. Neutrality implies no net loss of the land-based natural capital relative to a reference state, or baseline. Planning for neutrality involves projecting the likely cumulative impacts of land use and land management decisions, then counterbalancing anticipated losses with measures to achieve equivalent gains. Counterbalancing should occur only within individual land types, distinguished by land potential, to ensure "like for like" exchanges. Actions to achieve LDN include sustainable land management (SLM) practices that avoid or reduce degradation, coupled with efforts to reverse degradation through restoration or rehabilitation of degraded land. The response hierarchy of Avoid > Reduce > Reverse land degradation articulates the priorities in planning LDN interventions. The implementation of LDN is managed at the landscape level through integrated land use planning, while achievement is assessed at national level.
   Monitoring LDN status involves quantifying the balance between the area of gains (significant positive changes in LDN indicators) and area of losses (significant negative changes in LDN indicators), within each land type across the landscape. The LDN indicators (and associated metrics) are land cover (physical land cover class), land productivity (net primary productivity, NPP) and carbon stocks (soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks).
   The LDN conceptual framework comprises five modules: A: Vision of LDN describes the intended outcome of LDN; B: Frame of Reference clarifies the LDN baseline; C: Mechanism for Neutrality explains the counterbalancing mechanism; D: Achieving Neutrality presents the theory of change (logic model) articulating the impact pathway; and E: Monitoring Neutrality presents the LDN indicators. Principles that govern application of the framework provide flexibility while reducing risk of unintended outcomes.

AB  - One of the main issues with the concept of ecosystem services is its absence on the ground in concrete operational decision-making contexts; that is, an implementation gap. In this study, we investigated if this gap could be overcome through the use of open-source data and free tools, and the adoption of a short-term participatory process. We tested these methods in the context of a project in the urban metropolitan area of Bordeaux (Communaute urbaine de Bordeaux: CUB) in France. The ecosystem services were defined using a participatory approach involving local stakeholders, and then selected scenarios were simulated to test the impact of various development or conservation plans. The study addressed three main questions: (1) Is it possible to adopt a simple methodological approach that overcomes the implementation gap through the development of a user-friendly and inclusive method? (2) What is the added value of a participatory approach? (3) With regards to four scenarios in this territory, what are the ES trends in the selected biophysical and monetary indicators, and will knowledge of these trends help planners to shape a sustainable trajectory for the territory?

AB  - In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the UN General Assembly as a global target to be met by 2030. The 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in November 2016, when the Paris Agreement, aimed at the creation of a low-carbon society, came into force. The world is now taking steps toward solving the globally shared problem of climate change. In addition, it must address a multitude of emerging complex issues related to society, the environment, and the economy. Information and communications technology (ICT) has been a useful tool to tackle such issues and has been successfully applied in many areas. To enable faster response to complex issues, Fujitsu is developing Green ICT services that leverage prediction technology based on big data analysis. The aim is to develop services that offer logical and accurate decision making, with the flexibility of being applicable to a variety of contexts. In this paper, we present a methodology and a technology related to the area of environmental research: a "natural-capital accounting methodology" that can be used to assess natural resources for preserving biodiversity and an "environment, society, and economic analysis technology" that can be used to. Their use can help visualize local attributes, elucidate locally specific problems, and predict the effectiveness of alternative measures.

AB  - This study evaluated the climate change vulnerability of Himalayan communities, and their potential to adapt to these changes, through assessing their perceived reactions and counter-actions to climate change. The evaluation was conducted through proposing and testing indices for vulnerability (Climate Vulnerability Index-CVI) and adaptation (Current Adaptive Capacity Index-CACI) based on the assumption that a community is an active dynamic entity and has tremendous capability to address the impacts of climate change through an ability to make adjustments based on perceived experiences. Both CVI and CACI include the five forms of capital leading to sustainable livelihood,i.e. human, natural, financial, social and physical capital, and were assessed for each of these forms of capital based on the IPCC framework of vulnerability assessment and its three dimensions (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity). Data for the analysis were collected from randomly selected households located away from district headquarters (ADH) and near district headquarters (NDH). Each dimension was measured based on associated socio-environment-specific indicators for assessing vulnerability and sustainability at community level. The results showed that ADH households had higher human capital and natural capital vulnerability than NDH households. In contrast, NDH households had higher social capital and financial capital vulnerability than ADH households. Overall, ADH households had greater vulnerability than NDH households.
   These results improve understanding of the environmental and socio-economic changes affecting rural livelihoods and the measures needed to address their specific vulnerabilities by addressing bottlenecks in education and training facilities for skill up-grading, increasing interaction opportunities through local functions and creating opportunities for income generation and effective market and farm linkages. An attempt was made to reduce the gap between bottom-up understanding and top-down policies by suggesting precautionary and ongoing adaptation practices for the communities studied, leading to effective and efficient addressal of vulnerabilities. Vulnerability in the study context was taken to mean externally driven change leading to disturbance in the human environment that could alter internal and external livelihood settings.

AB  - Social responsibility is the responsibility of an organization for the impact of its decisions and activities on the society and environment through transparent and ethical behavior that is consistent with sustainable development and the welfare of society. Since the business plays a pivotal role in both the job and wealth creation in the society and efficient use of natural capital, CSR is a central management concern which positions companies to manage risk and take advantage of opportunities. The present study deals with the issue of corporate social responsibility reporting practices being followed by selected companies in India. The study has been conducted by analysing annual reports of selected companies using content analysis. Certain indicators have been selected on the basis of Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and UNCTAD principles.

AB  - Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem service science has made much progress in framing core concepts and approaches, but there is still debate around the notion of cultural services, and a growing consensus that ecosystem use and ecosystem service use should be clearly differentiated. Part of the debate resides in the fact that the most significant sources of conflict around natural resource management arise from the multiple managements (uses) of ecosystems, rather than from the multiple uses of ecosystem services.
   If the ecosystem approach or the ecosystem service paradigm are to be implemented at national levels, there is an urgent need to disentangle what are often semantic issues, revise the notion of cultural services, and more broadly, practically define the less tangible ecosystem services on which we depend. This is a critical step to identifying suitable ways to manage trade-offs and promote adaptive management.
   Here we briefly review the problems associated with defining and quantifying cultural ecosystem services and suggest there could be merit in discarding this term for the simpler non-material ecosystem services. We also discuss the challenges in valuing the invaluable, and suggest that if we are to keep ecosystem service definition focused on the beneficiary, we need to further classify these challenging services, for example by differentiating services to individuals from services to communities. Also, we suggest that focussing on ecosystem service change rather than simply service delivery, and identifying common boundaries relevant for both people and ecosystems, would help meet some of these challenges.

AB  - This paper proposes a measurement framework that explicitly accounts for the role of natural capital in productivity measurement. It is applied to aggregate economy data from the OECD Productivity Database, with natural capital data from the World Bank. It is shown that the direction of the adjustment to productivity growth depends on the rate of change of natural capital extraction relative to the rate of change of other inputs. The extended framework also makes the contribution of natural capital to economic growth explicit. This can be useful for countries relying on non-renewable resources to better understand the need to develop other sources of growth-human or productive capital-to prepare for times of scarcer resource endowments. The framework can readily be applied to more encompassing natural capital data, once it becomes available.

AB  - The present paper proposes a micro-econometric methodology for the economic valuation of the impact of ecosystem services in selected economic sectors. In the context of natural capital and ecosystem accounting, we built a four steps valuation protocol. The methodology is applied to the valuation of freshwater in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forestry Corridor (CAZ), Madagascar - a country partner with the Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES). Our results corroborate the intuition that understanding the value of water in its alternative uses is a key to fostering informed debate on water management and allocation in the CAZ area. More generally, this study provides a solid contribution towards a more effective way to elicit and record nature's ecosystem services contribution to the economy.

AB  - Natural capital is an asset that provides natural resource inputs and environmental services for economic production. Regional patterns of production and consumption have direct and indirect effects on sustainability of its natural capital. Traditional gross domestic product (GDP) estimates fail to explicitly and fully account for natural capital in system of national accounts (SNA). To address this gap, this study builds on United Nation's System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) and provides a methodological framework to integrate natural capital into system of national accounts, in input-output table. It further illustrates how natural capital integrated system of national accounts in input-output table can be used as an effective tool for natural resource management and policy analysis in computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling framework. Results indicate that, without natural capital accounting and integration into system of national accounts, GDP estimates may give misleading signals as a measure of a region's economic performance, where economic growth could be at the expense of natural capital depletion.

AB  - The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a detailed dashboard of goals, targets and indicators. In this paper we investigate alternative methods to relate the SDGs to overall measures of sustainable wellbeing that can motivate and guide the process of global societal change. We describe what a Sustainable Wellbeing Index (SWI) that connects with and complements the SDG dashboard might look like. We first investigate several options for how to construct such an index and then discuss what is needed to build consensus around it. Finally, we propose linking the SDGs and our SWI with a comprehensive systems dynamics model that can track stocks and flows and make projections into the future under different policy scenarios.

AB  - Temporal dimensions are highly relevant to the analysis of ecosystem services and their economic value. In this paper, we provide a framework that can be used for analyzing temporal dimensions of ecosystem services, we present a case study including an analysis of the supply of three ecosystem services in a Dutch national park, the Hoge Veluwe, over a time span of around a century, and we analyze the implications of temporal scales for ecosystem services analysis and valuation and ecosystem management. Our paper shows there can be major shifts in the values attributed to specific ecosystem services at time scales of decades or less. Changes in values at these time scales and are not commonly included in cost benefit analysis of ecosystem management options or natural capital accounts. Yet - given the long time lapse with which ecosystems may respond to management - these changes are highly relevant. We argue that ecosystem managers using cost benefit analysis should be aware of both uncertainties and of temporal changes in ecosystem values, and - to deal with unexpected changes in ecosystem services values - consider management strategies that target multiple ecosystem services.

AB  - In response to ecosystem degradation from rapid economic development, China began investing heavily in protecting and restoring natural capital starting in 2000. We report on China's first national ecosystem assessment (2000-2010), designed to quantify and help manage change in ecosystem services, including food production, carbon sequestration, soil retention, sandstorm prevention, water retention, flood mitigation, and provision of habitat for biodiversity. Overall, ecosystem services improved from 2000 to 2010, apart from habitat provision. China's national conservation policies contributed significantly to the increases in those ecosystem services.

AB  - Ecosystem accounting has been proposed as a comprehensive, innovative approach to natural capital accounting, and basically involves the biophysical and monetary analysis of ecosystem services in a national accounting framework. Characteristic for ecosystem accounting is the spatial approach taken to analyzing ecosystem services. This study examines how ecosystem services can be valued and mapped, and presents a case study for Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Four provisioning services (timber, palm oil, rattan, and paddy rice), one regulating service (carbon sequestration), and two cultural services (nature recreation, and wildlife habitat) are valued and mapped in a way that allows integration with national accounts. Two valuation approaches consistent with accounting are applied: the resource rent and cost-based approaches.

AB  - Green growth, or environmentally sustainable economic growth, is imperative in light of current environmental crises and resource depletion. Green indicators and statistics can measure environmentally sustainable development; they thus enable evaluating green growth and support its integration into policy. As such, this study uses an OECD framework to select a set of 12 indicators, designed for cross-country comparisons of green growth strategies. These indicators are assessed for 30 countries, including South Korea. Current data for each international indicator is compared to the 10th percentile of OECD countries and evaluated on a scale of 1-10. South Korea ranked 17th among the 30: its natural capital and quality of life indexes are relatively high, but its economic activity scores (production, consumption, and trade) are relatively low. These findings suggest that production and consumption processes must be made more environmentally and economically sustainable. Given that South Korea's green growth strategy currently emphasizes economic value, the country is moving in the right direction and our analysis projects that economic activity scores will rise in the future. This study offers a novel tool for measuring overall effects of green growth strategies, providing the information necessary to re-shape national economic plans based on current circumstances.

AB  - The current model of economic growth generated unprecedented increases in human wealth and prosperity during the 19th and 20th centuries. The main mechanisms have been the rapid pace of technological and social innovation, human capital accumulation, and the conversion of resources and natural capital into more valuable forms of produced capital. However, there is evidence emerging that this model may be approaching environmental limits and planetary boundaries, and that the conversion of natural capital needs to slow down rapidly and then be reversed. Some commentators have asserted that in order for this to occur, we will need to stop growing altogether and, instead, seek prosperity without growth. Others argue that environmental concerns are low-priority luxuries to be contemplated once global growth has properly returned to levels observed prior to the 2008 financial crisis. A third group argues that there is no trade-off, and, instead, promotes green growth: the (politically appealing) idea is that we can simultaneously grow and address our environmental problems. This paper provides a critical perspective on this debate and suggests that a substantial research agenda is required to come to grips with these challenges. One place to start is with the relevant metrics: measures of per-capita wealth, and, eventually, quantitative measures of prosperity, alongside a dashboard of other sustainability indicators. A public and political focus on wealth (a stock), and its annual changes, could realistically complement the current focus on market-based gross output as measured by GDP (a flow). This could have important policy implications, but deeper changes to governance and business models will be required.

AB  - Uncontrollable events such as adverse weather and volatile prices present considerable risks for arable farmers. Soil natural capital, which views the capacity of soil biodiversity to generate ecosystem services as a component of farm capital, could be important for the stability and resilience of arable production systems. We investigate therefore whether managing soil natural capital could be an effective strategy for mitigating future agricultural risks. We do this by constructing a dynamic stochastic portfolio model to optimize the stock of soil organic carbon (SOC)-our indicator of soil natural capital-when considering both the risks and returns from farming. SOC is controlled via the spatial and temporal allocation of cash crops and an illustrative replenishing land use. We find that higher soil natural capital buffers yield variance against adverse weather and reduces reliance on external inputs. Managing soil natural capital has therefore the potential to mitigate two serious agricultural risks: energy price shocks and adverse weather events, both of which are likely to be exacerbated in the future due to, e.g., globalization and climate change.

AB  - Small islands present both exceptional biodiversity and higher vulnerability. Their isolation has been identified as the main driver contributing to preserve the unique natural capital (10 of the 34 terrestrial biodiversity hotspots listed by Conservation International are wholly comprised of islands). However, small-island archipelagos may present a great variability among islands in terms of size and population, remoteness, incomes, natural and cultural landscapes, human pressures and vulnerabilities to global changes. This inexorably leads to different values, life-styles, and land use forms, which combine to shape cultural and socio-economic relationships of archipelagos, creating inter- and intra- island networks. Therefore, exploring inter- and intra-island relationships (based on historical, geographical, political and economic factors) can support a better understanding of networks and scale-dependent processes (ecological, economic, political, etc.), facilitating a more effective implementation of sustainable and biodiversity conservation policies at different levels. In this contribution, we present a multi-scale analyse to support the implementation of a regional conservation policy in a small-island archipelago (The Azores, Portugal). It represents a decision-making challenge for biodiversity conservation where a new management system of Protected Areas (PAs) was recently adopted. Three spatial units are considered: archipelago, island groups and island per se. The analysis integrates qualitative information, quantitative indicators and land use analyses in order to identify key areas of concern and relevant challenges for implementing the regional conservation policy at multiple levels. Findings underlined the importance to provide appropriate arrangements to better deal with scale mismatches arising from the divergence between spatial scale (where conservation challenges are identified) and administrative levels (where management interventions can be made).

AB  - The paper sets out a pragmatic case for preserving the aggregate level of natural capital, in the face of the declines in biodiversity and the rising population, and major increases in consumption that economic growth will bring in this century. The accounting framework to achieving this objective is considered, focused on the role of asset registers. Particular attention is paid to renewable assets at risk of falling below critical thresholds. These assets are key components of the balance sheet. Capital maintenance expenditures are required to maintain the value of assets intact, since renewable natural assets should not be depreciated, but rather treated as assets in perpetuity. Within the aggregate, substitutions with other forms of capital are permitted, but only if there is compensation for any detriment to natural capital. Offsetting is one mechanism for achieving this compensation. The case for enhancing the aggregate is considered, and the paper shows how a broader national plan over a generation could contribute to the policy objective of leaving the next generation with a richer endowment of natural capital. The policy instruments for embedding natural capital into public policy are reviewed.

AB  - The concept of sustainability implies a long-term relationship between human been and nature. Sustainable production systems are those systems capable of remaining in the time since they promote the conservation of natural resources, social capital and generate enough economic rents to support themselves. Growing vine and wine activities in Mendoza (Argentina) provide numerous benefits to the agricultural sector which is responsible for the use and pollution of natural resources. There are several indicators that show information of the viticulture sector, but most of them focus on physical and economic aspects. This work consists in the selection of indicators based on the theoretical concept of sustainability that request to integrate the three system's dimensions: economic, social and environmental. This was applied to the viticulture sector in Mendoza, therefore indicators were designed which are able to characterize it following the concept of sustainability. The selected indicators resulted appropriate to describe the grade of sustainability in every dimension (social, economic and environmental) aspects and were easy to obtain and to understand.

AB  - On top of significant improvements and progress made through science and engineering in the last century to increase efficiency and reduce impacts of mining to the environment, risk assessment has an important role to play in further reducing such impacts and preventing and mitigating risks. This paper reflects on how risk assessment can improve planning, monitoring and management in mining and mineral processing operations focusing on the importance of better understanding source-pathway-receptor linkages for all stages of mining. However, in light of the ever-growing consumption and demand for raw materials from mining, the need to manage environmental resources more sustainably is becoming increasingly important. The paper therefore assesses how mining can form an integral part of wider sustainable resources management, with the need for re-assessing the potential of mining in the context of sustainable management of natural capital, and with a renewed focus on its the role from a systems perspective. The need for understanding demand and pressure on resources, followed by appropriate pricing that is inclusive of all environmental costs, with new opportunities for mining in the wastes we generate, is also discussed. Findings demonstrate the need for a life cycle perspective in closing the loop between mining, production, consumption and waste generation as the way forward.

AB  - Making nature's value visible to humans is a key issue for the XXI century and it is crucial to identify and measure natural capital to incorporate benefits or costs of changes in ecosystem services into policy. Emergy analysis, a method able to analyze the overall functioning of a system, was applied to reckon the value of main ecosystem services provided by Posidonia oceanica, a fragile and precious Mediterranean seagrass ecosystem. Estimates, based on calculation of resources employed by nature, resulted in a value of 172 (sic) m(2) a(-1). Sediment retained by meadow is most relevant input, composing almost the whole P. oceanica value. Remarks about economic losses arising from meadow regression have been made through a time-comparison of meadow maps. Suggested procedure represents an operative tool to provide a synthetic monetary measure of ecosystem services to be employed when comparing natural capital to human and financial capitals in a substitutability perspective.

AB  - A variety of global metrics indicate the Earth has overshot its capacity to supply source and sink resources without substantial negative feedback. Here the relationship between consumption indicators (oil, freshwater, vehicle and meat consumption, GDP, emissions) and well-being is analysed latitudinally across 189 countries and longitudinally over 60 years within three affluent countries. All latitudinal analyses show the characteristic "consumption cliff and affluent uplands" shape: e.g. at low per capita GDP, life satisfaction increases sharply up the cliff with rising GDP; after a threshold, well-being is independent of GDP across the affluent uplands. Longitudinal analyses of Japan, UK and USA since the 1950s show per capita GDP has grown between 3- and 8-fold, but mean levels of well-being remained unchanged. Consumption patterns are now converging on those typical in affluent countries. Indicators for seven baskets of countries: Affluent North America-Europe-Oceania, Affluent Asia, fast developing BRICs and CIVETS, high income Resource Extractors, Poor with Green Peaks, and the Poorest show the factors of consumption between the poorest and affluent (5- to 100-fold) and the fast developing and affluent (2- to 10-fold). A finite planet cannot resource such convergence. One indicator, climate change, grows more of a concern as evidence emerges, yet denial remains strong. A priority is to create opportunities for divergent ways of living. Although material culture has been sought as the means to meet personal well-being, it has failed both the affluent and poorest. A green economy will require human attachments to both place and possessions, thus reducing disposal and damage. Such entanglement produces high affiliation that improves life satisfaction, as does much non-material consumption. As yet, most political and economic systems are far from recognising these imperatives, though there have been notable policy innovations. A shift to a green economy is inevitable. It is simply whether it occurs before or after the world becomes locked into severe climate change and other consequences of harm to natural capital.

AB  - There is currently, widespread interest in the assessment of ecosystem services, and the new insights that the concept provides in understanding the ecology of landscapes and the science of sustainability. Three major assessment frameworks can be identified in the contemporary literature, namely one based on habitats, one based on the identification of the system elements that delivers the service, and one based on the understanding of places. Although all are useful for supporting decision making in relation to sustainable development, different situations require different perspectives, and so it is important to understand their advantages and drawbacks. Moreover, it is important to determine how they relate to other approaches used, for example, in landscape planning, so that the contribution that ecosystem assessments can make to sustainability debates can be better understood. The aim of this paper is to describe the strengths of the place-based approach because it is more easily overlooked as an assessment option. In particular we will argue that a place-based approach can help us better understand issues of multi-functionality, the valuation of natural capital and the role of landscape in framing debates about ecosystem services and sustainability. An appreciation of these issues will enable researchers interested in landscape to key questions and priorities in relation to questions of sustainability. Although it is useful to consider different assessment perspectives separately, we conclude that in practice, the habitat and systems approaches can form part of a place-based assessment, just as a better understanding of place can enrich assessments that spring from these more natural science approaches. Nevertheless, in designing analytical strategies to take the ecosystem approach forward, we suggest that it is vital to consider these different perspectives in order to build assessments that are relevant, legitimate and credible, and which can effectively address the problems of sustainability that emerge at the landscape scale.

AB  - Biodiversity is complex, difficult to define, difficult to measure, and often involves international and intergenerational considerations. Biodiversity loss presents significant economic challenges. A great deal of economics is required to understand the issues, but a simple and important observation is that most species and ecosystems are not traded in markets, so prices are often absent and biodiversity is under-provided. Despite the formidable obstacles to high-quality economic analysis, economics has plenty to offer to biodiversity policy. First, economic valuation techniques can be employed to roughly estimate the value of the benefits provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. Second, assessing the ooptimum' amount of biodiversity involves recognizing that the conversion of natural capital into manufactured and human capital has so far generated vast amounts of wealth. While there may have been otoo much biodiversity' in the past, economic analysis suggests that this is a difficult position to hold now. Third, econometric techniques and carefully designed policy studies can assist in determining what policies are most suited to different contexts to cost-effectively reduce biodiversity loss. Fourth, political economy is helpful because international coordination is often requiredecosystems do not respect national borders and many biodiverse ecosystems are in poorer countries. This paper synthesizes the issues and proposes a research agenda, which includes improving the measurement and accounting of natural capital, improving valuation techniques and theory to provide greater guidance as to the ooptimum' biodiversity, and developing our understanding of the merits of different alternatives for government intervention to reduce biodiversity loss.

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - Soil is part of the Earth's life support system, but how should we convey the value of this and of soil as a resource? Consideration of the ecosystem services and natural capital of soils offers a framework going beyond performance indicators of soil health and quality, and recognizes the broad value that soil contributes to human wellbeing. This approach provides links and synergies between soil science and other disciplines such as ecology, hydrology, and economics, recognizing the importance of soils alongside other natural resources in sustaining the functioning of the Earth system. We articulate why an ecosystems approach is important for soil science in the context of natural capital, ecosystem services, and soil change. Soil change is defined as change on anthropogenic time scales and is an important way of conveying dynamic changes occurring in soils that are relevant to current political decision-making time scales. We identify four important areas of research: (i) framework development; (ii) quantifying the soil resource, stocks, fluxes, transformations, and identifying indicators; (iii) valuing the soil resource for its ecosystem services; and (iv) developing decision-support tools. Furthermore, we propose contributions that soil science can make to address these research challenges.

AB  - In the last decades several indicators have been proposed to guide decision makers and help manage natural capital. Among such indicators is the Ecological Footprint, a resource accounting tool with a biophysical and thermodynamic basis. In our recent paper (Niccolucci et al., 2009), a three dimensional Ecological Footprint ((EF)-E-3D) model was proposed to better explain the difference between human demand for natural capital stocks and resource flows. Such (EF)-E-3D model has two relevant dimensions: the surface area (or Footprint size - EFsize) and the height (or Footprint depth - EFdepth). EFsize accounts for the human appropriation of the annual income from natural capital while EFdepth accounts for the depletion of stocks of natural capital and/or the accumulation of stocks of wastes. Building on the 2009 Edition of the National Footprint Accounts (NFA), global trends (from 1961 to 2006) for both EFsize and EFdepth were analyzed. EFsize doubled from 1961 to 1986; after 1986 it reached an asymptotic value equal to the Earth's biocapacity (BC) and remained constant. Conversely, EFdepth remained constant at the "natural depth" value until 1986, the year in which global EF first exceeded Earth's BC. A growing trend was observed after that. Trends in each Footprint land type were also analyzed to better appraise the land type under the higher human induced stress. The usefulness of adopting such (EF)-E-3D model in the National Footprint Accounts was also discussed. In comparing any nation's demand for ecological assets with its own biocapacity in a given year, four hypothetical cases were identified which could serve as the basis for a new Footprint geography based on both size and depth concepts. This (EF)-E-3D model could help distinguish between the use of natural capital flows and the depletion of natural capital stocks while maintaining the structure and advantages of the classical Ecological Footprint formulation.

AB  - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimates that between 60,000 and 100,000 plant species are threatened with extinction-equivalent to around one-quarter of the total number of known plant species. Why should we care? There are a number of reasons. The first is that these plants may be useful to us in unknown ways. Secondly, ecology has taught us that resilience is found in diversity. Thirdly, we should be saving plant species from extinction because we can-there is no technological reason why any plant species should become extinct. Where we can't protect and manage plant diversity in situ, we should be employing ex situ conservation techniques, ranging from seed banks to habitat restoration. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment describes such interventions as 'techno-gardening'. This is not an abstract concept-it is already a reality in the majority of man-managed landscapes. In this context the perception of ex situ conservation as simply a back-up strategy for in situ conservation is mistaken. We are all involved in ex situ conservation to some degree, from cultivating our back gardens, to farming, to management of protected areas. Ex situ conservation should be seen as a complementary approach to in situ conservation and on the same spectrum. Kew's Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, comprising more than 120 plant science institutions in 50 countries, epitomizes this philosophy in action. We work actively on every seed collection we bank, finding out how useful it is and how we can grow it to enable human innovation, adaptation and resilience. Challenges remain at the policy level; for example, the need to factor-in the value of natural capital to development decision making, and better defining a role for public-sector science. At the technical level, also, there is much to do. Perhaps the greatest technical challenges relate to the restoration and management of complex, self-sustaining habitats or species assemblages. If we are to techno-garden effectively, in order to maintain ecosystem services and sustain biodiversity, then a multidisciplinary approach will be required. Many plant science institutions have recognized this and are becoming engaged increasingly in restoration activities and in situ management. Ultimately, humanity's ability to innovate and adapt is dependent on our having access to the full range of plant species and the alleles they contain.

AB  - The assessment of sustainable development is a challenging task as its measuring is rather complex without a mature framework. In this paper, as a case study, a coastal city of China-Yantai was assessed for sustainable development in the period from 1998 to 2007. We used a methodological framework based on 36 indicators and three composite indices from the dimensions of environment, economy and society subsystems. The assessment results indicated that Yantai was almost in the potentially unsustainable development or intermediate sustainable development, except in 1998 and in 2007. Accordingly, the progress of sustainable development was divided into two stages in the light of the relative changes of three subsystems. Some relevant issues, such as natural capital, GPI vs. GDP in sustainable development assessment were discussed. Finally, an uncertainty analysis was also given in the assessment. In conclusion, the sustainable development in Yantai had experienced a shift from environment-based to social-economic-based in the past 10 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two ISO-compliant approaches on modelling the recycling of plastics and metals are frequently applied in life cycle assessment case studies and intensively debated: the recycled content or cutoff approach and the end of life recycling or avoided burden approach. This paper discusses the two approaches from three different perspectives: (1) the kind of sustainability concept served, (2) the risk perception involved and (3) the eco-efficiency indicators resulting from the two approaches.
   The analysis shows that the recycled content approach serves the strong sustainability concept. It is based on a risk-averse attitude and results in higher eco-efficiency of metal scrap recycling as compared to primary metal manufacture. The end of life recycling approach serves the weak sustainability concept (losses in natural capital can be compensated by man-made capital). It corresponds to a risk-seeking attitude and results in higher eco-efficiency of primary metal manufacture as compared to secondary metal production.
   It is concluded that a harmonisation of the approaches is hardly possible due to the value choices involved. It is the task of (private and public) life cycle assessment commissioners to decide on the appropriate modelling approach. National authorities may have a rather long-term and risk-averse perspective, whilst industries may prefer a short-term perspective leading them to select the recycled content and end of life recycling approach, respectively. Life cycle inventory databases need to be flexible to serve such opposing perspectives and to enable practitioners to adapt the modelling approaches according to the needs of the commissioner.

AB  - In this paper, I formalize the idea of sustainable development in terms of intergenerational wellbeing. I then sketch an argument that has recently been put forward formally to demonstrate that intergenerational well-being increases over time if and only if a comprehensive measure of wealth per capita increases. The measure of wealth includes not only manufactured capital, knowledge and human capital (education and health), but also natural capital (e.g. ecosystems). I show that a country's comprehensive wealth per capita can decline even while gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increases and the UN Human Development Index records an improvement. I then use some rough and ready data from the world's poorest countries and regions to show that during the period 1970-2000 wealth per capita declined in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, even though the Human Development Index (HDI) showed an improvement everywhere and GDP per capita increased in all places (except in sub-Saharan Africa, where there was a slight decline). I conclude that, as none of the development indicators currently in use is able to reveal whether development has been, or is expected to be, sustainable, national statistical offices and international organizations should now routinely estimate the (comprehensive) wealth of nations.

AB  - The water footprint concept introduced in 2002 is an analogue of the ecological footprint concept originating from the 1990s. Whereas the ecological footprint (EF) denotes the bioproductive area (hectares) needed to sustain a population, the water footprint (WF) represents the freshwater volume (cubic metres per year) required. In elaborating the WF concept into a well-defined quantifiable indicator, a number of methodological issues have been addressed, with many similarities to the methodological concerns in EF analysis. The methodology followed in WF studies is in most cases analogous to the methodology taken in EF studies, but deviates at some points. Well-reasoned it has been chosen for instance to specifically take into account the source and production circumstances of products and assess the actual water use involved, thus not taking global averages. As a result one can exactly localise the spatial distribution of a water footprint of a country. With respect to the outcome of the footprint estimates, one can see both similarities and striking differences. Food consumption for instance contributes significantly to both the EF and the WF, but mobility (and associated energy use) is very important only for the EF. From a sustainability perspective, the WF of a country tells another story and thus at times will put particular development strategies in a different perspective. The paper reviews and compares the methodologies in EF and WF studies, compares nation's footprint estimates and suggests how the two concepts can be interpreted in relation to one another. The key conclusion is that the two concepts are to be regarded as complementary in the sustainability debate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past decade, efforts to value and protect ecosystem services have been promoted by many as the last, best hope for making conservation mainstream - attractive and commonplace worldwide. In theory, if we can help individuals and institutions to recognize the value of nature, then this should greatly increase investments in conservation, while at the same time fostering human well-being. In practice, however, we have not yet developed the scientific basis, nor the policy and finance mechanisms, for incorporating natural capital into resource- and land-use decisions on a large scale. Here, we propose a conceptual framework and sketch out a strategic plan for delivering on the promise of ecosystem services, drawing on emerging examples from Hawai'i. We describe key advances in the science and practice of accounting for natural capital in the decisions of individuals, communities, corporations, and governments.

AB  - Sustainable development is concerned with how current decisions about how to manage a portfolio of wealth - comprising all of the assets in an economy including natural wealth - have an impact upon future well-being. Contributions to this debate based on the link between asset accounting and indicators of sustainable development are reviewed. This 'capital approach' focuses on wealth accounting and indicators of genuine (or adjusted net) saving, the amount of saving over and above the value of total asset consumption. If the genuine saving rate is negative, it provides an indication that current behaviour is eroding the capital on which its development depends. Such empirical discussion about the sustainability of development paths is typically concerned with assessing whether national economies are sustainable. However, as demonstrated, for example, by Pearce in 2003, these insights and the indicators that follow are also relevant for discussions about the contribution of economic sectors such as construction and the built environment to sustainability. This provides a useful addition to existing approaches (such as those based on a 'triple-bottom line'). The paper concludes with some thoughts about how the capital (or wealth-accounting) approach could be extended to gain further insight into the contribution of the built environment to sustainability.

AB  - Early concern by economists for the effect of natural capital on economic growth gave way to complacency and neglect during the nineteenth century. Evidence has emerged, however, that since the 1960s the economic performance of low-income countries has been inversely related to their natural resource wealth. This relationship is not a deterministic one so policy counts. SEEA can help improve the policy and performance of resource-abundant low-income countries by reinforcing the rationale for the sound management of natural resources and also by providing an index of policy sustainability in the form of the net saving rate. This policy index, along with other measures such as a capital fund for sterilizing the rent, initiatives to increase the transparency of rent flows and the rigorous evaluation of alternative uses of additional public sector revenue can improve the efficiency by which natural resource rent is transformed into alternative forms of capital to sustain rising social welfare. Chad and Mauritania provide case studies to illustrate how SEEA and net saving can be used to diagnose policy failure and improve economic performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - AUSTRALIA
AB  - In Australia an unprecedented level of attention is being paid to improving the sustainable management of agricultural lands. As of 2005, the Australian government had committed over four billion dollars to land, water and biodiversity management programmes. Most is being allocated to regional community groups. Central to programme delivery is attention to community capacity and the desire to build capacity to implement changes in land and water management. This paper addresses the fundamentally important question 'what is community capacity?' through developing and refining a conceptual model of community capacity to deliver biodiversity conservation outcomes. Model development was based on a literature review and synthesis, with subsequent refinement using interviews. From the literature, community capacity was described as five forms of capital: natural, social, human, institutional and produced economic. The model was refined using interviews with Greening Australia (an environmental non-government organisation) field staff. Their responses identified all five forms of capital as important elements of community capacity. Social and human capital were mentioned by almost all respondents, with limited mention being made of the other capitals. Social capital included cognitive and structural dimensions. Knowledge, skills and experience were part of human capital. These results provide researchers and practitioners with assurance that social and human capital indicators can be confidently sought to describe capacity. There is also sufficient guidance from these results to progress indicator selection for the remaining forms of capital provided that selection is accompanied by continuing refinement of our descriptions of these forms.

AB  - This paper presents a methodological synthesis of two congruent approaches into a common landscape change trajectory analysis and the assessment of landscape dynamics and sustainability. The emphasis of the analysis is on the retrospective relationship between the past and the present-day landscape patterns and associated key biotopes. The example key biotopes, oak woodlands and grasslands, represent valuable habitats in the hermboreal landscapes of Finland and Sweden. The paper presents a conceptual stepwise approach for change trajectory analysis utilising multiple spatio-temporal data and techniques available in image processing and geographical information systems (GIS) including the following steps: (I) specification of spatio-temporal data and their representation of target objects, (II) the choice of direct or indirect change trajectory analysis, (III) hierarchical structuring of landscape information, (IV) compilation of landscape information into a GIS database, and (V) identification of paths for landscape change trajectory analysis. In this case study, we have focused on three interlinked trajectory analysis approaches, and their role in the assessment of landscape sustainability from a potential biodiversity perspective. We conclude that proposed landscape change trajectory analysis can improve the assessment of the key biotopes as well as present-day landscape characteristics, in maintaining biodiversity and related ecological values by providing information on landscape stability, continuity, change processes and boundary dynamics. This approach can be useful in the assessment of natural capital, but requires data-specific and context sensitive data processing and analysis solutions. The results should be interpreted as an approximation and generalisation of the spatio-temporal complexity of landscape reality and therefore be used in conjunction with additional habitat function measures.

AB  - As an economy grows, natural capital such as timber, soil, and water is reallocated to the human economy. This conflict between economic growth and biodiversity conservation creates a conundrum for conservation biologists because traditional forms of conservation action require money. We hypothesize that conservation spending in the United States is highly correlated with income and wealth, and we tested whether selected proxies for U.S. conservation activity could be predicted by U.S. economic indicators over time scales of 7-71 years. Stock market indexes (Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor's 500 Index), gross domestic product (GDP), and personal income (PI) explained as much as 99% of annual variation in total revenue (including contributions) to four large nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the World Wildlife Fund, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, The Nature Conservancy. These broad economic indicators also explained as much as 96% of the annual number of university conservation programs, 83% of membership in professional conservation organizations (Natural Areas Association, Society for Conservation Biology), 93% of natural park visitation, and 99+% of national park acreage. In most analyses, the income variables GDP and PI explained more variation in conservation activity than did either of the stock-market wealth variables. After long-term growth was removed from the time series, changes in revenues to the four NGOs combined were significantly correlated with GDP but not PI over the short term. Short-term variation in park acreage was significantly correlated with GDP and PI but lagged both by 3 years. Using linear models based on GDP, we predicted increases of 2.3% in 2003 cumulative NGO revenues and 1.0% in 2006 acreage owned by the National Park Service. The conservation activity parameters we measured may exhibit positive trends even in the face of declining biodiversity, but biodiversity conservation will ultimately require the cessation of economic growth. The challenge to the conservation biology community is to retain a significant presence during and after the cessation of growth.

AB  - The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a version of the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW), is a significantly more comprehensive approach to assessing economic progress than conventional measures like gross domestic product (GDP). GPI adjusts for income distribution effects, the value of household and volunteer work, costs of mobility and pollution, and the depletion of social and natural capital. 1SEW or GPI have been estimated for several countries around the world and a few Canadian provinces, but we report here on the first multi-scale application at the city, county and state levels in Vermont, USA. We show that it is feasible to apply the GPI approach at these smaller scales and to compare across scales and with the national average. Data limitations and problems still exist, but potential solutions to these problems also exist. All three Vermont scales had significantly higher GPI per capita since 1980 than the national average, indicating the major differences that can exist within countries. The GPI per capita for all Vermont scales was similar to the national average in the 1950-1980 period, but more than twice the national average by 2000. The main factors explaining this difference had to do with Vermont's much better environmental performance than the national average in the post-1980 period. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Theoretical work has demonstrated that sustainable development requires nondeclining per capita wealth, where wealth is defined to include produced, natural, human and social capital. Several studies have attempted to measure total national wealth or changes in wealth, but have been seriously hampered by a lack of data, especially for natural and human capital. To address this problem, the UN and other international statistical agencies developed a standardized framework for environmental accounts, the System of integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA). Using the newly available asset accounts for natural capital, national wealth accounts are constructed and used to assess the contrasting development paths of Botswana and Namibia. Botswana, with an explicit policy of reinvestment of resource rents, has roughly tripled per capita wealth and national income over the past two decades. Namibia, with no explicit policy to use natural capita to build wealth, has seen per capita wealth and income decline.

AB  - The Guanabara Bay basin, SE Brazil, is shown as an experimental site to evaluate development and sustainability in coastal areas. We developed a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework in a practical context to integrate natural and socio-economic indicators. Sustainability reflects public policies towards the utilization of natural resources. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) included in DPSIR evaluates losses and benefits resulting from such policies. CBA has some limitations due to the difficulty of valuating environmental goods and services. Instead of valuating them we propose to combine sustainability indicators and defensive expenditures for the implementation of public policies. This approach agrees with the environmental conservation paradigm implicit in sustainable development. It allows an estimation of the physical natural capital depreciation (PNCD), by using it to correct the gross domestic product (GDP) of the study area, and demonstrating the present non-sustainable characteristics of the current policies applied to the area.

AB  - This paper estimates the true economic income for the Chilean mining sector, using the welfare foundations for the usual net domestic product (NDP) income measure of the traditional National Accounts System (NAS) provided by [Weitzman, M., 1976. On the welfare significance of national product in a dynamic economy. Quarterly Journal of Economics. 90, 156-162; Weitzman, M., 2000. The linearised Hamiltonian as comprehensible NDP. Environment and Development Economics. 5, 55-68]. The total depletion of natural capital caused by mining is calculated by estimating, on the one hand, the depreciation of resources (using the net price approach) and, on the other, the environmental costs provoked by mining activity. The results show that, correcting the usual GDP measure for man-made capital depreciation plus the total loss of natural capital, the standard mining GDP measure of the NAS overestimates by 31-36% the economic income generated by Chile's mining sector during the period 1985-1996.

AB  - This paper explores how the quality of environmental assessment could be improved by using the concept of natural capital. The issues are examined by reference to golf course developments in the area between Freiburg, Germany and Basel, Switzerland. The paper evaluates the site-level environmental impact assessments statements that were undertaken prior to these developments and the related decision-making processes. The case study illustrates many of the shortcomings apparent in the EIA process when undertaken at local scales. However, it is also evident that even if such exercises had been more rigorous at the outset, they would still have been of limited value for assessing consequences in relation to policies for sustainable development. On the one hand, the nature and scale of impacts is highly dependent on subsequent management, which is often not considered during the EIA process and subsequently lies outside the regulation process. A further limitation of the assessment is that it does not take account of the consequences of the economic failure of the project, and the implications this may have for the long-term sustainable development of the area. In order to find ways to remedy these deficiencies in planning for sustainable development this paper considers how the concept of natural capital might be used to develop a more strategic focus when assessing proposals. The paper explores a particular formulation of the natural capital concept, namely the UKs Quality of Life Capital (QoLC) approach, and concludes by considering these ideas in relation to the 'Leitbild' concept, which is now being widely debated in the German-speaking literature. It is argued that these concepts taken together offer the basis for a more integrated and strategic assessment of development proposals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental accounts bring together economic and environmental information in a common framework to measure the contribution of the environment to the economy and the impact of the economy on the environment. They enable governments to set priorities, monitor economic policies more precisely, enact more effective environmental regulations and resource management strategies, and design more efficient market instruments for environmental policies. This article uses examples from the regional environmental accounting programme in southern Africa to demonstrate the usefulness of environmental accounts to policy-making and natural resource management. The examples address the contribution of natural capital endowments (minerals and fisheries) to sustainable development in Botswana and Namibia; the economic importance Of non-market forest goods and services in South Africa; and the socio-economic impact of current water allocation and pricing policies in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. While there are many additional policy applications, these few provide a powerful argument for the use of environmental accounts in all countries.

AB  - For some time now, ecological economists have been putting forward a 'threshold hypothesis'-the notion that when macroeconomic systems expand beyond a certain size, the additional cost of growth exceeds the flow of additional benefits. In order to support their belief, ecological economists have developed a number of similar indexes to measure and compare the benefits and costs of growth (e.g. the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare, ISEW, and the Genuine Progress Indicator, GPI). In virtually every instance where an index of this type has been calculated for a particular country, the movement of the index appears to reinforce the existence of the threshold hypothesis. Of late, a number of observers have cast doubt over the validity of these alternative indexes. One of the concerns commonly expressed is the supposed lack of a theoretical foundation to support the ISEW, the GPI, and other related indexes. By adopting a concept of income and capital outlined by Fisher (Nature of Capital and Income. A. M. Kelly, New York, 1906), this paper demonstrates that these alternative indexes are theoretically sound but, in order to be broadly accepted, require the continuous development of more robust valuation methods.

AB  - A natural resource accounting approach was applied in this study to evaluate the performance and sustainability of mining practices and strategies in South Africa (SA). The study showed that except for a brief period during the 1980s, rent capture was very low and almost all the resource rent from minerals dissipated to private companies, Recently, however. user costs have appeared to have been reasonably recovered by taxes and institutional royalties and the capital component of the rent (user cost) has fully been reinvested by mining companies. While adequate reinvestment of recovered user costs in alternative forms of capital might imply sustainable management, this can only hold under the assumptions of perfect substitution between human-made and natural capital of the weak sustainability (WS) paradigm. However., even if one adopts WS, the present analysis could not provide adequate evidence in support of the prudence of mining activities in the country. This is due to a lack of adequate information on the proportions of royalties and taxes reinvested collected by the government and private landowners. Moreover, the fact that this study does not account for the environmental impacts of mining is another important limitation on the ability of the present analysis to conclude that mineral resources have been prudently exploited in SA.

AB  - We propose an alternative explanation for the inverted U-shape relationship between income and environmental degradation. In developing countries, production and consumption patterns of (rural) households an the main cause of environmental damage. With a conventional household model, we demonstrate that the so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve may arise when the restrictive assumption of a set of perfect markets for factors and commodities is relaxed, Depending on the criterion or indicator that is used to represent environmental pressure, however, we demonstrate that the reverse may also hold. This finding highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate dependent variable in regression analyses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A wide variety of indicators suggest that humans are destroying the earth at a rapid rate. Forests, air, water, human health, and endangered species are all in trouble. Overall, humans are creating economic growth by depreciating the capital in natural resources that allows for that growth. We argue that the lens of organizational behavior yields insights not otherwise visible to explain this behavior. We provide a multilevel analysis of the destructiveness of taken-for-granted belief and behavior. We consider (1) how human perception of environmental problems is affected by cognitive biases; (2) how individuals are influenced in these biases by the organizations of which they are a part; and (3) how institutions persist that guide our awareness of our connections to the environment.

AB  - So far there is no unified rule on the incorporation of degradation of environmental capital into national income accounting procedure. Net national product is currently derived by deducting from gross product the depreciation of man-made capital only. Deducting depreciation of natural capital in national income can provide a better indicator of the 'green' net national product. The contribution of this paper is to show how one can use two methodologies in deriving 'green' net national product. This paper estimates the depreciation of forest resources in national accounts for China from 1976 to 1992. The procedure of calculation is described in the paper by valuing the changes of forest resources. Two alternative approaches are used: the net price approach and the user cost approach. By using the net price approach both physical and monetary accounts are computed to derive forest depreciation. In the user cost approach 0, 5 and 10% discount rates an used to derive the depreciation. Measuring sustainability is proceeded by the level of net investment. Both approaches show that the development of the forest sector is not sustainable due to the negative net investment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The ecological footprint: An indicator of progress toward regional sustainability
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT

CP  - 3rd Symposium on the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
AB  - We define regional sustainability as the continuous support of human quality of life within a region's ecological carrying capacity. To achieve regional sustainability, one must first assess the current situation. That is, indicators of status and progress are required. The ecological footprint is an area-based indicator which quantifies the intensity of human resource use and waste discharge activity in relation to a region's ecological carrying capacity. If the ecological footprint of a human population is greater than the area which it occupies, the population must be doing at least one of the following: receiving resources from elsewhere, disposing of some of its waste outside of the area, or depleting the area's natural capital stocks. To achieve global sustainability, the sum of all regional footprints must not exceed the total area of the biosphere. This paper explains the mechanics of a footprint calculation method for nations and regions. As the method is standardized, the relative ecological load imposed by nations and regions can be compared. Further, a nation's or region's consumption can be contrasted with its local ecological production, providing an indicator of potential vulnerability and contribution to ecological decline.

AB  - We appraise neoclassical theory of growth with natural capital for the estimation of indicators for sustainability. Relationships between four theoretically distinct measures are clarified: Hicksian "change in capital stock value"; the Hartwick "net savings" (which excludes capital gains); "sustainable national income" (SNI); and "environmentally-adjusted net national product" (gNNP). An overlapping generations (OLG) general equilibrium model with depletable natural capital demonstrates the significance of model parameters determining technical feasibility and intertemporal distribution of consumption. Irremediable uncertainties in model specification and empirical measurement mean that the neoclassical theory is not robust for defining or estimating indicators for sustainability.

AB  - Suggestions for defining and measuring sustainable development can broadly be placed in two categories: weak and strong sustainability. The concept of weak sustainability assumes that manufactured and natural capital are close substitutes, This means that the costs of environmental deterioration (e.g. groundwater damage) can be compensated by benefits from manufactured capital (e.g. income). Thus, environmental damage is valued in monetary units, The concept of strong sustainability denies the degree of substitution that weak sustainability assumes, at least for some critical elements of natural capital. This paper endorses the use of strong sustainability indicators, especially for critical loads and critical levels. These have to be pointed out by environmental scientists and/or geologists. Nevertheless, the costs and benefits of avoiding critical impacts have to be taken into consideration. Hence, a combination of strong and weak sustainability indicators is suggested.

AB  - Operationalization of the concept of sustainable development requires the formulation of sustainability indicators and of techniques to assess scores on such indicators. A flexible approach is proposed, which incorporates several normative issues (including intergenerational welfare and substitution of manufactured capital for natural capital) and leads to a choice of location-specific sustainability constraints. Key parameters include classes of environmental resources, threshold levels, spatial level and time path. Assessing the score on this sustainability indicator involves the measurement of the difference between actual and normative levels of resource use. Depending on the measurement scale at which information becomes available, multi-criteria analysis may be useful to arrive at overall sustainability scores.

AB  - Traditional measures of aggregate income do not accurately reflect welfare in an economy. In particular aggregate income fails to account for changes in marketed and non-marketed natural capital and its impact on economic welfare. If natural capital is theoretically equivalent to reproducible capital, then depreciation of the resource base should be deducted from net product as presently estimated. Revision of land use sector accounts for Great Britain is undertaken for carbon fixing potential of land use and the impact of other pollutants and the non-marketed aspects of land use.

AB  - The enzyme-linked receptor assay (ELRA) detects estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects at the molecular level of receptor binding and is a useful tool for the integrative assessment of ecotoxicological potentials caused by hormonally active agents (HAA) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC). The main advantage of the ELRA is its high sample throughput and its robustness against cytotoxicity and microbial contamination. After a methodological adaptation to salinity of the ELRA, according to the first part of this study, which increased its salinity tolerance and sensitivity for 17-beta-estradiol, the optimised ELRA was used to investigate 13 native sediments characterised by different levels of salinity and chemical contamination. The applicability of the ELRA for routine analysis in environmental assessment was evaluated. Salinity is often a critical factor for bioassays in ecotoxicological sediment assessment. Therefore, salinity of the samples was additionally adjusted to different levels to characterise its influence on elution and binding processes of receptor-binding substances.
   The ELRA was carried out with the human estrogen receptor alpha (ER) in a 96-well microplate format using the experimental setup known from the competitive immunoassay based on ligand-protein interaction. It is an important improvement that a physiologically relevant receptor was used as a linking protein instead of an antibody. The microplates were coated with a 17-beta-estradiol-BSA conjugate, and dilution series of estradiol and of native sediment samples were added and incubated with the ER. After a washing step, a biotinylated mouse anti-ER antibody was added to each well. Receptor binding to estradiol, agonistic and antagonistic receptor binding, were determined by a streptavidin-POD-biotin complex with subsequent measurement of the peroxidase activity at the wavelength of 450 nm using a commercial ELISA multiplate reader. The sediment elutriates and pore water samples of sediments were tested in a dilution series to evaluate at which dilution step the receptor-binding potential ends. In the elution process (see Section 2.1 to 2.2), a method was developed to adjust the salinity to the levels of the reference testings, which offers an appropriate option to adjust the salinity in both directions. Statistical evaluation was made with a combination of the Mann-Whitney U test and the pT-method.
   This part of the study characterised the environmental factor 'salinity' for prospective applications of the ELRA. Using reference substances such as 17-beta-estradiol, the ELRA showed sigmoid concentration-effect relations over a broad range from 0.05 mu g/l to 100 mu g/l under physiological conditions. After methodological optimisation, both sensitivity and tolerance of the assay against salinity could be significantly raised, and the ELRA became applicable under salinity conditions up to concentrations of 20.5aEuro degrees. The mean relative inter-test error (n = 3) was around 11% with reference substances and below 5% for single sediments elutriates in three replicates each. For sediment testings, the pore water and different salinity-adjusted elutriates of 13 sediments were used. A clear differentiation of the receptor-binding potential could be reached by application of the pT-method. Thereby, pT-values from one to six could be assigned to the sediments, and the deviation caused by the different salinity conditions was one pT-value. The mean standard deviation in the salinity adaptation procedure of the elutriates was below 5%.
   Although the ELRA has already been used for assessments of wastewater, sludge and soil, its applicability for samples to different salinity levels has not been investigated so far. Even if the ELRA is not as sensitive as the E-screen or the YES-assay, with regard to reference substances like 17-beta-estradiol, it is a very useful tool for pre-screening, because it is able to integrate both estrogenic as well as anti-estrogenic receptor-binding effects. According to the results of sediment testing, and given the integrative power to detect different directions of effects, the ELRA shows sufficient sensitivity and salinity tolerance to discriminate receptor-binding potentials in environmental samples.
   The optimised ELRA assay is a fast, cost-effective, reliable and highly reproducible tool that can be used for high-throughput screening in a microplate format in detecting both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects. Additionally, the ELRA is robust against microbial contaminations, and is not susceptible towards cytotoxic interferences like the common cell-culture methods. The general applicability and sufficient sensitivity of the ELRA was shown in freshwater environments. Marine and brackish samples can be measured up to salinity levels of 20.5aEuro degrees.
   In view of the proven sensitivity, functionality and the fastness of the ELRA, it is recommendable to standardise the test method. At the moment, no adequate in vitro test procedure exists which is standardised to DIN or ISO levels. The E-screen and the yeast estrogen/androgen screens (YES/YAS) sometimes underlie strong cytotoxic effects, as reported in the first part of this study. Further development of an ELRA assay using human androgen receptors appears to be very promising to gain information about androgenic and anti-androgenic effects, too. This would offer a possibility to use the ELRA as a fast and reliable pre-screening tool for the detection of endocrine potentials, thus minimising time and cost-expensive animal experiments.

AB  - The world population is expected to increase by a further three billion by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing countries that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 degrees C (0.65-1.06 degrees C) over the period of 1880-2012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record.
   Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6 degrees C, which is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term (2020-39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by 4.5-9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7% to 1.35% of GDP per year.
   Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders (<0.5 ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor.
   Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $ 7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population.
   However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented.
   Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices.
   CRA is a way to achieve short-and long-term agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are referred to as the "triple win" of overall CRA.
   The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from climate risks.
   The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation anywhere in the world.
   Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing the project at village level through farmers' participatory approach.
   To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health card-based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village CHC with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy. (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment of automated weather stations.
   Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of GHG emissions which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to global warming potential.
   These 151 CRVs are learning sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change mitigation mission in the country.

AB  - Urban water pollution has been well controlled by strict management in the past few decades in China. Thus, the central government started to place emphasis on rural water pollution, and increasing number of sewage treatment facilities have been constructed, and currently, they are operating in China. Therefore, thoroughly assessing the operating conditions and the performance of these facilities is important. This article analyzes life cycle assessment and life cycle cost to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of four common technologies to determine how the emerging rural sewage treatment facilities in China are running. The results showed that the plant-adopted anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process was an optimal scheme for lower environmental impact that was also cost-effective. All technologies had similar impacts on eleven environmental categories. Due to cement consumption during the construction phase and electricity consumption during the operation phase, the marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential was the greatest contributor, accounting for approximately 90% of the total potential impact. In addition, this research revealed that electricity consumption during the operation phase was responsible for almost all environmental impact categories, except for eutrophication potential and ozone layer depletion potential categories. Lastly, scenario analysis indicated that reusing treated water and adjusting power structure could be useful measures to promote the sustainable development of rural water environments.

AB  - The volumetric activity of the divalent Sr-90 ion in groundwater at the Chornobyl NPP industrial site ranges from 1 to 2 to 400-3800 Bq/l. The increase in groundwater radionuclides concentrations is associated with the reduced sorption properties of local sediments, which affect the migration capacity of radionuclides in the environment. The decrease of the Sr-90 sorption properties of sediments is caused by changes in the chemical composition of groundwater. A new statistical method has been performed. Method based on the Monte Carlo method in order to evaluate the correlations between the Sr-90 volumetric activity and the groundwater chemical composition components. Simulation results using this method suggest a correlation between the volumetric activity of Sr-90, the concentrations cations, the pH, and the oxidation index (organic contents). A direct correlation was established between the volumetric activity of Sr-90, Ca2+ concentrations and the pH of groundwater in the range from 7 to 12.4. It was revealed that the concentrations of Na+ and K+ do not affect the conditions of Sr-90 migration with groundwater. There is an inverse correlation between the concentration of Sr-90 and the oxidation index, which is an indirect indicator of the organic substances content in water. Thus, the presence of organic substances in the groundwater effectively promotes sorption of Sr-90. The proposed method of geochemical statistics enables a quantitative assessment of groundwater monitoring results.

AB  - Cities are recognised as key enablers for the world's sustainable future. Urban sprawl and inefficient use of land are important issues significantly impacting the provision and use of open green spaces. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.7.1 aims at globally monitoring the amount of land that is dedicated by cities for public space. In Europe, the indicator "Share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood" is supposed to correspond to the SDG11.7.1 but is currently on-hold due to methodological issues and lack of data. Moreover, to efficiently assess public space conditions, timely and spatially disaggregated information is essential but not yet widely adopted by urban practitioners. Hereafter, we use a combination of satellite and crowdsourced Earth Observations (EO) to model physical accessibility to urban green spaces in four European cities. Findings suggest that it is technically feasible to derive information on the share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology represents a consistent, valid, reliable, low-cost, timely and continuous source of information for sustainable urban development. Open and free EO data can be a good complement to enhance official and traditional statistics on urban areas facilitating EU reporting against the SDG indicator for better comparison between EU countries.

AB  - The soil microbial activity, biomass and structure were evaluated in an unamended (S) and organically amended soil treated with two commercial formulations of the herbicides chlorotoluron (Erturon(R)) and flufenacet plus diflufenican (Herold(R)) under field conditions. Soils were amended with spent mushroom substrate (SMS) or green compost (GC). Soil microbial dehydrogenase activity (DHA), biomass and structure determined by the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles were recorded at 0, 45, 145, 229 and 339 days after herbicide treatment. The soil DHA values steadily decreased over time in the unamended soil treated with the herbicides, while microbial activity was constant in the amended soils. The amended soils recorded higher values of concentrations of PLFAs. Total soil microbial biomass decreased over time regardless of the organic amendment or the herbicide. Herbicide application sharply decreased the microbial population, with a significant modification of the microbial structure in the unamended soil. In contrast, no significant differences in microbial biomass and structure were detected in S + SMS and S + GC, untreated or treated with herbicides. The application of SMS and GC led to a significant shift in the soil microbial community regardless of the herbicides. The use of SMS and GC as organic amendments had a certain buffer effect on soil DHA and microbial biomass and structure after herbicide application due to the higher adsorption capacity of herbicides by the amended soils.

AB  - This study was conducted on individuals of European perch from six reservoirs in Serbia with different properties, used for different purposes, and situated at different altitudes. Samples of muscle, gills, and liver, as well as water samples, were used for analysis of elemental accumulation. Histopathological (HP) analysis of gills and liver, and Fulton's condition factor (CF) were used as biomarkers. Analysis of Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Se, Si, Sr, and Zn was conducted by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and accordingly, metal pollution index and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) were calculated. Elemental accumulation varied considerably both among tissues and reservoirs. Reservoirs located on large low-altitude rivers were the most heavily polluted with metals (Meduvrgje, on the Zapadna Morava River, and Lake Sava, on the Sava River). Of three tissues analyzed, the gills were most affected by pollution. The levels of Hg in muscle decreased with an increase in reservoir altitude. Specimens sampled from the highest altitude reservoir were the least affected by HP alterations; however, HP differences between the reservoirs were not statistically significant, and the severity of HP changes was generally low. No significant correlations between the elemental accumulation or HP indices with CF were observed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As part of the overall management of a Hospital, the Hygiene Unit has specific tasks including the improvement in the levels of hospital safety by air quality monitoring in hospital environments to control the sources of infection and assessing the healthiness of hospital facilities. Operating theaters (OTs) and cleanrooms air quality control can represent a focal point considering that environmental contamination depends on not only factors such as characteristics and level of maintenance of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems (HVAC), but it also depends on the number of people present, their behavioral habits, sanitation and disinfection procedures adopted. Several studies demonstrate a high variability in microbial air contamination in different OTs with similar HVAC, suggesting the need for achieving strict control over the factors affecting air quality. The control of air contamination, as an indicator of the quality care provided, therefore sets precise objectives, accuracy from a scientific point of view including planning, analysis and interpretation of results to propose corrective actions. However, there are no generally accepted standards for sampling nor threshold values on microbial air contamination. Aerobiology skills can improve the approach to involved issues. The monitoring plan of air quality assessment at the Parma University Hospital, by the Laboratory of Aerobiology, involves approximately 80 environments equipped with turbulent or mixed air flow. This paper describes the practical approach to air contamination control of the Hospital Hygiene Department at the Parma University Hospital as an example of how Health Departments can improve safety standards for patients and operators.

AB  - The loss of global biodiversity is one of the major challenges of our time and urbanisation is seen as a main cause of this. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for Odonata in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on dragonfly species richness and density of 35 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 35 control ponds (CONTROL).
   Our study revealed significant differences in environmental conditions between STOPON and CONTROL. At the habitat level, STOPON were larger, had a warmer microclimate, and lower concentrations of phosphate. STOPON were predominantly situated in suburbs, while CONTROL occurred mostly in rural areas. Accordingly, at the landscape level, STOPON had greater cover of built-up area as well as a lower cover of arable land and woodland. In line with this, the dragonfly assemblages at STOPON and CONTROL differed. Overall species richness was greater at STOPON than at CONTROL, and indicator species were only identified for STOPON. Especially threatened species benefited from STOPON, having higher species richness as well as higher adult and exuviae densities than CONTROL.
   In conclusion, our study shows that stormwater ponds in urban areas play an important role in the conservation of dragonflies in general and threatened species in particular. At STOPON, as a result of regular management, the habitat quality was high and compensated for the low landscape quality stemming from significant urbanisation effects.

AB  - A lab-scale membrane bioreactor was fed with fresh urine collected from source separation public toilets to perform full nitrification, urinary nitrogen stabilization and effluent sanitation. After acclimation, a nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 1.2 kg TN per m(3) d(-1) was reached with an average nitrification rate of 98.3%. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation was studied within the MBR to identify biomass activity indicators that could be used for process optimization. By combining three-dimensional excitation emission fluorescence (3DEEM) and liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection, nitrogen detection and UV detection (LC-OCD-OND-UVD), it was possible to investigate the transformation and fate of urine DOM during biological reactions and membrane separation. Results show that urine is mainly composed of low molecular weight molecules (<1000 Da) easily consumed by the active biomass. This consumption came with the production of soluble microbial products (SMP): biopolymers and humic substances. Significant correlations were observed between 3DEEM indicators and the NLR values. Biopolymers were mainly retained by the membrane and tended to accumulate in the reactor, which was of major interest since they were identified as DOM consumed by the active biomass in case of system instabilities. Humic substances were slightly retained by the membrane and mostly implied in irreversible fouling. This original approach allowed highlighting the quick active biomass acclimation under challenging conditions of high strength ammonia solutions such as urine.

AB  - Currently, the hazy weather in China is increasingly serious. It is urgent for China to reduce haze emissions in environmental governance. A feasible way is to control haze emissions by optimizing the input sources. This paper proposed an innovative method in which the haze emission is controlled by readjusting input indicators. The output efficiency of input indicators in 29 provinces in China is calculated through 7 input indicators (namely, SO2 emissions, NOX emissions, soot emissions, coal consumption, car ownership, capital, and labor force) as well as GDP (desirable output) and PM2.5 emissions (undesirable output). The results showed that the input indicators are excessive in redundancy on condition that PM2.5 emissions and GDP are equal. The input indicators are high in redundancy rate except labor force. The redundancy rates of soot emissions, SO2 emissions and coal consumption are relatively high and, respectively, are 78, 67.18, and 61.14%. Moreover, all the provinces are redundant in inputs except Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai which are optimal in input-output efficiency. The redundancy of middle and western provinces, such as Ningxia, Guizhou, and Shanxi, is relatively large. The ideas and methods proposed in this paper can provide a reference for the future researches that aim to reduce the input indicators of undesirable output, and the empirical results can provide empirical support for the PM2.5 abatement in China.

AB  - Background: Hospital readmissions are increasingly used as a quality indicator with a belief that they are a marker of poor care and have led to financial penalties in UK and USA. Risk scoring systems, such as LACE and HOSPITAL, have been proposed as tools for identifying patients at high risk of readmission but have not been validated in international populations.
   Aim: To perform an external independent validation of the HOSPITAL and LACE scores.
   Design: An unplanned secondary cohort study.
   Methods: Patients admitted to the medical admission unit at the Hospital of South West Jutland (10/2008-2/2009; 2/2010-5/2010) and the Odense University Hospital (6/2009-8/2011) were analysed. Validation of the scores using 30 day readmissions as the endpoint was performed.
   Results: A total of 19277 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Median age was 67 (range 18-107) years and 8977 (46.6%) were female. The LACE score had a discriminatory power of 0.648 with poor calibration and the HOSPITAL score had a discriminatory power of 0.661 with poor calibration. The HOSPITAL score was significantly better than the LACE score for identifying patients at risk of 30 day readmission (P<0.001). The discriminatory power of both scores decreased with increasing age.
   Conclusion: Readmissions are a complex phenomenon with not only medical conditions contributing but also system, cultural and environmental factors exerting a significant influence. It is possible that the heterogeneity of the population and health care systems may prohibit the creation of a simple prediction tool that can be used internationally.

AB  - Since the 1980s, alpine grasslands have been seriously degraded on the Tibetan Plateau. Grazing exclusion by fencing has been widely adopted to restore degraded grasslands. To clarify the effect of grazing exclusion on soil quality, we investigated soil properties and nutrients by comparing free-grazing (FG) and grazing exclusion (GE) grasslands in Tibet. Soil properties - including soil bulk density, pH, particle size distributions, and proportion of aggregates showed no significant difference between FG and GE plots. Soil organic carbon, soil available nitrogen, and available phosphorus contents did not differ with grazing exclusion treatments in both the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layer. However, soil total nitrogen and total phosphorus contents were remarkably reduced due to grazing exclusion at 0-15 cm depth. Furthermore, growing season temperature and/or growing season precipitation had significant effects on almost all soil property and nutrient indicators. This study demonstrates that grazing exclusion had no impact on most soil properties and nutrients in Tibet. Additionally, the potential shift of climate conditions should be considered when recommending any policy designed for restoration of degraded soil in alpine grasslands in the future. Nevertheless, because the results of the present study come from a short-term (6-8 years) grazing exclusion, the assessments of the ecological effects of the grazing exclusion management strategy on soil quality of degraded alpine grasslands in Tibet still need long-term continued research.

AB  - The influence of stress in an environment, according with the behavioral and endocrine variables of primates, are increasingly being studied by a diversity of authors, and have shown that abnormal behaviors associated with increased glucocorticoids may be directly related with the impairment of their well-being. In this work were used 22 adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 11 males and 11 females, kept in captivity in three different institutions. All animals had their behavior registered by focal session using a 30 seconds sample interval, during six months, totaling 4,800 registries per each animal. During this period, fecal samples were collected 3 times a week for the extraction and measurement of the concentration of fecal metabolites of glucocorticoid by radioimmunoassay. Of the total observed, stereotypical behaviors represented 13,45 +/- 2.76%, and among them, self-mutilation represented 38.28 +/- 3.98 %. The animals were classified into three different scores, according with the percentage of body surface with alopecia due to self-mutilation. It was found a positive correlation of high intensity between the scores of alopecia due to the observed mutilation and the average concentrations of fecal metabolites of glucocorticoids. This result strongly suggests that this measurement of self-mutilation in a chimpanzee can be used as an important auxiliary tool to evaluate de conditions of adaptation of an animal in captivity, functioning as a direct indicator of the presence of chronic stress.

AB  - The liver is an organ with a differential value on the market. However, due to its metabolic functions it is susceptible to various types of alterations, including a large rate of disposal by perihepatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of perihepatitis by the Federal Inspection Service (FIS), according to histopathological examination and correlate these findings with plasmatic concentrations of AST and GGT. One hundred and fifty four culled sows of the Landrace breed were used. Slaughter was performed by the method of desensitization by electrical stimulation and subsequent exsanguination. Then 5 mL of whole blood was collected to evaluate concentrations of GGT and AST. During evisceration, liver condition was assessed by visual inspection and classified as good or condemned by perihepatitis. Also, fragments of the liver were collected to histopathologic examination. The alterations in the liver parenchyma were classified as degenerative, inflammatory or reparative. The alterations found in liver tissues, considered as perihepatitis by visual inspection, were often due to fibrosis, fatty degeneration or mild hepatitis. The serum concentrations of GGT were high. Moreover, it concentrations were higher in livers with lesions of inflammatory and degenerative nature when compared to livers without injuries (p<0.05). However, the same was not observed for AST concentrations (p>0.05). Concluding, the perihepatitis diagnosis from the FIS showed low specificity and sensitivity, and the enzyme GGT was a good indicator of liver injuries in swine.

AB  - A GIS-based approach is developed to identify the state of wilderness character in US wilderness areas using Death Valley National Park (DEVA) as a case study. A set of indicators and measures are identified by DEVA staff and used as the basis for developing a flexible and broadly applicable framework to map wilderness character using data inputs selected by park staff. Spatial data and GIS methods are used to map the condition of four qualities of wilderness character: natural, untrammelled, undeveloped, and solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation. These four qualities are derived from the US 1964 Wilderness Act and later developed by Landres et al. (2008a) in "Keeping it Wild: An Interagency Strategy to Monitor Trends in Wilderness Character Across the National Wilderness Preservation System." Data inputs are weighted to reflect their importance in relation to other data inputs and the model is used to generate maps of each of the four qualities of wilderness character. The combined map delineates the range of quality of wilderness character in the DEVA wilderness revealing the majority of wilderness character to be optimal quality with the best areas in the northern section of the park. This map will serve as a baseline for monitoring change in wilderness character and for evaluating the spatial impacts of planning alternatives for wilderness and backcountry stewardship plans. The approach developed could be applied to any wilderness area, either in the USA or elsewhere in the world. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid urban population growth, air pollution emissions, and changing patterns of disease in African cities may increase the burden of air pollution-related morbidity and mortality in coming decades. Yet, air monitoring is limited across the continent and many countries lack air quality standards. This paper focuses on particulate matter (PM) pollution, one of the most relevant and widely used indicators of urban air quality. We provide an overview of published PM monitoring studies in Africa, outline major themes, point out data gaps, and discuss strategies for addressing particulate air pollution in rapidly growing African cities. Our review reveals that, although few studies have reported annual mean levels of coarse and fine particles, collective evidence from short- and long-term air monitoring studies across urban Africa demonstrates that pollution levels often exceed international guidelines. Furthermore, pollution levels may be rising as a result of increased motor vehicle traffic building on already high background concentrations of PM in many locations due to climatic and geographic conditions. Biomass burning and industrial activities, often located in cities, further exacerbate levels of PM. Despite the health risks this situation presents, air quality programs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have been stalled or discontinued in recent years. Implementation of systematic PM data collection would enable air pollution-related health impact assessments, the development of strategies to reduce the air pollution health burden, and facilitate urban planning and transportation policy as it relates to air quality and health.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel derived from plant, waste, or algal oils. It is synthesized by the transesterification of triglycerides with an alcohol to yield fatty acid alkyl esters. These esters are prone to oxidative deterioration, yielding a variety of products which increase the viscosity of the fuel beyond acceptable levels. A proportion of the fuel used will always find its way into the vehicle's lubricating oil with dilution becoming increasingly significant on vehicles equipped with a particulate filter because late injections lead to increased wall wetting. Biodiesel will also accumulate in the lubricating oil but, unlike mineral diesel, the biodiesel will not evaporate at the normal operating temperature of the oil and will instead accumulate. As the biodiesel oxidizes within the oil, degradation products will eventually form, leading to a significant increase in the oil viscosity with a potential impact on base engine durability. This study investigates the relative effects of a number of factors likely to be relevant to biodiesel oxidation within a simulated engine lubrication oil environment. The findings of this study suggest that determining the point at which oxidation occurs is inherently difficult and the impact of various factors can vary depending on the oxidation indicator examined. The most significant factors in total oxidation were found to be the temperature and air flowrate with other factors, such as the presence of iron and pro-oxidant, having a significant impact only after initial oxidation reactions had occurred.

AB  - P>Background:
   Mean platelet volume (MPV) is arousing increasing interest as a new independent cardiovascular risk factor.
   Aim:
   To provide a comprehensive review on the biological significance, the main determinants and the prognostic implications of MPV.
   Methods:
   A literature search was performed using key terms, such as 'MPV' or 'mean platelet volume', together with 'stroke', 'myocardial infarction' and 'diabetes and 'obesity'.
   Results:
   Large platelets are likely more reactive: elevated MPV values are associated with a shortened bleeding time and increased thromboxane B2 plasma levels. Thus, MPV could be considered an indicator of platelet function. Platelet size is mainly determined in the bone marrow during megakaryocytopoiesis, and subsequently does not substantially change. MPV is only partially regulated by thrombopoietin: in fact, growth factors and cytokines may also elicit the production of larger and more reactive platelets in the bone marrow, in the presence of conditions capable of increasing their concentrations, such as obesity, endothelial dysfunction and possibly myocardial and cerebral ischaemia. This phenomenon could play an important role in vascular diseases. In fact MPV is predictive of stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and restenosis of coronary angioplasty, is increased in the presence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, AMI and stroke and has been shown to have a prognostic significance in patients with stroke and AMI.
   Conclusion:
   In assessing whole blood count, MPV should not be undervalued, as its increase should suggest a careful assessment of cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Management plans to reduce human-caused deaths of North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis depend, in part, on knowing when and where right whales are likely to be found. Local environmental conditions that influence movements of feeding right whales, such as ultra-dense copepod patches, are unpredictable and ephemeral. We examined the utility of using the regional-scale mean copepod concentration as an indicator of the abundance of right whales in 2 critical habitats off the northeastern coast of the United States: Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Right whales are usually found in Cape Cod Bay during the late winter and early spring, and in the Great South Channel during the late spring and early summer. We found a significant positive relationship between mean concentration of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus in the western Gulf of Maine and the frequency of right whale sightings in the Great South Channel. In Cape Cod Bay we found a significant positive relationship between the mean concentration of other copepods (largely Pseudocalanus spp. and Centropages spp.) and the frequency of right whale sightings. This information could be used to further our understanding of the environmental factors that drive seasonal movement and aggregation of right whales in the Gulf of Maine, and it offers a tool to resource managers and modelers who seek to predict the movements of right whales based upon the concentration of copepods.

AB  - Phototrophic biofilms are defined as interfacial microbial communities mainly driven by light as energy source and are studied for both ecological and technological reasons. Field investigations of biofilms usually do not offer the opportunity to study the effects of a large number of external parameters. in order to investigate the temporal development of phototrophic communities a laboratory flow-lane incubator for cultivation of freshwater and marine biofilms was developed. The incubator has four lanes which accommodate microscope slides used as substratum and for sampling. The slides can be of different material and may be employed for characterisation of phototrophic biofilms by means of gravimetry, microscopy, taxonomy, molecular biology and chemical analysis. The design allows control of irradiance, temperature and flow velocity. Furthermore, on-line control of biomass accumulation via specially adapted light sensors was proved to be a suitable indicator of temporal developmental stages (initial adhesion, active growth and mature stage). Spatial heterogeneity of the cultivated phototrophic biofilms along the flow direction within each flow-lane was low. Biofilm growth characteristics (e. g. lag time, net accrual rate, peak biomass) recorded in dependency from external conditions may be used as input data for training of artificial neural networks (ANN) and mechanistic modelling. The material and devices used in combination with low maintenance costs and ease of handling suggests the flow-lane incubator as a useful tool for studying the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the development of freshwater and marine phototrophic biofilms.

AB  - During the last 30 years, the increase of the human population in the Amazon introduced the need for additional food production and caused the state government to implement programs to increase and improve agricultural production. The production of nontraditional crops introduced several problems unknown to traditional farmers, since they are not well adapted to tropical conditions. Their susceptibility to insects, fungi and other plagues, and the competition with native vegetation forced farmers to use pesticides intensively. Amazonian farmers were not adequately prepared for the use of this new technology; they ignored the risk of pesticides to human health and the environment. Using the region of the state capital Manaus as an example, the characteristics of the pesticide use are described (e.g. the increased use and the lack of personal protective equipment, as well as the legal situation). In detail, the registration status of pesticides used in the State of Amazonas and the state of their registration in the European Union is compared. Finally, it is concluded that the use and the fate of pesticides in the Amazon region has to be monitored. Data of the effects on humans and on the environment have to be collected from the literature or have to be produced in standardized tests, so that an environmental risk assessment becomes possible. Training and information programs are urgently needed in order to build up environmentally sustainable agriculture. Finally, the enforcement of Brazilian laws concerning pesticide registration has to be improved.

AB  - This paper investigates allocation of energy to mechanisms that generate and preserve architectural forms (i.e. developmental stability, complexity of branching patterns) and productivity (growth and reproduction) in response to environmental disturbances (i.e. grazing and resource availability). The statistical error in translational symmetry was used to detect random intra-individual variability during development. This can be thought of as a measure of developmental instability caused by stress. Additionally, we use changes in fractal complexity and shoot distribution of branch structures as an alternate indicator of stress. These methods were applied to Anthyllis cytisoides L., a semi-arid environment shrub, to ascertain the effect of grazing and slope exposure on developmental traits in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The results show that A. cytisoides maintains developmental stability at the expense of productivity. Anthyllis cytisoides was developmentally more stable when grazed and when on south-facing, as opposed to north-facing slopes. On the contrary, shoot length, leaf area, fractal dimension and reproductive-to-vegetative allocation ratio were larger in north-than in south-facing slopes. As a consequence, under extreme xeric conditions, shrub mortality increased in north-facing slopes, especially when not grazed. The removal of transpiring area and the reduction of plant competition favoured developmental stability and survival in grazed plants. Differences between grazed and ungrazed plants were most evident in more mesic (north-facing) areas. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Alpine plants often appear to have long life-spans as an adaptation to harsh and unpredictable environmental conditions, yet many lack reliable indicators of age that would make it possible to determine their true longevity. Their extended lifespans also pose problems for measuring lifetime reproductive success, a key component of breeding system evolution in species such as the gynodioecious cushion plant Silene acaulis. For a population of S. acaulis in south-central Alaska, we applied a recently derived analytical approach using size-based population projection matrices that allowed us to estimate: (1) the relationship between cushion diameter and age; and (2) lifetime reproductive success through seed production by females relative to hermaphrodites. Because of a combination of slow growth, frequent shrinkage, and extremely high adult survival, we estimate that the largest cushions in our study population exceed 300 yr in age, and some may live substantially longer, despite the seemingly inhospitable alpine environment they inhabit. Females are estimated to produce 4.4 times as many offspring via seed production over the course of their lives as do hermaphrodites, a difference that is more than sufficient to assure the persistence of females despite their inability to transmit genes through pollen. These results highlight the utility of size-based projection matrices for studying the life histories of herbaceous perennials whose life-span and lifetime reproductive success cannot be determined easily by any other means.

AB  - Sand-solution experiments involving 15 herbs and 13 graminoids were performed to study how biomass was effected by N concentrations of 50, 250 and 1250 mu M, respectively, in a simulated acid forest soil solution. The concentrations of the various components corresponded with those found in soil solutions in deciduous forests of southern Sweden. The experiments were undertaken to study the extent to which species are affected differently by increases in the concentration of N as compared with that of the other nutrients. The underlying hypothesis was that species with a high demand for N and a lesser demand for other nutrients are particularly competitive in areas with acidic soil and a high degree of N deposition. The graminoids were found to be favoured more than the herbs by the addition of N, 46% displaying a significantly greater biomass at 250 than at 50 mu M N as compared with only 7% for the herbs. Some species attained their highest biomass at 1250 mu M N and others at 50 mu M N. It is concluded that at the highest N concentration, growth was limited for most species by the supply of other nutrients and that at the intermediate N concentration the graminoids were more efficient than the herbs in utilising N. It was found that the Ellenberg N indicator values could not be used to predict biomass production under the conditions studied since they failed to adequately explain the response to treatment by N.

AB  - Isolated rat-liver nuclei were incubated with a series of membrane-permeable metal-ion-complexing agents and examined for DNA damage. Of the reagents tested, only 1,10-phenanthroline (OF) and neocuproine (NC) were found to induce DNA fragmentation. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of the DNA fragments generated in the presence of OP revealed internucleosomal cleavage, which is widely considered to be a hallmark for the enzymic DNA digestion that occurs during apoptosis. Ascorbate, particularly in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, increased the levels of fragmentation induced by OF. As. well as undergoing fragmentation, the DNA from nuclei was also found to contain 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, which indicates attack (oxidation) by the:hydroxyl radical. Complementary experiments in vitro involving ESR determinations of hydroxyl radical formation and measurements of DNA oxidation under biomimetic conditions demonstrated that Cu2+, but not Fe3+, forms a complex with either OP or NC (but not the other complexing agents tested) that stimulates hydroxyl radical formation and DNA damage in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and ascorbate, It is therefore proposed that OP in the nuclei incubations binds to Cu2+, which exists naturally in chromosomes, forming a complex that promotes hydroxyl-radical-dependent DNA fragmentation. These findings demonstrate the promotion of hydroxyl-radical-mediated DNA damage by endogenous Cu2+ and, perhaps more significantly, demonstrate that the internucleosomal DNA 'laddering' that is often used as an indicator of apoptosis may also result from DNA fragmentation by non-enzymic processes.

AB  - The Weinan loess-soil sequence in central China provides litho,genic, geochemical and palaeopedological evidence of past changes in the eastern Asian monsoon climate. The chemical weathering index as defined by Nesbitt and Young [1982] and the SiO2/TiO2 ratio are found to be sensitive indicators of the strengths of the summer and winter monsoons, respectively. Over the last climatic cycle, strong summer monsoon occurred during six time intervals with an apparent similar to 20,000 years cycle, the major component of the Earth's orbital precession. Strengthening of the summer monsoon and weakening of the winter monsoon is approximately in phase. Micromorphological study of the palaeosols reveals a landscape variability from north temperate steppe (Haplic Chernozems) to subtropical forest (Chromic Luvisol) environments for the interstadial and interglacial periods.
   Changes in both orbitally produced north summer insolation and glacial age boundary condition are necessary to explain the major shifts of the monsoon climate. Within the constraints of the used lime scale, the variations of the monsoon climate are basically coeval with the variations of the global ice volume as indicated by the marine delta(18)O record. Moreover, the amplitudes of monsoon variability and the landscape evolution display however striking discrepancies with the global ice volume, which may be better explained by the variations of the summer insolation in the northern hemisphere with an apparent time lag of several thousands years for the loess sequence.

AB  - Stable carbon isotopes are now being investigated by an increasing number of palaeobotany researchers. The ratio of the two stable isotopes of carbon (C-12 and C-13) is controlled by a number of biological processes, including photosynthesis, which took place in the original plant. These isotopic signals are also increasingly being used as indicators to interpret the composition of deposits containing organic carbon. A fundamental requirement therefore is that either the isotopic ratio should not significantly change after burial, or any changes must be understood and preferably quantifiable. Preliminary new investigations have been undertaken into a formation, rich in fossil plants, in the Lower Carboniferous of Donegal, Ireland. The bulk of the fossil plants is preserved as fusain (fusinite and semi-fusinite) or fossil charcoal. A series of isotopic measurements of the material were taken and these revealed the fossils to be anomalously isotopically heavy when compared with other known deposits of similar age, plant assemblages and history. There are three possible explanations, or combinations of explanations, for these anomalous results: (1) the Donegal fossils represent evidence of photosynthetic pathways that were previously generally believed to have evolved much later; (2) the fossils have undergone significant isotopic fractionation as a result of, as yet unknown, taphonomic and diagenetic processes; (3) palaeoenvironmental conditions were such that C3 plants acquired isotopically heavy ratios during life, and this has been preserved in the fossil record.

AB  - Aryl-iodonium salts are utilized as photoacid generators (PAGs) in semiconductor photolithography and other photo-initiated manufacturing processes. Despite their utilization and suspected toxicity, the fate of these compounds within the perimeter of semiconductor fabrication plants is inadequately understood; the identification of photolithography products is still needed for a comprehensive environmental impact assessment. This study investigated the photolytic transformation of a representative iodonium PAG cation, bis-(4-tert-butyl phenyl)-iodonium, under conditions simulating industrial photolithography. Under 254-nm irradiation, bis-(4-tert-butyl phenyl)-iodonium reacted rapidly with a photolytic half-life of 39.2 s; different counter ions or solvents did not impact the degradation kinetics. At a semiconductor photolithography-relevant UV dosage of 25 mJ cm(-2), 33% of bis-(4-tert-butyl phenyl)-iodonium was estimated to be transformed. Six aromatic/hydrophobic photoproducts were identified utilizing a combination of HPLC-DAD and GC-MS. Selected photoproducts such as tert-butyl benzene and tert-butyl iodobenzene had remarkably higher acute microbial toxicity toward bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri compared to bis-(4-tert-butyl phenyl)-iodonium. Octanol-water partition coefficients estimated using the Estimation Programs Interface Suite (TM) indicated that the photoproducts were substantially more hydrophobic than the parent compound. The results fill a critical data gap hindering the environmental impact assessment of iodonium PAGs and provide clues on potential management strategies for both iodonium compounds and their photoproducts.

AB  - The maximum soil freezing depth (MSFD) is an important indicator of the thermal state of seasonally frozen ground. Its variation has important implications for the water cycle, ecological processes, climate and engineering stability. This study tested three aspects of data-driven predictions of MSFD in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), including comparison of three popular statistical/machine learning techniques, differences between remote sensing variables and reanalysis data as input conditions, and transportability of the model built by reanalysis data. The results show that support vector regression (SVR) performs better than random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and the ensemble mean of the three models. Compared with the climate predictors, the remote sensing predictors are helpful for improving the simulation accuracy of the MSFD at both decadal and annual scales (at the annual and decadal scales, the root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced by 2.84 and 1.99 cm, respectively). The SVR model with climate predictor calibration using the in situ MSFD at the baseline period (2001-2010) can be used to simulate the MSFD over historical periods (1981-1990 and 1991-2000). This result indicates the good transferability of the well-trained machine learning model and its availability to simulate the MSFD of the past and the future when remote sensing predictors are not available.

AB  - The spectacular water outburst occurring semi-periodically when the ice-dam formed by the external front of the Perito Moreno glacier collapses, is one of the most attracting events in the UNESCO 'Parque Nacional Los Glaciares' of southern Patagonia. These occurrences have been documented since 1936. Instead, evidence of previous events has been only indirectly provided by dendrochronology analysis. Here we show for the first time radiocarbon-dated sediment cores collected within a small inlet of Brazo Sur, that is, the southern arm of Lago Argentino that record ice-dammings in the Little Ice Age, at 324-266 cal yrs BP, as measured on a vegetal fragment sampled at ca. 14 cm from the top of a core. A common characteristic of the three sediment cores is the abrupt change in the stratigraphic record found at variable depths of 14-18 cm from the top of the cores. This change is marked by a hiatus spanning ca. 3200 years, separating planar-laminated sediments below from an alternation of erosional and depositional events above it, indicating recurring high-energy conditions generated by the emptying of the lake basin. In addition, we observed significant changes in the abundance of environmental indicators as testate amoebae below and above the hiatus. These well-preserved stratigraphic records highlight the key role of glaciolacustine deposits in reconstructing the glacial dynamics and palaeoclimate evolution of a glaciated region.

AB  - Sedimentological, paleontological, and geochemical data from core XK-1 on the Xisha Islands have allowed for a detailed documentation of the early carbonate development around the Oligocene-Miocene transition in the northern South China Sea (SCS). The deposits within the fore reef, reef, lagoon environments occurred before 23 Ma, the exposure horizon occurred around 23 Ma, and the sediments within the open lagoon setting dominated after 23 Ma. This evolution indicates a sedimentological response to water depth change, which is the combined result of eustatic sea-level fluctuations and tectonic subsidence. The tectonic subsidence during the latest Oligocene and Early Miocene (especially this period) was responsible for the obvious deepening trend. What's more, substantial physical erosion caused an increased amount of terrigenous input into the Xisha Islands area, with detrimental effects on carbonate development after the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. Over the entire South China Sea, the early carbonate systems along the northern and southern margins displayed specific evolution patterns. After comparing these patterns, we found a close relationship between the carbonate initiation and the subduction of the proto-SCS and the opening of the modern SCS. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that sea level and local tectonics as well as paleoclimatic conditions were the main controlling factors in shaping the onset of carbonate sedimentation in the SCS.

AB  - The analysis of ecosystem change represents a key aspect to evaluate the impacts produced by desertification. Desertification is a process that affects soils with high instability and produces, in some cases, irreversible abrupt change responses. Therefore, assessing and modelling the spatio-temporal dynamics of desertification with remote sensing is a high research priority. It is important to assess how desertification affects the percentage of vegetation cover. But it is also very important to know how it affects the distribution of species and their functional status. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed in order to optimise the information obtained from degraded soils or drylands. One of the main limitations lies in the low signal-to-noise ratio of vegetation characterised by high soil reflectance and relatively sparse and heterogeneous vegetation. In this work, we identify some aspects that would improve the reliability of remote sensing analyses. Specifically, we recommend 1) intensifying the study of indicators by including not only changes in structure but also changes in vegetation condition or functionality and vegetation composition, 2) improving the estimation of structural and functional indicators using physical models and advanced computer models, 3) improving the multi-scale study of changes in diversity by adapting field sampling methods to the different image resolutions, 4) analysing the processes of change in structure, functionality and composition based on dynamic models that contemplate the processes of change and allow for a better understanding of the impact of desertification on ecosystem services.

AB  - International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 356 Site U1461 represents one of the few records from the North West Australian shelf that provides information about aridity fluctuations in Australia during the Quaternary. A combination of chronostratigraphic indicators revealed the (partial) preservation of two major glaciations (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 and MIS 12) in the sedimentary record. The faunal content (mainly benthic foraminifera, corals and bryozoans) was analyzed to estimate paleo-environments and paleo-depths in order to determine if these sediments have been remobilized by reworking processes. Despite the occurrence of a depositional hiatus (including MIS 5d to MIS 9-time interval), the excellent preservation of faunal content suggests that the preserved sediment is in situ. The geochemical composition of the sediments (Nd and major elements) indicates that during MIS 12 riverine input was likely reduced because of enhanced aridity, and the sediment provenance (mainly atmospheric dust) is likely in the central (Lake Eyre) or eastern (Murray Darling Basin) parts of the Australian continent. MIS 2 is confirmed to be one of the driest periods recorded in Australia but with mixed dust sources from the eastern and western parts of the continent. More humid conditions followed the glacial maximum, which might correspond to the peak of the Indian-Australian Summer Monsoon.

AB  - Urban growth is one of the indicators that reflects human interaction with the environment and has a direct effect on land use change. Continuous demand for space in Nigeria's urban markets to accommodate shops and other retail outlets used for informal economic activities is accompanied by a change of use. This study examined the impact of informal economic activities on change of use in Bola Ige International Market, Ibadan. The concept of informal economy and the bid rent theory provided the conceptual/theoretical framework for this study. Geographical Information System was used to capture the change of use between 2006 and 2016. Land used for informal economic activities increased from 39.45% in 2006 to 55.35% in 2016, signifying a 15.9% increase. This implies that other land uses have been illegally converted and encroached. Transportation land use decreased from 31.47% in 2006 to 30.28% in 2011 and to 28.73% in 2016. Land used for open space (including parking space, and open trading area) which was 26.7% in 2006 reduced to 20.24% and 11.05% in 2011 and 2016, respectively. Most of the green areas (62.1%) have been converted to informal trading spaces between 2006 and 2016. Illegal change of use was credited to harsh economic condition in the country, and the engagement of the unemployed and retirees in informal sector economic activities. It was suggested that urban managers in conjunction with informed activists, researchers and citizens need to formulate and implement planning regulations that will integrate informal economic activities.

AB  - Heat stress is one of the most important environmental stressors facing poultry production and welfare worldwide. The detrimental effects of heat stress on poultry range from reduced growth and egg production to impaired health. Animal vocalisations are associated with different animal responses and can be used as useful indicators of the state of animal welfare. It is already known that specific chicken vocalisations such as alarm, squawk, and gakel calls are correlated with stressful events, and therefore, could be used as stress indicators in poultry monitoring systems. In this study, we focused on developing a hen vocalisation detection method based on machine learning to assess their thermal comfort condition. For extraction of the vocalisations, nine source-filter theory related temporal and spectral features were chosen, and a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier was developed. As a result, the classification performance of the optimal SVM model was 95.1 +/- 4.3% (the sensitivity parameter) and 97.6 +/- 1.9% (the precision parameter). Based on the developed algorithm, the study illustrated that a significant correlation existed between specific vocalisations (alarm and squawk call) and thermal comfort indices (temperature-humidity index, THI) (alarm-THI, R = -0.414, P = 0.01; squawk-THI, R = 0.594, P = 0.01). This work represents the first step towards the further development of technology to monitor flock vocalisations with the intent of providing producers an additional tool to help them actively manage the welfare of their flock.

AB  - Taxis provide a type of on-demand mobility service in urban transportation. There are growing concerns regarding the level of service of taxis in satisfying residents' mobility demand. However, the mismatch between demand and supply of taxi services has not been resolved even with the introduction of app-based vehicle services. In this study, three indicators are constructed using the Shanghai taxi global positioning system (GPS) dataset to reveal the spatial-temporal mismatch pattern. The issue is further analyzed via a case study, in which seven regions with frequent mismatch patterns are identified in the time period from 21:00 to 22:00. Then, a multinomial logistic regression model is employed to identify the demographic and built-environment factors contributing to the taxi mismatch problem. The study results show that population density, residential areas, the number of points of interest, and road density have significant relationships with the taxi undersupply. In contrast, the areas of commercial lands, as well as the other two transportation-related factors, that is, the number of bus stops and the distance to nearest subway station, are observed to be statistically significant for both "oversupply" and "undersupply" conditions. This study provides valuable insights for identifying mismatch patterns and interpreting the mismatch problem as a function of spatially explicit factors that are of great use for urban governance, especially in the improvement of taxi efficiency, taxi management, and urban planning.

AB  - Transport is widely considered as a sector with significant positive and negative externalities affecting society, environment and economy. The fact of incorporating the main principles of sustainable development into transport planning is of prime importance. However, moving towards transport sustainability is a challenging task; it requires a paradigm shift as well as the constant monitoring and intensive evaluation of the current conditions through broadly accepted methodological tools such as indicators. In this context, the scope of the current research is to provide a complete picture of the approaches which aim at measuring progress towards transport sustainability as well as facilitating the development of new initiatives by highlighting the major trends. Consequently, a considerable number (78) of sustainable transport indicator initiatives were selected through an extensive literature review. Accordingly, descriptive statistics was used regarding the main features of the examined initiatives, while an analysis focused on the 2644 included indicators was subsequently implemented. The current research illustrates the linkages among the sustainability pillars and the selected objectives/themes. It also points out the great variability regarding the hierarchical structure, categorizes the considerable number of themes found in the literature into smaller groups, presents the most commonly used themes and indicators, and finally proposes an alternative categorization of weighting schemes concerning indexes. An attempt has been made so that this study can become a meaningful operational tool for researchers aiming at promoting the relevant research by contributing to the selection of the most suitable yet compatible and scientifically valid methods for each case.

AB  - Earthworms are among the most important soil ecosystem engineers. Their effects on soil structure have been well documented, however, there is limited knowledge on how earthworms in the long term affect the soil microbiome, especially in arable soils. We investigated the soil microbiome of rice (cultivated under aerobic condition) and wheat fields in two consecutive seasons after manipulating earthworms and organic amendments for 14 years. Composition of soil prokaryotes and eukaryotes were analyzed by Illumina sequencing. Molecular network analysis suggest that in mulched rice fields earthworms foster species interlinked with many others and shift the dominance of prokaryotes from Planctomycetes to Proteobacteria. In contrast, In fields where residues were incorporated into the soil earthworms shifted the dominance of prokaryotes from Proteobacteria to Planctomycetes. Further, earthworms significantly increased the Proteobacteria-to-Acidobacteria ratio, a putative indicator of high nutrient turnover. Further, the ratio of prokaryote-to-eukaryote abundance was increased by earthworms when straw was incorporated into the soil. In conclusion, the results suggest that in the long term earthworms mainly modify the structure and functioning of prokaryote rather than eukaryote communities In arable fields. The effects of earthworms on the structure of microbial communities and microbial interactions are closely linked to resource management practices. The more pronounced effects of earthworms in treatments with residues mulched as compared to incorporated into the soil suggest that earthworm effects in part were due to bioturbation, i.e. mixing straw with mineral soil.

AB  - Naranjilla ("little orange"), also known as lulo (Solanum quitoense Lam.), is a perennial shrub species cultivated in the Andes for fresh fruit and juice production. In 2015, a naranjilla plant exhibiting stunting, mosaic, and chlorotic spots was sampled in the Pastaza province of Ecuador and maintained under greenhouse conditions. An infectious agent was mechanically transmitted to indicator plants and was subjected to biological and molecular characterization. Spherical particles approximately 30 nm in diameter, composed of a single 20-kDa capsid protein, were observed under an electron microscope in infected naranjilla plants. High throughput sequencing conducted on inoculated Nicotiana benthamiana plants produced a single sequence contig sharing the closest relationship with several tymoviruses. The entire 6,245-nucleotide genome of a new tymovirus was amplified using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and resequenced with the Sanger methodology. The genome had three open reading frames typical of tymoviruses, and displayed a whole-genome nucleotide identity level with the closest tymovirus, Eggplant mosaic virus, at 71% (90% coverage). This tymovirus from naranjilla was able to systemically infect eggplant, tamarillo, N. benthamiana, and naranjilla. In naranjilla, it produced mosaic, chlorotic spots, and stunting, similar to the symptoms observed in the original plant. The virus was unable to infect potato and tobacco and unable to systemically infect pepper plants, replicating only in inoculated leaves. We concluded that this virus represented a new tymovirus infecting naranjilla, and proposed the tentative name Naranjilla chlorotic mosaic virus (NarCMV).

AB  - ObjectivesAmong couples, women usually prefer slightly older men, and men tend to choose much younger partners. Age difference between partners has been shown to influence their parity; however, results of previous studies are inconsistent. This study analyzed relationships between husband and wife age difference and their total number of children, and number of daughters and sons in a contemporary, rural Polish population.
   MethodsDemographic and reproductive data were collected from 384 postmenopausal women from rural Poland who were married only once. Regression models were used to evaluate the impact of the age gap between partners on total number of children and on number of daughters and sons. Women's age, age at marriage (as an indicator of reproductive value), and years of education were used in analyzes as potential confounders.
   ResultsThere was an inverted U-shape association between parental age difference and number of children and also the number of sons. The highest number of children and sons was observed when men were approximately 6.5 years older than their wives. There was no significant relationship between parental age difference and number of daughters.
   ConclusionsAge difference between partners is important for reproductive success (with younger wives having higher reproductive potential) and is also related to number of sons. Older husbands might provide more resources for the family, thus facilitating production of well-nourished male offspring. Future research should evaluate not only number of children but also their biological condition, health, and lifetime achievements in relation to the age difference between their parents.

AB  - In this study, fuzzy AHP method is used for extracting the water quality indicators based on the Schuler standard and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines during a 20-year period. For this purpose, the best fit of the zoning model was performed. Furthermore, by comparing the standard errors, the continuous Raster layer was extracted from the important parameters used in generating the qualitative potential assessment index. The classified layer was generated by integrating continuous layers in the GIS environment and with the use of Python programming. The similarity of the outputs of both methods indicates the presence of large sections of aquifers in the middle and southwestern regions of Iran in the "temporarily drinkable" and "bad" classes. The calculations showed that the majority of aquifers that were located in the "inappropriate" class during the first 10 years fell to less valuable class types. Based on the results of the model, there is a direct correlation between the drop in water resources and the decline in the quality indices. In addition, in the Urmia and Bushehr coastal aquifers, due to excessive water withdrawal and salty water penetration, the quality of the table water is in critical condition. Based on the results of the research, the aquifers in the range of Zagros and Alborz mountains show the least change in water quality. The reason for this is the depth of the aquifer and the ability to recharge it.

AB  - The value of estuarine habitats is often measured by their contribution to the adult component of the population, but a broader suite of attributes can also contribute to nursery function. Identifying and quantifying these elements allows habitat repair to be effectively targeted toward improving ecosystem function for desirable species. We present a study that incorporates stable isotopes and quantitative sampling to investigate the relative importance of different estuarine areas for juveniles of exploited prawn species within the context of habitat rehabilitation, and the potential drivers of these relationships. Eastern King Prawn (Penaeus [Melicertus] plebejus) and School Prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) were studied for two years in the lower Hunter River estuary, on the temperate east coast of Australia. The higher salinity areas near the lower end of the estuary were most important for Eastern King Prawn, and marsh systems in the lower estuary were only important for the species where there was good connectivity with oceanic water. Areas along the estuary were important for juvenile School Prawn, especially marsh habitats, and relative abundance tended to increase with increasing distance along the estuary. Designation of effective juvenile habitat for School Prawn may have been affected by high fishing mortality in fished areas, but this requires further investigation. Salinity, depth, turbidity and distance along the estuary were all important indicators of prawn distribution. The implications of these patterns for current and future habitat rehabilitation in temperate Australia are discussed.

   Findings - The integration of the three dimensions of overall performance requires involving all stakeholders in the implementation of innovative management control. Research limitations/implications - The case is a pilot experiment and shows the conditions for an appropriate design of an overall performance management control methodology. However, further experiments should be carried out to shed light on the factors that form invariants regarding integrated performance log-books.
   Practical implications - The study design is that of a management control methodology that enables the short-and long-run economic impacts of social and environmental performance.
   Social implications - The action-research process has proved to be a learning experience for the hospital and both internal and external stakeholders. However, replicability remains to be proven through experimenting the method in various settings.
   Originality/value - This paper shows the need for negotiation of overall performance with all stakeholders to design and implement an appropriate participative approach to management control.

AB  - Arthropods form a major part of the terrestrial species diversity in the Arctic, and are particularly sensitive to temporal changes in the abiotic environment. It is assumed that most Arctic arthropods are habitat generalists and that their diversity patterns exhibit low spatial variation. The empirical basis for this assumption, however, is weak. We examine the degree of spatial variation in species diversity and assemblage structure among five habitat types at two sites of similar abiotic conditions and plant species composition in southwest Greenland, using standardized field collection methods for spiders, beetles and butterflies. We employed non-metric multidimensional scaling, species richness estimation, community dissimilarity and indicator species analysis to test for local (within site)- and regional (between site)-scale differences in arthropod communities. To identify specific drivers of local arthropod assemblages, we used a combination of ordination techniques and linear regression. Species richness and the species pool differed between sites, with the latter indicating high species turnover. Local-scale assemblage patterns were related to soil moisture and temperature. We conclude that Arctic arthropod species assemblages vary substantially over short distances due to local soil characteristics, while regional variation in the species pool is likely influenced by geographic barriers, i.e., inland ice sheet, glaciers, mountains and large water bodies. In order to predict future changes to Arctic arthropod diversity, further efforts are needed to disentangle contemporary drivers of diversity at multiple spatial scales.

AB  - Two field data sets of near-bed velocity, pressure, and sediment concentration are analyzed to study the influence of infragravity waves on sand suspension and cross-shore transport. On the moderately sloping Sand Motor beach (approximate to 1:35), the local ratio of infragravity wave height to sea-swell wave height is relatively small (H-IG/H-SW < 0.4), and sand fluxes are related to the correlation of the infragravity-wave orbital motion with the sea-swell wave envelope, r(0). When the largest sea-swell waves are present during negative infragravity velocities (bound wave, negative correlation r(0)), most sand is suspended here, and the infragravity sand flux q(IG) is offshore. When r(0) is positive, the largest sea-swell waves are present during positive infragravity velocities (free wave), and q(IG) is onshore directed. For both cases, the infragravity contribution to the total sand flux is, however, relatively small (< 20%). In the inner surf zone of the gently (approximate to 1: 80) sloping Ameland beach, the infragravity waves are relatively large (H-IG/H-SW > 0.4), most sand is suspended during negative infragravity velocities, and q(IG) is offshore directed. The infragravity contribution to the total sand flux is considerably larger and reaches up to approximate to 60% during energetic conditions. On the whole, H-IG/H-SW is a good indicator for the infragravity-related sand suspension mechanism and the resulting infragravity sand transport direction and relative importance.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has recently been developed to identify sources of fecal contamination, but information regarding environmental fate of mtDNA is limited. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the persistence of three species-specific mtDNA markers (human, pig and chicken) in river microcosms under different laboratory conditions and in dialysis tubes incubated in river environments during different seasons. Human feces had a higher abundance of mtDNA marker than pig and chicken feces. A biphasic decay pattern was observed for the mtDNA markers in microcosms incubated in darkness, and T-90 (time needed for 90% reduction) ranged from 2.03 to 13.83 d. Each species-specific mtDNA marker persisted for relatively longer time at lower temperatures, and light exposure and predation increased the decay rates. Field experiments showed that the mtDNA markers could survive for longer time in winter (T-90: 1.79-4.37 d) than in summer (T-90: 0.60-0.75 d). Field application of mtDNA technology indicated that the markers were mainly distributed on the sites near animal breeding plants and had lower abundance in downstream water of the receiving river. This study expands our knowledge of the environmental fate of mtDNA markers and the results may be useful for practical application of the technology in fecal source tracking. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) is the main climate feature of the Southwest Pacific. It is characterized by a band of intense convective rainfall extending from the western Pacific warm pool to French Polynesia. Strong precipitation gradients within the SPCZ make local hydrologic conditions very sensitive to small displacements of this rainfall band, as those caused by El Nino and La Nina events. The associated rainfall fluctuations strongly impact the vulnerable Southwest Pacific countries. They are recorded in environmental indicators such as corals, used as proxies of past evolution of the El Nino/Southem Oscillation (ENSO). Here we analyze a set of paleoclimate and future climate simulations and present evidence that changes in the background tropical state largely control the mean SPCZ location. In contrast, changes in the background tropical state do not directly control the interannual variability of the SPCZ location. We show that changes in the interannual variability of the SPCZ location cannot be directly imputable to changes in the ENSO amplitude, or rather the relationship between ENSO and the SPCZ location varies from one climate to another. We thus demonstrate that the teleconnection mechanisms inferred from the modern climate cannot be directly extrapolated to other climates. This study therefore calls for a cautious interpretation of climate reconstructions from environmental indicators in the Southwest Pacific with regard to ENSO variations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Differential palisade and spongy parenchyma structural changes in oilseed rape leaf were demonstrated. These dismantling processes were linked to early senescence events and associated to remobilization processes.
   During leaf senescence, an ordered cell dismantling process allows efficient nutrient remobilization. However, in Brassica napus plants, an important amount of nitrogen (N) in fallen leaves is associated with low N remobilization efficiency (NRE). The leaf is a complex organ mainly constituted of palisade and spongy parenchyma characterized by different structures and functions concerning water relations and carbon fixation. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate a specific structural evolution of these parenchyma throughout natural senescence in B. napus, probably linked to differential nutrient remobilization processes. The study was performed on 340 leaves from 32 plants during an 8-week development period under controlled growing conditions. Water distribution and status at the cellular level were investigated by low-field proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), while light and electron microscopy were used to observe cell and plast structure. Physiological parameters were determined on all leaves studied and used as indicators of leaf development and remobilization progress. The results revealed a process of hydration and cell enlargement of leaf tissues associated with senescence. Wide variations were observed in the palisade parenchyma while spongy cells changed only very slightly. The major new functional information revealed was the link between the early senescence events and specific tissue dismantling processes.

AB  - Pollen data of 646 surface samples from northern China and Mongolia and climatic data from the relevant meteorological stations were collected in this study to develop more reliable pollen-climate transfer functions for temperate eastern Asia. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to examine the pollen-climate relationships, and mean summer precipitation (MSP) and mean January temperature (MJaT) were inferred to be the first and second important factors controlling the spatial distribution of the surface pollen in the study area. The original dataset was screened with CCA for MSP and MJaT separately to detect anomalous samples that show the extreme values. The first screened dataset was established after excluding those anomalous samples, and the initial transfer function was generated using the weighted averaging partial least squares (WAPLS) method. The jackknife test was then applied to the WAPLS model for determining the optimum transfer function and for detecting large-residual samples, and the final transfer function was generated after removing the large-residual samples from the first screened dataset. The final dataset for MSP and MJaT consists of 428 and 419 samples, respectively. The root mean square errors of prediction for both WAPLS models are 34 mm and 2.7 degrees C, and the coefficients of determination are 0.85 and 0.73. This study suggests that the values of climatic parameters could be better estimated and the reliability of pollen-climate transfer functions would be significantly improved through removing anomalous and large-residual samples from the original dataset with mathematical methods.

AB  - The main question addressed by this article is how to adapt the responsive evaluation (RE) approach to an intervention context characterized by repetition of ineffective interventions, ambiguous intervention action theories among stakeholders, and high complexity. The context is Grand-Popo, a fishing municipality located on Benin's southwest Atlantic coast. The fishery management interventionists and the fishing communities in the municipality all espoused concern for the sustainable improvement of fishing actors' livelihood conditions, but differed about the reasons for this livelihood impairment, and about what should be done, when, where, and by whom. Given this ambiguity, we identified RE as a promising action research approach to facilitate dialogue and mutual learning, and consequently to improve stakeholders' ability to resolve problems. However, this approach seems to have some shortcomings in the Grand-Popo context, regarding the repetitive ineffectiveness of interventions, high complexity, and uncertainty. Therefore, based on our empirical study, we add three dimensions to the existing RE framework: historical analysis to deal with routine interventions, exploration and discussion of incongruities of action theories to trigger double-loop learning, and system analysis to deal with complexity and uncertainty. This article does not intend to address the implications or impact of this adapted RE framework. Instead, we suggest some criteria and indicators for evaluating whether the proposed amended RE approach has assisted in resolving the fishery problems in Grand-Popo after the approach has been applied.

However, differences in management recommendations and manure application guidelines for similar field conditions among state P Indices, coupled with minimal reductions in the extent of P-impaired surface waters and soil test P (STP) levels, led the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to revise the 590 Nutrient Management Standard. In preparation for this revision, NRCS requested that a review of the scientific underpinnings and accuracy of current P Indices be undertaken. They also sought to standardize the interpretation and management implications of P Indices, including establishment of ratings above which P applications should be curtailed. Although some states have initiated STP thresholds above which no application of P is allowed, STP alone cannot define a site's risk of P loss. Phosphorus Indices are intended to account for all of the major factors leading to P loss. A rigorous evaluation of P Indices is needed to determine if they are directionally and magnitudinally correct. Although use of observed P loss data under various management scenarios is ideal, such data are spatially and temporally limited. Alternatively, the use of a locally validated water quality model that has been shown to provide accurate estimates of P loss may be the most expedient option to conduct Index assessments in the short time required by the newly revised 590 Standard.

AB  - Iron, manganese, copper, lead and cadmium were measured in the livers, muscles, kidneys and bones of Eurasian Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo), Brown Hawk Owls (Nixos scutulata) and Collared Scops Owls (Otus lempiji) from Korea. Iron concentrations by tissue within species did not differ, but there were significant differences among tissues across all species. Manganese and copper concentrations in muscles, kidneys and bones, but not livers, differed among species and also differed among tissues in the three owl species. We suggest that manganese and copper concentrations from this study were far below the level associated with their toxicity. Lead concentrations significantly differed among all species for livers and bones, and among tissues for each species. Cadmium concentrations were significantly different among species for all tissues and among tissues in Eurasian Eagle Owls and Collared Scops Owls. For most samples, lead concentrations in livers and bones, and cadmium in livers and kidneys, were within the background levels for wild birds. For some Eurasian Eagle Owls and Collared Scops Owls, lead concentrations were at an acute exposure level, whilst lead concentrations were at a chronic exposure level in Brown Hawk Owls. Cadmium concentrations were at a chronic exposure level in all three owl species. Acute and chronic poisoning was significantly correlated between indicator tissues. We suggest that lead and cadmium contamination in Eurasian Eagle Owls may reflect a Korean source, Brown Hawk Owls may reflect Korean and wintering sites, and Collared Scops Owls may reflect breeding and/or wintering sites.

AB  - The aim of this study was to apply a global sensitivity analysis (SA) method in model simplification and to evaluate (eO)(R), a biological Time Temperature Integrator (TTI) as a quality and safety indicator for cold smoked salmon (CSS). Models were thus developed to predict the evolutions of Listeria monocytogenes and the indigenous food flora in CSS and to predict TTIs endpoint. A global SA was then applied on the three models to identify the less important factors and simplify the models accordingly. Results showed that the subset of the most important factors of the three models was mainly composed of the durations and temperatures of two chill chain links, out of the control of the manufacturers: the domestic refrigerator and the retail/cabinet links. Then, the simplified versions of the three models were run with 10(4) time temperature profiles representing the variability associated to the microbial behavior, to the TTIs evolution and to the French chill chain characteristics. The results were used to assess the distributions of the microbial contaminations obtained at the TTI endpoint and at the end of the simulated profiles and proved that, in the case of poor storage conditions, the TTI use could reduce the number of unacceptable foods by 50%.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1694 for the determination of pharmaceuticals in water recently brought a new challenge for treatment utilities, where pharmaceuticals have been reported in the drinking water of 41-million Americans. This proposed methodology, designed to address this important issue, consists of solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) using triple quadrupole. Under the guidelines of Method 1694, a multi-residue method was developed, validated, and applied to wastewater, surface water and drinking water samples for the analysis of 70 pharmaceuticals. Four distinct chromatographic gradients and LC conditions were used according to the polarity and extraction of the different pharmaceuticals. Positive and negative ion electrospray were used with two MRM transitions (a quantifier and a qualifier ion for each compound), which adds extra confirmation not included in the original Method 1694. Finally, we verify, for the first time, EPA Method 1694 on water samples collected in several locations in Colorado, where positive identifications for several pharmaceuticals were found. This study is a valuable indicator of the potential of LC/MS-MS for routine quantitative multi-residue analysis of pharmaceuticals in drinking water and wastewater samples and will make monitoring studies much easier to develop for water utilities across the US, who are currently seeking guidance on analytical methods for pharmaceuticals in their water supplies.

AB  - The spatial resolution of General Circulation Models (GCMs) is too coarse to represent regional climate changes at the scales required for environmental impact assessment. Therefore, downscaling of precipitation and temperature has to be carried out from the GCM grids to smaller scales of a few square kilometres. Daily precipitation and temperature are modelled as stochastic processes coupled to atmospheric circulation. Precipitation is linked to circulation patterns (CPS) using conditional model parameters. Temperature is modelled using a simple autoregressive model conditioned on atmospheric circulation and local daily precipitation. The models use an automated objective classification of daily atmospheric circulation patterns based on optimized fuzzy rules. Both temperature and precipitation are downscaled to several locations taking into account the CP dependent spatial correlation. The models were applied to the Mesochora medium-sized mountainous catchment in Central Greece for validation using observed precipitation and temperature and observed classified geo-potential heights (at 700 hPa). GCM scenarios of the ECHAM4 model for 1xCO(2) and 2xCO(2) cases were used to make climate change predictions (by using classified GCM geopotential heights). Simulated values agree fairly well with historical data. Most of the GCM results (incl. mean daily values, renewal process probabilities, spell lengths) under the 2xCO(2) case reflect a somewhat wetter and a more variable precipitation regime over the Mesochora catchment with significantly increased daily mean temperatures.

AB  - Demands for public outdoor recreation and urbanization are a potential source of environmental disturbances, particularly on sandy beaches. These habitats have therefore experienced rapid degradation worldwide. Talitrid amphipods, which are common inhabitants of sandy beaches, are probably good indicators of such disturbances. In this study, we evaluated the responses of the two amphipods Talitrus saltator and Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis to human pressure on Spanish and a Brazilian beach, hypothesizing that disregarding species differences, their population sizes will decline under urbanized conditions. The Barra da Tijuca (Brazil) and Levante (Spain) beaches have mixed landscapes with varying levels of development, and each has a protected area (MPA) adjacent to urbanized sites. Numbers of talitrids as well as visitors were compared among sites on each beach. Talitrids were most abundant at the protected sites. This was true of both beaches, even though temporal patterns of human activity were quite different, with Levante experiencing sharp declines in the number of visitors during its harsh winter. Urbanized sites did not experience high Talitrid densities even during a period of low human pressure. On this basis, T. saltator and A. brasiliensis were considered good indicators of urbanization and recreational activities on sandy beaches. MPAs were found to be very important for the successful conservation of the talitrid populations. A feasible method of managing human pressure and thereby conserving beach biodiversity therefore seems to be the establishment of beach MPAs.

AB  - The present work is designed to study diversity of five insect orders (viz., Hemiptera, Orthoptera, aculeate Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera) in the industrial region of Haldia (India) and in non-industrial area of the same district and to evaluate the impact of industrialization on the biodiversity of those insect orders. The objective also extended to find out the possibility of existence of bioindicator, if any. Eight study sites were selected from the East part of Midnapur district covering 40 km aerial distance. Out of eight different study sites, five were distributed in and around Haldia industrial complex and three in industry-free area. During this study, a total of 120 species under 98 genera in 37 families of insects were collected. Binary data of 5 orders revealed that the species richness of Hemiptera, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera is higher in non-industrial zone in comparison to that of industrial zone. Aculeate Hymenoptera shows no particular trend whereas Coleoptera shows higher species richness in industrial areas. Results of multivariate analyses are compared with the species richness data for all the eight study sites. It is concluded that even in an apparently homogeneous ecological condition species richness may drastically change with the influence of industries. Total insect fauna decline by at least 23.33% is noticed in industrial areas. It is found that some species of lepidopteran, hemipteran and orthopteran insects are susceptible to industrial pollution and some of the members of these orders may be considered as a bioindicator group.

LA  - English
AB  - Usefulness of the synergistic haemolysis (CAMP-like) test in the identification of Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, and Aeromonas caviae was evaluated, using beta-toxin producing Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and alpha-toxin producing Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124 as sphingomyelinase producing indicator strains. The tests were done on Columbia Blood Agar Base supplemented with 5% sheep blood (CBA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA). When cultured aerobically, 77% of A. hydrophila isolates, 75% of A. sobria isolates, and 23% of A. caviae isolates elicited synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes with the beta-toxin producing strain of S. aureus. Anaerobically, using the same indicator strain, synergistic haemolysis was given by 91%, 51% and 82% of A. hydrophila, A. sobria, and A. caviae, respectively. When a-toxin producing C. perfringens was used in the test instead of beta-toxin producing S. aureus, 100%, 86%, and 93% of A. hydrophila, A. sobria, and A. caviae isolates, respectively, showed synergistic haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. Due to the high number of the tested isolates of A. hydrophila, A. sobria, and A. caviae giving a positive synergistic haemolysis reaction in both atmospheric conditions of culture, this test cannot be used to identify any oi the three Aeromonas spp. The use of a-toxin producing C. perfringens did not improve discriminatory power of the test. Because the nature of the product of Aeromonas spp. responsible for the lyric phenomenon is not known, the use of Aeromonas factor and synergistic haemolysis terms was proposed rather than CAMP (reaction, test) or CAMP (-like) factor.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread skeletal condition in the historical population, but it still raises many methodological and interpretative problems. The present study aimed to examine the osteoarthritic changes (osteophytes, porosity, eburnation) in the skeletal material from Radom (14th-19th century) (Poland), enriching knowledge about osteoarthritis and its prevalence in the past. Additionally, a comparison of OA changes prevalence in two chronological periods (the population from Radom during the 14th-17th century versus the 18th-19th century) was done. In the Late Medieval (14th-17th century) population from Radom, osteoarthritic changes were observed in 22% of individuals (males, 18%; females, 29%) and in the Modern Period Radom (18th-19th century) in 25% individuals (males, 25.7%; females, 26.5%). In both skeletal samples, the greatest number of OA changes was recorded in the hip and elbow. Knee and ankle were the least affected joints. Osteophytes were the most frequently observed type of lesions, while eburnation was the least frequent. Although the higher prevalence of osteoarthritis in the Modern Period in Radom is noted, the differences are not statistically significant. Taking the multifactorial etiology of osteoarthritic changes, and the fact that osteoarthritis, as a single indicator of health, could not tell much about the overall lifestyle of past human populations, one must be caution when drawing unambiguous conclusions according to the simple, linear effect of environmental changes on osteoarthritic changes formation.

AB  - Place-based structural inequalities can have critical implications for the health of vulnerable populations. Historical urban policies, such as redlining, have contributed to current inequalities in exposure to intra-urban heat. However, it is unknown whether these spatial inequalities are associated with disparities in heat-related health outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine the relationships between historical redlining, intra-urban heat conditions, and heat-related emergency department visits using data from 11 Texas cities. At the zip code level, the proportion of historical redlining was determined, and heat exposure was measured using daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST). Heat-related inpatient and outpatient rates were calculated based on emergency department visit data that included ten categories of heat-related diseases between 2016 and 2019. Regression or spatial error/lag models revealed significant associations between higher proportions of redlined areas in the neighborhood and higher LST (Coef. = 0.0122, 95% CI = 0.0039-0.0205). After adjusting for indicators of social vulnerability, neighborhoods with higher proportions of redlining showed significantly elevated heat-related outpatient visit rate (Coef. = 0.0036, 95% CI = 0.0007-0.0066) and inpatient admission rate (Coef. = 0.0018, 95% CI = 0.0001-0.0035). These results highlight the role of historical discriminatory policies on the disparities of heat-related illness and suggest a need for equity-based urban heat planning and management strategies.

AB  - The shales of Sekuliye Formation were investigated to interpret their provenance history, weathering, and tectonic setting based on major and trace element geochemistry. The major and trace element geochemistry revealed derivation of the shales from felsic igneous rocks with little influence from intermediate igneous rocks and quartzose sedimentary rocks. Weathering proxies such as plagioclase index of alteration (PIA), chemical index of alteration (CIA), index of chemical variability (ICV) and Rb/Sr ratios show that the source rock undergoes high degree of chemical weathering activities. Also, the plot CIA vs. ICV shows that all the studied shales were plotted below Post Archean Australian Shale. The ICV value of 0.85 also indicates high intensity of weathering activities in the provenance area. The paleoclimatic indicators (C values and Sr/Cu) and some trace elements ratios (Ni/Co and Cu/Zn) displayed deposition under humid conditions and oxic depositional environment, respectively. The Sr/Ba ratios revealed high salinity during the deposition of the studied shale, reflecting a marine depositional environment. Through geochemical studies, these sediments were classified as shales that are texturally immature and compositionally matured. The geochemical data plotted on tectonic setting discriminant function diagrams suggested a continental rift of passive margin settings. Accordingly, the inferred tectonic settings are comparable to the accepted model on the origin and evolution of the Benue Trough.

AB  - Morphological and elemental composition of otoliths are a promising tool for fish stock identification. In this regard, European eel has not been sufficiently researched. The aim of this study was to determine otolith shape index values and microchemistry composition of 14 elements in otoliths of European eel between riverine and lacustrine stocks from the Adriatic Basin in Croatia and Montenegro. In terms of morphometry, the shape indices, form factor and cir-cularity of the sagittal otolith were statistically different between lacustrine and riverine stocks. The European eel is considered to have a small otolith relative size. Canonical variate analysis indicated no statistical differences among the concentrations of trace elements in sagittal otoliths between riverine and lacustrine stocks. However, constrained redundancy analysis suggested a stronger relationship of width, total length, females and the silver stage with the Sr/Ca, Cr/Ca, Ba/Ca and K/Ca ratios of specimens from riverine than lacustrine habitats. Gender and stage dependent variations showed that females were better indicators of relationships between microchemistry composition and intrinsic factors. In conclusion, form factor and circularity of the sagittal otolith was able to distin-guish between European eel stocks from different habitats. Also, it seems that the European eels' otolith fingerprint is homogenous, species specific and independent of ecological conditions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial impervious surfaces are one of the most significant factors contributing to urban heat islands (UHIs). Adapting to UHIs is a challenge in achieving thermal comfort. We conducted a quantitative and subjective evaluation of a closely paved novel water-retaining pavement (WR) and a conventional dense-asphalt pavement (AS). We investigated the thermal states of humans based on the human energy balance known as "human thermal load" as an indicator for the assessment, and the original human thermal load method was improved for assessing nonuniform environments such as pavements. We looked for individual thermal perceptions simultaneously. The experiment was conducted in typical summer weather. The surface temperature of the WR was found to be significantly lower, by 9.5 degrees C, while the air temperature and humidity above both pavements were not significantly different. Thus, air conditions did not directly affect the sensible and latent heat loss. The reflected solar radiation was significantly larger, and the infrared radiation was significantly smaller on the WR than on the AS due to the lower surface temperature from the water evaporation and higher reflectance. Further, the human thermal load at a pedestrian level of 1.5 m was found to be significantly different: 237 W/m(2) for AS and 215 W/m(2) for WR. In a subjective evaluation, the perceptions of WR tend to be distributed in smaller human thermal load, thereby resulting in a cooler and comfortable sensation. Therefore, we demonstrated that when compared to AS, WR significantly improves thermal comfort.

TI  - Double strand breaks (DSBs) as indicators of genomic instability in PATRR-mediated translocations
T2  - HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
LA  - English
AB  - Genomic instability contributes to a variety of potentially damaging conditions, including DNA-based rearrangements. Breakage in the form of double strand breaks (DSBs) increases the likelihood of DNA damage, mutations and translocations. Certain human DNA regions are known to be involved in recurrent translocations, such as the palindrome-mediated rearrangements that have been identified at the breakpoints of several recurrent constitutional translocations: t(11;22)(q23;q11), t(17;22)(q11;q11) and t(8;22) (q24;q11). These breakpoints occur at the center of palindromic AT-rich repeats (PATRRs), which suggests that the structure of the DNA may play a contributory role, potentially through the formation of secondary cruciform structures. The current study analyzed the DSB propensity of these PATRR regions in both lymphoblastoid (mitotic) and spermatogenic cells (meiotic). Initial results found an increased association of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) at PATRR regions in experiments that used SCEs to assay DSBs, combining SCE staining with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Additional experiments used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with antibodies for either markers of DSBs or proteins involved in DSB repair along with quantitative polymerase chain reaction to quantify the frequency of DSBs occurring at PATRR regions. The results indicate an increased rate of DSBs at PATRR regions. Additional ChIP experiments with the cruciform binding 2D3 antibody indicate an increased rate of cruciform structures at PATRR regions in both mitotic and meiotic samples. Overall, these experiments demonstrate an elevated rate of DSBs at PATRR regions, an indication that the structure of PATRR containing DNA may lead to increased breakage in multiple cellular environments.

AB  - Health impact assessment (HIA) is internationally identified as a mechanism for ensuring that potential health impacts of project proposals are considered before project implementation. This study examined the inclusion of HIAs in environmental impact statement (EIS) and their translation into planning obligations of a dam project in Lesotho. A framework premised on the general systems theory, and integrating EIS contents, environmental management plans and monitoring obligations in post dam construction was used as the analytic lens. A review of the EIS was conducted to assess HIAs covered during the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the dam. Data drawn from selected household questionnaire interviews and analysis of related documents was used to assess the extent of HIA mainstreaming into planning and monitoring obligations in post dam construction. Results showed inclusion of HIAs in EIS, including endemic diseases such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS, acute respiratory infections, pharyngitis, hypertension, influenza and diarrhea. Social, economic and environmental conditions were identified as major determinants of health; while mental and nutritional determinants of health were less discussed. The results also showed that some HIAs included in EIS influenced decision-making in relation to raising awareness of health issues in the community. Deficiencies were however reported by respondents in relation to mainstreaming of several HIA recommendations. HIAs can be useful in promoting community health and mitigating adverse impacts of decisions made by project proponents.

AB  - The object of our study is devoted to the Spermatophyta of the wetlands of Oued Larbaa, the main river of the city of Taza, Morocco, and which is under strong anthropic pressure. Our work involved a floristic inventory, to define ecological types and groups of dominant plants in relation to seasonal factors and types of pollution, explaining the meaning of their presence. For this purpose, floristic sampling was carried out along the Oued during the dry periods (2017 and 2018) and the wet period (2018). A total of 66 plant species belonging to 54 genera and 30 families were identified, including 44 species during the wet period (2018) and 27 species during the dry periods (2017 and 2018). This difference is due to the favorable conditions for vegetation development during the period of precipitation and to the increase in pollution rates during the dry season. The inventoried flora shows the dominance of 10 ecological types characterized by the following plants: Cynodon dactylon, Arundo donax, Olea europaea, and Tamarix gallica (common between the two periods); Dittrichia viscosa, Visnaga daucoides, Typha angustifolia, and Ricinus communis (during the dry periods of 2017 and 2018); and Juncus maritimus and Populus nigra (during the wet period of 2018). The ecological types identified in this work decrease from the dry season to the rainy season, while specific richness increases. These dominant plants are all considered as bioindicators of the presence of heavy metals.

AB  - During the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene time, a widespread sedimentary organic-rich succession developed throughout the middle latitudes of Egypt. Since the study area conserves the organic-rich intervals three shallow boreholes were drilled through the Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene succession on the southern Tethys margin of Egypt. This work employs complete unpublished inorganic and organic geochemical data of 368 metric core samples to construct the chemostratigraphic framework of the studied sedimentary sequence. The paleoenvironmental conditions that prevailed at the time of deposition were discussed. A total of 368 samples were analyzed for 52 major and trace elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and for organic carbon concentrations by LECO C230 combustion furnace.
   The statistical treatment suggested five influential controlling factors during the deposition of the studied sedimentary succession. These factors express the influence of the terrestrial controls, phosphorite, anoxia, argillaceous marine sediments and/or marine shale and earliest diagenesis, in descending order of their relative strength. According to the microscopic examination supported by the chemical composition of the major oxides, seven lithofacies were defined; carbonate (limestone), dolomitized rocks, argillaceous limestone (marlstone), calcareous shale, siltstone-mudstone, phosphorites, and phosphatic rocks. Moreover, the diagnostic trace element content of each geological formation was assessed. Some of the obtained geochemical features were adopted as reliable chemostratigraphic indicators and to discriminate among the different depositional environments of the studied sequence.

AB  - This study was performed to investigate the presence of histamine forming bacteria in commercially available cheeses as well as to evaluate the histamine forming potential using in vitro models. Five long-time-ripened cheeses made from different milk types were analysed for histamine producing bacterial isolates. The ability of the isolates to produce histamine was tested by incubation at 37 degrees C for five days in a restricted media with a pH indicator. Changes in the amino-compound profile were investigated using ultra performance liquid chromatography. Only eight of 106 isolates were able to produce compounds raising the pH and seven of those were confirmed to be histamine producers. Despite the fact that all isolates were obtained from the same vintage Danish Gouda cheese, made from raw cow milk, the amino-compound profile as well as the response to different environmental conditions diverged between the isolates. Rep-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to further characterize the isolates. Pediococcus pentosaceus was for the first time reported to be a histamine producer in cheese. The presence of the histidine decarboxylase gene (hdcA) was confirmed by PCR amplification of the histidine decarboxylase gene in four of the isolates. The results indicate that evaluating the presence and concentration of histamine is not only a relevant parameter to evaluate quality and safety, but is also an important tool to classify histamine producers in cheese.

AB  - Chinese society's unique characteristics present challenges with regard to discovering new ways to tackle tremendous environmental problems. This paper examines the effect of provincial social capital on environmental performance in China. In the first stage of the analysis, we measured the environmental performance levels of the 2011-2017 panel data of 30 provinces in China. We did this using data envelopment analysis (DEA). After introducing the concept of social capital, we innovatively built the social capital index system based on China's national conditions and measured social capital data from three perspectives. Then, we used the Probit regression model to explore the effect of social capital on environmental performance. The results show that the environmental performance of the well-known and better developed regions of China (such as Beijing, Shanghai, etc.) is significantly higher than other regions. Social capital and environmental performance are related in general. However, the effect of social capital on environmental performance is heterogeneous in different regions. They are more consistent in the eastern and southwest regions but are less stable in other regions. Among the three types of social capital, structural capital has the most obvious benefits for environmental performance. This is followed by relational capital and innovative capital. Furthermore, it has been found that the proportion of the tertiary industry in GDP and the level of social trust are the largest indicators of the rates at which structural capital and relational capital contribute, respectively, to environmental performance.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a key climate change gas and nitrifying microbes living in terrestrial ecosystems contribute significantly to its formation. Many soils are acidic and global change will cause acidification of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but the effect of decreasing pH on N2O formation by nitrifiers is poorly understood. Here, we used isotope-ratio mass spectrometry to investigate the effect of acidification on production of N2O by pure cultures of two ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA; Nitrosocosmicus oleophilus and Nitrosotenuis chungbukensis) and an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium (AOB; Nitrosomonas europaea). For all three strains acidification led to increased emission of N2O. However, changes of N-15 site preference (SP) values within the N2O molecule (as indicators of pathways for N2O formation), caused by decreasing pH, were highly different between the tested AOA and AOB. While acidification decreased the SP value in the AOB strain, SP values increased to a maximum value of 29 parts per thousand in N. oleophilus. In addition, N-15-nitrite tracer experiments showed that acidification boosted nitrite transformation into N2O in all strains, but the incorporation rate was different for each ammonia oxidizer. Unexpectedly, for N. oleophilus more than 50% of the N2O produced at pH 5.5 had both nitrogen atoms from nitrite and we demonstrated that under these conditions expression of a putative cytochrome P450 NO reductase is strongly upregulated. Collectively, our results indicate that N. oleophilus might be able to enzymatically denitrify nitrite to N2O at low pH.

AB  - Selecting suitable plant species is important in urban greening because urban environments often provide unfavorable conditions for plant growth. We focused on delayed fluorescence (DF), i.e., light emitted from plants immediately following light exposure as a result of back electron transfer in photosynthesis, as an indicator of photosynthetic activity. Moss greening, urban greening using bryophytes, has attracted attention as a new domain of greening that does not require soil. Therefore, tolerance to drying, which is a characteristic environmental factor in cities, of four bryophytes-Bryum argenteum Hedw., Racomitrium japonicum Dozy et Molk., Hypnum plumaeforme Wilson, and Polytrichum commune Hedw.-was evaluated in the laboratory using DF. Assuming an urban environment, experiments were performed to measure the transition of DF following the cessation of irrigation and re-watering. The recovery of accumulated DF values ( 0-200 s) by rehydration 8 days after irrigation cessation was increased in the order H. plumaeforme approximate to P. commune < R. japonicum < B. argenteum. B. argenteum presented an increase in the accumulated amount of DF 8 h after irrigation cessation, and presented a significantly higher DF when compared with the other three species at 16 h. Together with results of previous studies, these findings of desiccation tolerance in the studied species indicate that DF is a useful method for characterizing desiccation tolerance in plants and selecting potentially useful plants for urban greening.

AB  - With rapid industrialization and urbanization, regional water shortages and water quality deterioration have posed great challenges for the sustainable development of cities in North China, especially those with a large demand for agricultural irrigation water. Based on an input-output analysis, this paper develops a dynamic optimization model consisting of three sub-models and multiple constraint conditions to solve the water crisis of Baoding, a typical city experiencing water shortages and serious water pollution in North China. The water resource carrying capacity (WRCC) indicator is introduced in the analysis of the results to comprehensively assess the effect of integrated water environmental policies (IWEPs) from 2013 to 2025. In the optimal scenario, the annual chemical oxygen demand (COD) discharge and annual water demand in Baoding can be reduced by 2.6% and 0.6%, respectively, with an annual gross regional product (GRP) growth rate of 7.52%. The WRCC can be improved from moderately overloaded to weakly unsaturated, which indicates that water resources can meet the socioeconomic development requirements. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the linear optimization model with input-output analysis in coordinating the relationships among water demand, water environment protection, and economic development, and the IWEPs provide an applicable reference for decision-makers in Baoding and other similar cities in North China to address deteriorating water systems.

AB  - Oxygen-18 and deuterium analyses of water samples are provided from a regional survey of lakes, wetlands, soil waters, groundwaters, and snowpack samples collected in the Southern Athabasca Oil Sands (SAOS) region, Alberta, Canada, mainly during 2007-2009. Lake, wetland, and river sampling were conducted by helicopter during late summer, capturing conditions close to peak evaporative enrichment. Shallow soil water from the unsaturated zone was also collected in late summer, whereas deeper groundwaters from Quaternary aquifers, Quaternary channels, and uppermost Cretaceous strata, were collected primarily as part of winter drilling programs by industrial partners. Snowpack samples were collected in late March/early April, prior to significant spring melt. This dataset includes 1576 isotopic analyses made on 788 water samples as well as selected isotope mass balance model outputs (lake evaporation/inflow and water yield to lakes). These basic model data are provided to facilitate evaluation of the method as a tool for spatial mapping of water yield and its interannual variability. Details and further discussion on the isotope mass balance approach are provided in "Mapping water yield distribution across the southern Athabasca Oil Sands area: baseline surveys applying isotope mass balance of lakes" (Gibson et al., 2019). Overall, the data are expected to be useful, in comparison with local and regional datasets, for water resource management and planning, including design of monitoring networks and environmental impact assessments for oil sands projects.

AB  - For the purpose of offering a detailed atmospheric pollution control strategy to the Hangzhou government to make the major atmospheric pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10) meet the environmental regulation aim required by the 13th Five Year Plan of Hangzhou, the WRF/CMAQ model is used to simulate the pollution level over Hangzhou. Observed data from five local environmental monitoring stations in the downtown Hangzhou are selected to evaluate the performance of simulation. The indicator factors confirm the accuracy of the WRF/CMAQ modeling system. Results show the local emission sources account for 15.8%, 68.6%, 48.3% and 59.2% of the overall SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10, concentration in 2017, respectively. And the research on the separate local sectors indicates traffic donates 71.6% of local NO2 emission while industry contributes 73.8%, 53.2% and 56.7% of the total local emission of SO2, PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The more severe pollution during the wintertime was mainly due to low we deposition, low temperature, low wind speed, prevailing wind direction, the condition of local deciduous plants and urban heat island. If the local traffic and industry are cut down by 6% and 10%, respectively, the air pollution control targets on SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10, in 2020 can be hit.

AB  - Aim. To undertake an analysis of the actual status of small innovative enterprises (SIE) in the field of environmental protection created by universities within the framework of programs to develop innovation activity infrastructure and to identify their key operational challenges and the main directions to improve their efficiency.
   Materials and Methods. In the course of the research, data on registered SIE were used which were contained in the database of notifications of their establishment (website: https://mip.extech.ru), as well as survey data obtained during the monitoring of the activities of SIE created by state institutions of education and science for the practical application of results of intellectual activity. Methods of analysis and synthesis as well as systematic, statistical and research survey methods were used.
   Results. A study was made of the information provided by institutions of higher education through surveys of conditions of SIE activities in the field of environmental protection. The main indicators of the SIEs in the field of environmental protection active in 2017 were identified and analyzed - revenue, profit, type of activity and number of recorded results of innovation activity. In the process of analyzing the survey data a number of problems were revealed which hamper effective SIE operations, the solution of which would involve changes in current legislation. The study of proposals of institutions of higher education to improve SIE activities has made it possible to identify key areas for the development of innovative entrepreneurship.

AB  - A good and safe workplace is a big challenge for the business community. Different stakeholder groups are placing pressure on firms to demonstrate their commitment to the continual improvement of working conditions. In the light of society's demands, firms design and implement Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) actions as an integral part of the general corporate strategy and they also use various communication channels to inform stakeholders about OHS performance. CSR reporting is a popular communication tool whereby stakeholders can be informed about firms' performance in various aspects of corporate social responsibility. However, a standard accounting methodology to evaluate non-financial information, such as OHS information, does not yet exist. Such a methodology would help managers and stakeholder assess the effectiveness of the OHS management practices adopted by firms. After considering the above weakness, this paper proposes an assessment methodology of OHS information disclosed in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Based on GRI indicators, this methodology develops an objective scoring system which evaluates the quality and type of OHS information. The proposed methodology was used to investigate the OHS disclosing practices from an international sample of firms assessing the impact of various factors on the quality of the OHS information. In a nutshell, the quality of the OHS disclosures was very poor. The factors which influence the quality of OHS reporting practices are the industry sector, the continent in which firms operate and the OHSAS certification.

AB  - In the Baiyun Sag, the oil relationship with possible source rocks is complicated, and little research on oil sources in the area has been performed. In this paper, geochemical studies of carbon isotopes, biomarkers, paleoenvironmental deposition, and crude oil maturity, earned out with the use of oil samples from the Baiyun Sag, demonstrate that the organic matter in crude oil has an oxidizing depositional environment and primarily lacustrine facies conditions, with a significantly higher plant input. The oil samples used are mature to highly mature. Crude oil in the northern area of the Baiyun Sag is more mature than samples in the eastern part of the sag. Despite limited source rock data, we were able to conclude that the crude oil samples were derived mainly from the Enping Formation; other potential source rocks of the Wenchang and Zhuhai Formations may also have contributed to the reservoirs in different parts of the sag. Furthermore, the source of crude oil in each structure in the Baiyun Sag was analyzed; for example, crude oil in the LH19-5 structure was generated from the organic matter of the Enping Formation, and crude oil in the LW3-1 structure was derived from the mixed organic matter of the Enping, Wenchang, and Zhuhai Formations.

AB  - South Asia experienced a weakening of summer monsoon circulation in the past several decades, resulting in rainfall decline in wet regions. In comparison with other tropical ecosystems, quantitative assessments of the extent and triggers of vegetation change are lacking in assessing climate-change impacts over South Asia dominated by crops. Here, we use satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to quantify spatial-temporal changes in vegetation greenness, and find a widespread annual greening trend that stands in contrast to the weakening of summer monsoon circulation particularly over the last decade. We further show that moisture supply is the primary factor limiting vegetation activity during dry season or in dry region, and cloud cover or temperature would become increasingly important in wet region. Enhanced moisture conditions over dry region, coinciding with the decline in monsoon, are mainly responsible for the widespread greening trend. This result thereby cautions the use of a unified monsoon index to predict South Asia's vegetation dynamics. Current climate-carbon models in general correctly reproduce the dominant control of moisture in the temporal characteristics of vegetation productivity. But the model ensemble cannot exactly reproduce the spatial pattern of satellite-based vegetation change mainly because of biases in climate simulations. The moisture-induced greening over South Asia, which is likely to persist into the wetter future, has significant implications for regional carbon cycling and maintaining food security.

AB  - The present paper sought compare the environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of biodiesel production obtained from the two raw materials most used in Brazil (soybean oil and beef tallow) through the process ethyl transesterification in an alkaline medium. The reference flow adopted for the work was the generation of power supplied 1GJ from the produced biodiesel. The data used in the inventory life cycle were calculated based on similar scientific papers. The method of assessment of environmental impacts chosen was the CML 2001 modified. Altogether, it were analyzed nine categories of environmental impacts for both processes (abiotic depletion (kg Sb eq), land use (m2a), global warming (kg CO2 eq), ozone layer depletion (kg CFC-11 eq), human toxicity (kg 1,4-DB eq), freshwater ecotoxicity (kg 1, 4-DB eq), terrestrial ecotoxicity (kg 1, 4-DB eq), acidification (kg SO2 eq) and eutrophication (kg PO43- eq)). The results of evaluation of environmental impacts show that the biodiesel production process from soybean oil presents major environmental damage in seven categories of analyzed impacts (destruction of abiotic resources, destruction of the ozone layer, human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication). The production process of biodiesel from tallow presents major environmental damage in two categories of impacts analyzed (land use and global warming). However, the results show that the absolute values of environmental damage caused by impacts of the production process using beef tallow are much more aggressive.

AB  - An electrical impedance spectroscopy fouling monitor (EISFM) was used to monitor the performance of a reverse osmosis (RO) treatment train in a NEWater plant in Singapore. A 'canary cell' equipped with an EIS measurement system was installed in a side stream of the train. It was operated at the same hydrodynamics as the train to simulate the fouling conditions in the spiral wound modules. The correlation between the EISFM response and plant performance was investigated. When trending the real part of the impedance Of the low frequency signal element (Z(real_DP)) over time, there was a maximum in the normalised Z(real-DP) observed well before chemical cleaning which was indicated by the traditional operational criteria. The occurrence of Z(real-DP) peaks can be used as an indicator to initiate mitigation measures, such as adjustment of flux or crossflow velocity. As such, the frequency of chemical CIPs could be reduced. Furthermore, by obsenting the trend of Z(real-DP) over time, it was possible to identify the nature of the fouling such as the build-up of a layer of inorganic colloids. This was validated by membrane autopsy studies. This study confirms that the EISFM is suitable for monitoring the performance of RO in a real plant. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study we assessed the small-scale effects of submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) on macrofaunal assemblages associated with shallow sandy sediments along the south coast of Portugal. Corer samples were collected in a (1) subtidal seep, (2) at the edge of the seep (periphery) and (3) in the surrounding area. Community structure varied across areas, with diversity, species richness and evenness generally low at seep relatively to the surrounding area. Community composition within the seep was reduced to a small number of taxa, although total abundance was similar between seeps and surrounding areas. The seep was characterized by a distinct hydrological environment, with lower salinity and pH, relative to the surroundings sandy areas. More than 93% of the benthic macrofauna in the seep was dominated by Lumbricillus lineatus (enchytraeid oligochaetes). This study is the first to record the presence of this euryaline species in Portuguese marine waters. In the surrounding area Spionidae Polychaetes and Bathyporeia sp. (Amphipoda) were the most frequent and abundant taxa. These findings provide evidence for a direct association between SGD effect and the composition of benthic marine assemblages. The patchy habitat created by groundwater seep allowed euryhaline species with short and fast recruitment times to occur in a fully marine environment. Whether this pattern is consistent, or only occurs when smooth favorable sea conditions are not superimposed on the groundwater effect remains uncertain. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Palynological, palaeoparasitological and paleobotanical studies of coprolites found in archaeological sites from Perito Moreno National Park (47 degrees 57'S72 degrees 05'W) yielded information on diet, palaeoenvironment and health. These studies allowed adding evidence to the reconstruction of life history of the hunter -gatherers that inhabited Patagonia during the Holocene. We examined the season of the year when camelid Lama guanicoe coprolites (5400 +/- 64 yr C-14 BP to 9640 +/- 190 yr C-14 BP) were deposited at Cerro Casa de Piedra 7 (site CCP7). The study used palynological evidence and comparison with pollen spectra of modern feces collected during summer, fall, winter and spring of 2010. The dominant types were: pollen of Nothofagus, Empetrum rubrum, Asteraceae subfam. Asteroideae, Nassauvia, Caryophyllaceae and Poaceae; fern spores; remains of Eimeria macusaniensis; and plant remains of Poaceae, Festuca pallescens, Stipa speciosa, Armeria maritima, Gaultheria mucronata and E. rubrum. Pollen spectra of modern and fossil feces were used for multivariate analysis. Coprolites associated to fall and winter modern feces. These results and those obtained from pollen concentration values and the presence of pollen types indicators of seasonality, allowed the determination of summer, fall and winter coprolites. However, caution must be taken with the seasonality results of coprolites dated earlier than 9000 years BP since the environmental conditions differed from now. The site was probably a camelid shelter during the unfavorable seasons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofouling is a major problem for long-term deployment of sensors in the marine environment. This study showed that significant biofilm formation occurred on a variety of artificial materials (glass, copper, Delrin and poly-methyl methacrylate [PMMA]) deployed for 10days at a depth of 4700m in the Cayman Trough. Biofilm surface coverage was used as an indicator of biomass. The lowest biofilm coverage was on copper and PMMA. Molecular analyses indicated that bacteria dominated the biofilms found on copper, Delrin and PMMA with 75, 55 and 73% coverage, respectively. Archea (66%) were dominant on the glass surface simulating interior sensor conditions, whereas Eukarya comprised the highest percentage of microflora (75%) on the glass simulating the exterior of sensors. Analysis of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis profiles indicated that copper and Delrin shared the same community diversity, which was not the case for glass and PMMA, or between PMMA and copper/Delrin. Sequence alignment matches belonged exclusively to uncultivable microorganisms, most of which were not further classified. One extracted sequence found on glass was associated with Cowellia sp., while another extracted from the PMMA surface was associated with a bacterium in the Alterominidaceae, both -proteobacteria. The results demonstrate the necessity of understanding biofilm formation in the deep sea and the potential need for mitigation strategies for any kind of long-term deployment of remote sensors in the marine environment.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic condition of great public health concern globally. The associated morbidity, mortality and healthcare utilisation place an enormous burden on healthcare infrastructure and services. This study demonstrates a multistage quantile regression approach to predicting excess demand for health care services in the form of asthma daily admissions in London, using retrospective data from the Hospital Episode Statistics, weather and air quality. Trivariate quantile regression models (QRM) of asthma daily admissions were fitted to a 14-day range of lags of environmental factors, accounting for seasonality in a hold-in sample of the data. Representative lags were pooled to form multivariate predictive models, selected through a systematic backward stepwise reduction approach. Models were cross-validated using a hold-out sample of the data, and their respective root mean square error measures, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values compared. Two of the predictive models were able to detect extreme number of daily asthma admissions at sensitivity levels of 76 % and 62 %, as well as specificities of 66 % and 76 %. Their positive predictive values were slightly higher for the hold-out sample (29 % and 28 %) than for the hold-in model development sample (16 % and 18 %). QRMs can be used in multistage to select suitable variables to forecast extreme asthma events. The associations between asthma and environmental factors, including temperature, ozone and carbon monoxide can be exploited in predicting future events using QRMs.

AB  - The elements determining the meteorological conditions are the main parameters in processes of airborne pollen modeling. In modern research the influence of different meteorological element or their complex is analyzed basing upon the statistic methods or using dispersion models in which the possible influence of meteorological parameters upon airborne pollen is described in equations. The correlation of meteorological indicators and pollen concentration in the atmosphere fixed in Klaipeda Aerobiological Station is analyzed in this article. The coefficients of correlation of meteorological parameters and pollen concentration are calculated basing upon the Spearman's rank correlation method. The analysis of various factors was used for determining the complex influence of meteorological parameters upon the pollen concentration in the air. After evaluation of influence of meteorological parameters as separate factors one has determined that more than a half of analyzed pollen types showed statistically reliable (p < 0.05) correlation of pollen amount in the air and relative air humidity (89%), air temperature (74%) and amount of precipitation (52%). The investigation results showed that 37% of pollen amount of indicated plants genera and families in the atmosphere was determined by wind velocity. After evaluation of complex influence of meteorological factors on the concentration of pollen spread in the air one has determined that relative humidity and/or air temperature are one of the most significant environmental factors determining the amount of pollen in the atmosphere during the vegetation. Their influence was determined for all the three cases under study.

AB  - Soil invertebrate communities are fundamental components of wet meadow ecosystems. We compared soil invertebrate biodiversity between restored and native wet meadows to assess the effectiveness of restoration practices. Biodiversity and biomass were measured in 2002 and 2003 from four native and three restored sites located along a 100-km stretch of the Platte River in south-central Nebraska. The sites ranged in age from 3 to 6 years since restoration. Samples were collected during May, July, and September each year. Soil temperature, soil moisture, percent litter cover, and root mass were measured at each site. Twelve 20 x 20 x 25-cm soil blocks were extracted at each site; soil was washed through a 1-mm sieve; and invertebrates were identified, counted, and weighed. Native sites had higher Shannon and Simpson diversity values and contained greater invertebrate biomass than restored sites. Five invertebrate taxa (isopods, scarab beetles, click beetles, earthworms, and ants) were collected with enough frequency to assess restoration effects on their occurrence. Of these, only ants occurred more frequently in restored sites. Restored sites generally had less litter cover, lower root mass, lower soil moisture, and higher soil temperature than native sites. Current restoration practices may not be completely effective at returning sites to native conditions. Physical reconstruction of wet meadow topography and high-diversity reseeding may not be adequate to fully restore soil invertebrate communities, even over extended periods of time.

AB  - Nitrogen fixation is an important process in biogeochemical cycles exclusively carried out by prokaryotes, mostly by an evolutionarily conserved nitrogenase protein complex, of which one of the structural genes (nifH) is highly valuable for phylogenetic and diversity analyses. We developed a nifH-based short oligonucleotide microarray (nifH diagnostic microarray) as a rapid tool to effectively monitor nitrogen-fixing diazotrophic populations in a wide range of environments. Taking account of the overwhelming predominance of environmental nifH fragments from uncultivated microorganisms in public databases, our nifH microarray is mainly based on nifH sequences from as yet unidentified prokaryotes. Standard conditions for microarray performance were determined, and criteria for the design of specific oligonucleotides were defined. A primary set of 56 oligonucleotides was validated with fluorescence-labeled single-stranded nifH targets from five reference strains, 26 environmental clones, and artificial mixtures of reference strains. The nifH microarray was applied to analyze the diversity (based on DNA) and activity (based on mRNA) of diazotrophs in roots of wild rice samples from Namibia. Results demonstrated that only a small subset of diazotrophs being present in the sample were actually fixing nitrogen actively. Our data suggest that the developed nifH microarray is a highly reproducible and semiquantitative method for mapping the variability of diazotrophic diversity, allowing rapid comparisons of the relative abundance and activity of diazotrophic prokaryotes in the environment. A further refined nifH microarray comprising of 194 oligonucleotide probes now covers more than 90% of sequences in our nifH database.

AB  - An electrothermal vaporization (ETV)/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique has been developed to determine the ultratrace metallic impurities of 10 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb) in the natural oxide layer on a Si wafer. SiO2 reacts to form SiF62- with hydrofluoric acid in vapor-phase decomposition. The pyrolysis temperature (150 degrees C) for eliminating SiF62- was added to the ETV operating conditions, because the existence of Si-28, Si-21(2), and (SiO2)-Si-28 due to SiF62- influences the ion intensities of Al-27, Fe-56, and Ni-60, respectively. Furthermore, adding 25 ng of a palladium modifier improved the linearity of each calibration curve. As a result, it was possible to determine the 10 elements in concentration ranges of 20 (40) -10000 pg ml(-1). The recovery percentages obtained by adding the mixed standard solution to the sample solution were 95-105%, showing that the ETV/ICP-MS measurements are accurate. The detection limit (3 sigma) was approximately 10(6) (Pb)-10(8) (Na) atoms cm(-2) for a Si wafer with a diameter of 130 mm. This method can be applied to the above wafer to determine the 10 metallic elements (10(9)-10(11) atoms cm(-2)).

AB  - Changes in the below-ground system of ash dumps reclaimed by covering with turf were estimated using parameters and indices based on analysis of nematode communities. Higher trophic diversity, higher values of Maturity Index (MI), and higher complexity of foodweb structure were expected when reclamation proceeded.
   The study was carried out for three years in chronosequences of ash dumps. Two of the dumps were reclaimed shorter and were studied between the 2(nd) and 5(th) year of reclamation, the first one was reclaimed by covering with turf with mineral soil (S-M), the second one with turf with organogenic soil (S-O). The third ash dump reclaimed in longer time, covered with turf with organogenic soil was studied between the 8(th)-11(th) year of reclamation (L-O). Until the fourth year of reclamation S-O site provided better conditions for the development of nematodes than S-M site; trophic diversity and MI were higher in S-O site in comparison with S-M site. Later on most parameters and indices were similar in S-M and S-O site. Longer reclamation resulted in higher total abundance, higher abundance of bacterivores, plant feeders and omnivores, and also higher biomass of bacterivores and plant feeders. However, changes in the below-ground system of reclaimed ash dumps were very slow because even after 11 years of reclamation the ash dump had the features of a degraded environment.

AB  - In the first part of the paper, data from pilot plant studies are used to evaluate Cryptosporidium removal by dissolved air Rotation (DAF) clarification and dual media filters under challenge conditions. Oocyst removals were investigated for design detention times and hydraulic loadings for winter and spring seasons. Coagulation was optimized for turbidity and removal of natural organic matter. DAF performance was better for spring water temperatures achieving 2.5 +/- 0.3 log removal of oocysts compared to 1.7 +/- 0.3 log removal in the winter. Cumulative log removal across DAF and filtration exceeded 5.4, and was not affected by water temperature. Low turbidities and particle counts are indicators of good treatment and good removals of Cryptosporidium. The second part of the paper uses a mathematical model to predict the fate of Cryptosporidium through a DAF plant and the impact of filter backwash recycle on oocyst build-up in the plant influent. Model predictions show that the fate of Cryptosporidium and the build-up of oocysts in the plant influent depend on: DAF performance, the percent of filtered water production used for backwashing, and the percent of filter backwash recycle Row. A DAF plant with 2.5% filtered water production for backwashing and that achieves 1.6 log removal or greater of oocysts by DAF clarification will not have a build-up of oocysts in the plant influent regardless of the recycle rate. This is because the oocysts are concentrated in the DAF floated sludge and not within granular filters.

AB  - As an integral part of our continued development of water quality assessment approaches, we combined integrative sampling, instrumental analysis of widely occurring anthropogenic contaminants, and the application of a suite of bioindicator tests as a specific part of a broader survey of ecological conditions, species diversity, and habitat quality in the Santa Cruz River in Arizona, USA. Lipid-containing semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were employed to sequester waterborne hydrophobic chemicals. Instrumental analysis and a suite of bioindicator tests were used to determine the presence and potential toxicological relevance of mixtures of bioavailable chemicals in two major water sources of the Santa Cruz River. The SPMDs were deployed at two sites; the effluent weir of the International Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWWTP) and the Nogales Wash. Both of these systems empty into the Santa Cruz River and the IWWTP effluent is a potential source of water for a constructed wetland complex. Analysis of the SPMD sample extracts revealed the presence of organochlorine pesticides (OCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The bioindicator tests demonstrated increased liver enzyme activity, perturbation of neurotransmitter systems and potential endocrine disrupting effects (vitellogenin induction) in fish exposed to the extracts. With increasing global demands on limited water resources, the approach described herein provides an assessment paradigm applicable to determining the quality of water in a broad range of aquatic systems.

AB  - Leaf canopy dynamicsare associated with crop productivity. Frequent, non-destructive measurements of the leaf canopy using a plant canopy analyzer, followed by parameterization using a mathematical model, enabled the quantification of leaf area growth characteristics. However, an understanding of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar effect under various field conditions is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to compare leaf area growth parameters with rice productivity and analyze the cultivar differences in these relationships. In a 3-yr field experiment, six rice cultivars were grown under environments with different nutrient provisions. Two leaf area growth parameters (maximum leaf area index growth rate and maximum interception rate) were determined from the measurements obtained using a plant canopy analyzer. They were compared with five crop growth parameters for rice productivity (yield, total dry weight, crop growth rate, nitrogen uptake rate, and radiation use efficiency). A logarithmic relationship exists between leaf area growth and crop growth parameters, which varied among rice cultivars. In addition, the leaf nitrogen content at the heading stage was associated with the cultivar variations. After considering the cultivar differences, yield prediction accuracy was improved using leaf area growth parameters (from R-2 = .428 to R-2 = .752). This indicates that these parameters are considered efficient indicators of rice productivity with regard to cultivar differences and leaf nitrogen content. The evaluation method using the parameters calculated with non-destructive measurements could be a standard for crop monitoring in field experiments and will be useful for estimating crop productivity.

AB  - Although many improved conceptual designs of natural gas liquids (NGLs) recovery processes have been introduced to enhance the economics and efficiency, real-world applications remain elusive because of the communication gap between researchers and practitioners. To bridge this gap, a state-of-the-art assessment of the NGLs recovery processes is presented along with an overall outline considering the feed conditions, product recovery, purity, specific energy consumption (SEC), process economics, and analysis software using the equation of state model. Lower NGL components in the feed have a higher SEC and lower operating costs than a rich feed. It was also found that the conceptual processes are more energy intensive and complex than commercial processes. The major challenges associated with NGL recovery were assessed, including a high energy consumption, varying feed composition, flexibility in the product recovery, and design considerations for offshore NGL processing. Future directions are proposed, including the application of hybrid separation processes and a process intensification to enhance the compactness, particularly for offshore applications, process optimization, and heat integration. Further, an economic policy study is conducted that provides insight into market dynamics. The development of new natural gas (NG) reserves will boost the NGL market and NG business.

AB  - Evidence has shown that populations within diverse communities are affected by natural hazards and disasters disproportionately. Critically, it is suggested that it is the fault of pre-existing socioeconomic conditions and systemic discrimination which lead to such inequitable disaster outcomes, as geophysical phenomena themselves are unable to discriminate between peoples. Despite this understanding, limited studies have been conducted in developing a systematic procedure for alleviating the inequities of disasters; a review of the concepts of equity and equality in the context of disaster resilience is presented. Given these issues, a novel framework for designing disaster resource distributions has been proposed. The Societally-Informed Optimization of Resource Distributions (SIORD) framework provides guidance on designing resource distributions which lead to equitable disaster outcomes. This framework uses both physical and societal indicators to model the characteristics of a community and to predict the resulting population impacts of a given natural hazard event. Computational optimization, through the use of genetic algorithms, serves as the main analytic tool for designing societally fair resource distributions. In order to place social equity metrics as the primary objective function, a novel measurement of social equity in a disaster setting was developed, and ready to-use social equity metrics are described for use in the framework. Recommendations are provided towards the framework's implementation into practice in the context of the United States.

AB  - The paper presents the research results of the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) seed germination ability in conditions of stress caused by high temperature due to simulation of fire in nature (100 C for 2.5 and 5 minutes). The seed germination of two genotypes of black locust was examined using a standard method, The result was presented using quantitative indicators of germination (technical germination, germination energy).
   The research aim was to examine the tolerance of black locust seed against fires in nature which is a knowledge that can be useful regarding black locust natural regeneration and nursery production.
   Both studied quantitative indicators showed differences regarding seed germination, as well as a significant influence of the applied treatment. The differences in the germination ability were recognized comparing untreated seeds with those treated by high temperature. Generally speaking, the black locust seed viability is sensitive to the heat treatment (100 C for 2.5 and 5 minutes).
   The obtained results indicate that the black locust seed germination ability was present although it was poor. The differences in terms of reaction to the duration of exposure to high temperature were also evident. The black locust seed germination indicators showed a decrease in germination with longer exposure to high temperature. Also, the effect of high temperature increased the percentage of rotten seed, while decreased the percentage of healthy ungerminated seeds,
   These results are important for further researches on tolerance of black locust seed (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) against natural fires,

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the trophic state of three reservoirs located in the northwest of Algeria based on the physicochemistry of water and the community of rotifers. The measurements of the physicochemical variables were carried out monthly over a 2-year period from December 2015 to November 2017. The rotifers were sampled simultaneously. Abiotic and biotic indices such as the Carlson index,Q(B/T), and TSI(ROT)were determined in order to classify the three reservoirs according to their trophic state. Thus, the diversity indices of Shannon-Wiener (H '), Margalef richness index (D), Pielou evenness (J '), and the density were calculated in order to study the structure of the rotifers. The Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed the heterogeneity of the physicochemical quality (Pvalue < 0.05) among the three reservoirs. A total of 71 species were identified during this study. The result of the various indices affirms this heterogeneity and indicates a trophic state hypereutrophic for the Hammam Boughrara reservoir, eutrophic for the Bakhadda reservoir and meso-oligotrophic for Sidi Yacoub. The use of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) has shown that the structure of rotifers is influenced by local environmental factors. Some species such as the genusBrachionusspecies have shown their preference for extreme conditions. The use of biotic indices is highly recommended for the trophic state evaluation of reservoirs for a better water resources management.

AB  - Growing calls and the need for sustainable agriculture have brought deserved attention to soil and to efforts towards improving or maintaining soil health. Numerous research and field experiments report soil health in terms of physicochemical and biological indicators, and identify different management practices that can improve it. However, the question remains how much of cultivated land has degraded since the dawn of agriculture? What is the maximum or realistically attainable soil health goal? Determination of a benchmark that defines the true magnitude of degradation and simultaneously sets potential soil health goals will optimize efforts in improving soil health using different practices. In this paper, we discuss a new term "Soil Health Gap" that is defined as the difference between soil health in an undisturbed native soil and current soil health in a cropland in a given agroecosystem. Soil Health Gap can be determined based on a general or specific soil property such as soil carbon. Soil organic carbon were measured at native grassland, no till, conventionally tilled, and subsoil exposed farmlands. Soil Health Gap based on soil organic carbon was in order of no-till < conventional till < subsoil exposed farmland and subsequently, maximum attainable soil health goal with introduction of conservation practices would vary by an existing management practice or condition. Soil Health Gap establishes a benchmark for soil health management decisions and goals and can be scaled up from site-specific to regional to global scale. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The southern California rock crab fishery targets stocks comprised of three species: red (Cancer productus), yellow (Metacarcinus anthonyi), and brown rock crab (Romaleon antennarium). Fishers have expressed concern about the sustainability of the fishery due to increased fishing effort over the past decade, and because it is managed as one assemblage despite distinct life history differences among the species. We collaborated with fishers to test for stock-specific declines in key fishery-dependent indicators by replicating a 2008 study in 2016-2017 and comparing indicator values between years using multiple regression techniques. Indicators included spatially explicit species-level data for size, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), discard rate, sex composition, and trap location and depth across the heavily fished Santa Barbara Channel and Northern Channel Islands. Results showed significant declines in male size, overall CPUE, and proportion of crab landed versus discarded for heavily targeted stocks, translating to fewer pounds per trap and potential financial losses for fishers. Fishing and environmental conditions may have both contributed to stock declines. Evidence of decline differed substantially across space, species, and sex. We suggest that a spatially explicit and adaptive approach to empirically managing southern California rock crab may help to protect fishers from financial loss and avoid continued depletion of certain stocks, and we show that relatively simple collaborative approaches can provide defensible insight into complex systems.

AB  - New Entrepreneurial ventures whether small or medium, are considered to be the backbone of any country's economy. The creation of new business ventures along with the number of existing high-growth companies is a strong indicator of a nation's present and future economic development. The Entrepreneurship Center at Miami University of Ohio defines entrepreneurship as "Entrepreneurship is the process of identifying, developing and bringing a vision to life. The vision may be an innovative idea, an opportunity or simply a better way to do something. The end result of this process is the creation of a new venture formed under conditions of risk and considerable uncertainty". There is seeming consensus on the importance of entrepreneurship in ameliorating some socio economic problems especially poverty, unemployment and all sorts of social vices in the society. There is a need to catalyze and scale up and enrich the entrepreneurial ecosystem. An ecosystem is nothing but a system of interconnected stakeholders, institutions and individuals; whose close linkages enable efficient production, diffusion and use of new and economically useful knowledge. We need to create more linkages and strengthen the existing ones, creating a tight mesh. The case mentioned below is of a struggling entrepreneur from Kolhapur, Maharashtra. It highlights his bumpy entrepreneurial journey and his never die entrepreneurial spirit. The case also aims to highlight the importance of nurturing an erfrepreneurial mindset in our society which will result in lending a helping hand to startups in their initial leap into the entrepreneurial journey.

AB  - BackgroundCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most severe lower respiratory tract infections with a high in-hospital mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the socioeconomic and medical risk factors affecting the prognosis of acute pneumonia. The results of this study can mention the value of socioeconomic backgrounds like poverty and illiteracy in clinical practice, even in a well-known biological phenomenon (eg acute pneumonia).
   MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, all admitted patients to a tertiary teaching hospital with a diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia in a 12-month period were enrolled. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, underlying conditions, clinical manifestations and para-clinical test results at admission registered prospectively. A logistic regression model was conducted using in-hospital mortality as the dependent variable.
   ResultsA total of 621 patients was included in this study. Among them, 47 patients (7.6%) died during the hospitalisation period. In multiple logistic regression analysis, pleural effusion, a higher CURB-65 score, hyponatremia, hyperglycaemia and poverty (being in the lower economic class) were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality in community-acquired pneumonia.
   ConclusionNumerous factors can influence the prognosis of CAP. In addition to the CURB-65 score and some other medical risk factors, socioeconomic backgrounds can also affect the early outcome in CAP. In this study, being in the lower economic class (as an indicator of poverty) is interpreted as an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis in CAP.

AB  - The microphytoplankton record of Parnaiba Basin is typically of Devonian age and commonly associated with changes in marine environments. The method of Indicator Species Analysis (IndVal) was applied as a tool for reconstructing marine environment changes during the Devonian (Pragian-Famennian). The IndVal expresses which taxa are strongly associated with particular groups of samples. The Devonian microphytoplankton distribution reflects the paleoenvironment, and the IndVal indices illustrated how the taxa interacted through time and reveals patterns in the changing composition of the microphytoplankton. The material studied derives from three well sections, ARN (12 samples), NA (22 samples) and LT (13 samples), drilled through the Itaim, Pimenteira and Cabecas formations in the Parnaiba Basin, respectively. Samples were prepared using the standard palynological method. The indicator species coincidently are age-diagnostic. For the Devonian succession, the IndVal indicates fourteen taxa, viz. Schizocystia saharica, Triangulina alargada, Bimerga paulae (Pragian-Emsian Interval), Onondagella asymetrica, Tunisphaeridium tentaculiferum, Estiastra spp. (Early Givetian Interval), Mediocorpore conspicuus, unattributed species of Unellium (Frasnian 1 Interval), Petrovina connata, unattributed species of Acriora, (Frasnian 2 Interval), Winwaloeusia distracta, unattributed species of Stellinium (Frasnian 3 Interval), Arkonites bilixus and unattributed species of Duvernaysphaera. (Frasnian-Famennian Interval). Microphytoplankton typical of more nearshore settings are recorded in the basal interval (Pragian-Emsian Interval) accompanied by high values of phytoclasts and continental:marine ratio (C/M). A change in microphytoplankton is recorded, with an increase in acritarchs and prasinophycean algae typical of open marine conditions, in particular during the Frasnian 3 Interval. The change reflects sea level rise.

AB  - The paper explores the links between capital relocation and soft locational factors addressing the quality of the business environment and the quality of life within the European Union. System competition is viewed as a competition between countries for the mobile factors capital and labour. The issue of systems competition is topical and insufficiently explored by contemporary literature. The scarcity of scientific papers describing the links between system competition theories and contemporary corporate geography theories, especially of the ones including the analysis of soft location factors, is a challenging aspect, which motivates the choice of this subject. This paper's primary aim is to deliver an overview of the basic corporate geography conceptions, stressing the importance of soft location factors in today's competition between systems for the mobile factors capital and labour. The paper further contains an analysis of the correlations between indicators regarding the institutional design of countries as developed by the World Bank (Ease of Doing Business), the Happiness Scale and the latest available data of FDI Stocks for the EU countries (2016). The relevance of such a study is based on the evidence that the contemporary business education relies on an extensive knowledge of the business environment. In the circumstance of similar infrastructural conditions, the main difference between locations is made by soft location factors. Since developed economies are characterised by a high degree of ubiquity of soft factors, the paper concludes that developing and emerging economies should foster the development of their soft location factors.

AB  - Swiss Bogs of National Importance were designated as protected areas in 1991. However, their quality was found to have decreased over a 5-7 year monitoring period. In this article we assess the quality of the vegetation and its changes in 80 bogs throughout Switzerland. To determine change over time, 2912 pairs of records from revisited plots were compared. The indicator for quality was the ratio of specialists to the full species list in each record. We performed linear regressions to assess the proportion of variance explained by the variables: bog area, distance to edge, bog density, altitude and draining structures within the bog core areas and their surroundings. To specify the site conditions, we analysed Landolt's mean indicator values for light, humidity and nutrients. Finally, we derived a raw estimate of the loss in bog area. Distance to edge, bog density and draining structures outside the bogs had the best explanatory power for the quality of bog vegetation. The quality increased with distance from the edge. It correlated better with nutrients indicator values than with humidity values. With regard to quality changes, humidity indicator values decreased mainly in the bog centres, whereas increasing nutrients values and decreasing light values mainly affected the margins. We estimated that the loss of high quality surface affected about 0.6 % of the total Swiss bog area.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze how factors in the external environment affect social enterprise (SE) development in Canada. With the decline in government funding for non-profit organizations, SE development is gaining greater traction. SEs are businesses and can be analyzed with methods similar to those for traditional businesses. Just as the external environment is important for assessing the success of businesses, in this study, the authors examine the external environment related to SEs.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this statistical analysis, the authors compared 62 factors across 33 census metropolitan areas (CMAs) in Canada while treating SE revenue as the dependent variable. Links between the dependent variable and the external environment were analyzed through correlation and regression tests. Publicly available revenue figures for non-profit SEs by CMAs were compared with a selection of external environment factors, including demographic information and health indicators, also organized by CMA, as published by Statistics Canada.
   Findings - The analysis demonstrated that three of the factors displayed significant positive correlation and one resulted in a predictive value. Positive correlations were discovered between SE revenue per capita and three of the variables: university education, perceived health, very good or excellent and no religious affiliation. Only university education was found to have predictive value.
   Originality/value - This study is the first to compare SE revenue and the external environment across Canada's CMAs. The results show that factors in the external environment create conditions more conducive to SE development.

AB  - Forest above-ground biomass ( AGB) is an important indicator for understanding the global carbon cycle. It is hard to obtain a geographically and statistically representative AGB dataset, which is limited by unpredictable environmental conditions and high economical cost. A spatially explicit AGB reference map was produced by airborne LiDAR data and calibrated by field measurements. Three different sampling strategies were designed to sample the reference AGB, PALSAR backscatter, and texture variables. Two parametric and four nonparametric models were established and validated based on the sampled dataset. Results showed that random stratified sampling that used LiDAR-evaluated forest age as stratification knowledge performed the best in the AGB sampling. The addition of backscatter texture variables improved the parametric model performance by an R-2 increase of 21% and a root-mean-square error ( RMSE) decrease of 10 Mgha(-1). One of the four nonparametric models, namely, the random forest regression model, obtained comparable performance ( R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 14.95 Mgha(-1)) to the parametric model. Higher estimation errors occurred in the forest stands with lower canopy cover or higher AGB levels.

AB  - Because estuaries are dynamic on many temporal scales, it is difficult to differentiate long-term shifts from those resulting from erratic pulse events like severe storms. Diatoms are abundant and diverse in estuaries, and may characterize these dynamics across relevant time scales. The climate of south Florida is subtropical, with dry winters and wet summers that may also harbor tropical storms and cyclones. We investigated whether these repeated seasonal drivers of change in estuaries differ from the influence of tropical cyclones on planktonic and benthic diatom assemblages. Diatom assemblages and environmental parameters were measured in the Charlotte Harbor watershed of southwest Florida to identify differences between the wet and dry seasons and changes that occurred following Tropical Storm Debby in 2012. Indicator taxa that were significantly affiliated with each season and post-storm conditions were identified. Diatom assemblages across the watershed were similar in wet and dry seasons, but differences increased following the tropical storm. The reduction in community dispersion following the storm was pronounced in each of the major drainages of the estuary. There were spatially-distinct responses of diatoms to environmental changes driven by the storm. These results suggest that past storm activity could be detected using diatoms preserved in estuarine sediments using both single indicator-species as well as community approaches.

AB  - Over the decade 2004-2013 environmental changes in the Pacific sector of the Arctic have been dramatic enough to suggest that a 'new normal' climate is emerging. The clearest indicator of this change is the dramatic loss of sea ice during the summer, which in some years has already resulted in essentially ice-free conditions in this region. For example, between 7 August and 11 October 2012, sea ice concentration in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas between 70 and 80 degrees N fell below 20% (with a record minimum concentration of only 5% on 2 September). Thick multiyear sea ice (older than 2 years) has almost entirely disappeared, replaced by thin and more mobile first-year ice. Year-to-year variability in ice concentration is associated with anomalous wind forcing linked to larger-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, which also affect ocean currents, including transport through Bering Strait. With reduced sea ice extent the area of ice-free ocean susceptible to rapid solar heating has increased. More heat is stored in the upper ocean early in the summer melt season and persists later into the autumn freeze-up. Monthly surface air temperature anomalies greater than 6 degrees C have occurred frequently in the autumn in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. Environmental variations in the Bering Sea over the last decade have been subtle by comparison, and include an increase in winter sea-ice extent between 2007 and 2013. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mounting evidence supports the role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in physiological signaling as well as pathological conditions. However, the subtleties of peroxide-mediated signaling are not well understood, in part because the generation, degradation, and diffusion of H2O2 are highly volatile within different cellular compartments. Therefore, the direct measurement of H2O2 in living specimens is critically important. Fluorescent probes that can detect small changes in H2O2 levels within relevant cellular compartments are important tools to study the spatial dynamics of H2O2. To achieve temporal resolution, the probes must also be photostable enough to allow multiple readings over time without loss of signal. Traditional fluorescent redox sensitive probes that have been commonly used for the detection of H2O2 tend to react with a wide variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and often suffer from photostablilty issues. Recently, new classes of H2O2 probes have been designed to detect H2O2 with high selectivity. Advances in H2O2 measurement have enabled biomedical scientists to study H2O2 biology at a level of precision previously unachievable. In addition, new imaging techniques such as two-photon microscopy (TPM) have been employed for H2O2 detection, which permit real- time measurements of H2O2 in vivo. This review focuses on recent advances in H2O2 probe development and optical imaging technologies that have been developed for biomedical applications.

AB  - Marine deposits representing the last two transgressive Quaternary events (late Pleistocene and Holocene) are observed along the coastal area of the southwestern Atlantic. Littoral deposits in the Anegada Bay region, southern province of Buenos Aires, are characterized by good preservation and abundance of fossil marine shells, especially gastropods and bivalves. These records, which have not been previously investigated from a paleontological viewpoint, are here useful as indicators of Quaternary environmental changes. The aim of this study was to describe and to compare the molluscan fauna of late Pleistocene with the equivalent of the Holocene. For that, we analyzed two areas within this region: Canal Villalonga and Los Pocitos. Compared to the Holocene, Pleistocene marine deposits (associated to Marine Isotope Stage MIS5e)from Anegada Bay showed a greater number of species, in both gastropods (17 versus 9) and bivalves (14 versus 12). In the Pleistocene deposits of Canal Villalonga is remarkable the presence of Crassostrea rhizophorae (Guilding) and Abra aequalis (Say), which are today displaced toward low latitudes. In relation to micromolluscs, Turbonilla argentina Doello-Jurado is for the first time mentioned for the Pleistocene. Our data indicate that the number of species of bivalves and gastropods was higher during the late Pleistocene than in the Holocene, and that the abundance of species during the Pleistocene has also remained during the Holocene. These variations are interpreted in association with changes in temperature, indicating warmer conditions for the late Pleistocene (last interglacial).

AB  - A detailed investigation of two deep-sea sediment cores from the Gardar Drift in the subpolar North Atlantic, cores MD99-2251 and MD99-2252, has been undertaken to determine the extent of Holocene climate variability reflected by changes in diatom floral abundances. Core MD99-2251 extends through the Holocene, while core MD99-2252 spans the last 7200 years. A new regional-based sea surface temperature (SST) calibration is derived using the weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) method based on 28 taxonomic categories within 53 coretops. WA-PLS-derived SST estimates indicate relatively small long-term SST changes of only 1-2AC during the Holocene. Notably, a well-defined thermal maximum is absent in the early Holocene record and the 8200-year event is not recognized as a discrete temperature minimum. However, lower SSTs between 8800 and 7800 years ago associated with the presence of sea ice and cold water species indicate an increased incursion of the subarctic water mass. A significant warming of similar to 2 degrees C around 7000 years ago is the most unambiguous change in the SST records and is replicated in both cores. A brief interval of warmer sea surface conditions similar to 6000 years ago, associated with a Holocene maximum in North Atlantic Current indicator species, ended by 5300 years ago. Relatively muted SST variability is evident through the remainder of the Holocene.

AB  - Periphyton communities, which are native to river beds, serve as a functional indicator of river health but remain one of the least-studied communities despite the significant increase in the examination of aquatic microbial communities in recent years. In this study, we tested the relevance of three formulations of the chronic detachment term in a simple model for the biomass dynamics of periphyton. Numerical simulations of the periphyton biomass dynamics were performed by using three different descriptors for the flow conditions: the discharge Q, the friction velocity u(*), and the roughness Reynolds number k(+) = u(*)k(s)/nu (where nu is water kinetic viscosity and k(s) is the Nikuradse equivalent sand roughness). Comparisons of numerical simulation results with experimental data from literature revealed chronic detachment to be better simulated by taking the roughness Reynolds number as the external variable of detachment. These results support the idea that transport phenomena that occur in the near-bed layer, e.g. chronic detachment of periphyton matter or vertical transport of nutrients and pollutants in submerged aquatic canopies, are not related to a single turbulence descriptor such as the friction velocity u(*). Its description requires at least two descriptors, here the friction velocity u(*) and the Nikuradse equivalent sand roughness k(s), which depend on the initial form and dimensions of the colonized substratum, and its changes owing to the thickness, resistance, and composition of the epilithic matter.

AB  - Very little is known about seaweed stable carbon isotope discrimination during respiration (Delta(r), defined here as the difference between respired CO2 delta C-13 and algal tissue delta C-13). However, Delta(r) can give information on carbon metabolic pathways in seaweeds, and can also be helpful to better understand their role in carbon cycling. Here we measured the Delta(r) of Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta), Pterocladia capillacea Bornet (Rhodophyta) and Sargassum sp. (Ochrophyta) under 3 different experimental conditions: at 15 and 25 degrees C after strong illumination for 30 to 60 min, and at 25 degrees C after at least 20 h in the dark. We observed a correlation between Delta(r) and the respiratory quotient (RQ, defined as the ratio between CO2 release and O-2 consumption), suggesting changes in the organic substrate used for respiration in the different treatments. Delta(r) was positive in most cases, suggesting that carbohydrates were the likely substrate for respiration; however, Delta(r) (and the RQ) decreased with an increase in temperature, suggesting increased use of lipids as substrates. Although Delta(r) was not large (averaging 3 parts per thousand), the influence of seaweed respiration on the delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon may need to be taken into account in ecosystems where seaweeds dominate primary production (i.e. eutrophic lagoons). Delta(r) may also be important when interpreting seaweed delta C-13 values to determine the form of inorganic carbon used in photosynthesis.

AB  - It has recently been considered urgent to establish an accurate definition and scope of functional foods in the livestock industry in Korea. The tertiary function of food is gradually emphasized with various changes in conditions such as international competitive power enhancement of the whole world, including Korea. Therefore, the purpose of this study was carried out to gather basic information toward the establishment of standardization, management plans, and a system adapted to the Korean state through researching management systems of functional meat and meat products in the European Union (EU) and the Oceania Area (OA). A brief summary of this study is as follows. In the EU and OA, special management systems and laws about functional livestock and products were once nonexistent; only 'nutrition claims' and 'health claims' operated in the nutritional consolidation side of foods. Also, it was once thought that functional index materials and permissions established in the application of functional products sufficed, because management standards for enriched food were not established. Therefore, standardization of functional live stock products needs to be considered based on the case of developed countries in the EU and OA. It also seems that the above functional indicative substances can be applied, based on normal standards of indicative substances of functional products and the normal standards of indicators of functional substances added to livestock products presented ill this study.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Centaurea ragusina L. is an endemic Croatian plant species adapted to life in arid and salt-affected environments. Esterase activity (EST) and isoesterase patterns of C. ragusina plants cultured in vitro under saline and osmotic conditions were determined with an aim to evaluate the potential value of esterase activity as a biomarker of salt/osmotic stress as well as physiological significance of EST variations.
   Material and Methods: Rooted plantlets grown on MS 1/2 nutrient Media supplemented with 150, 300, 450 or 600 mM NaCl or 300 mM mannitol were investigated after 5, 10 and 15 days. Esterase activity was determined using either 1- or 2-naphthylacetate as substrates.
   Results and Conclusion: Esterase activities in shoots increased under low saline and mannitol treatments and decreased in response to increased saline treatments. The highest salt and concentration and mannitol stimulated EST activity in roots. In total, twelve and fourteen esterase isoenzymes were resolved in C. ragusina leaves and roots, respectively. Both salt and mannitol induced new esterase isoenzyme (EST11) while mannitol specifically induced two more (EST4-5); otherwise some bands were weakly expressed or even disappeared as a result of salinity in C. ragusina leaves. Two new isosterases (EST10-11) were resolved in mannitol- and salt-treated roots and four (EST2, EST12-14) only in salt-treated roots. Presented results demonstrate that esterase activities and their isoenzymic patterns could serve as useful bioindicators of salinity.

AB  - Escherichia coli(EC) concentrations at two beaches impacted by river plume dynamics in southern Lake Michigan were analyzed using three-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport models. The relative importance of various physical and biological processes influencing the fate and transport of EC were examined via budget analysis and a first-order sensitivity analysis of model parameters. The along-shore advective flux of EC(CFU/m(2).s) was found to be higher compared to its cross-shore counterpart; however, the sum of diffusive and advective components was of a comparable magnitude in both directions showing the importance of cross-shore exchange in EC transport. Examination of individual terms in the EC mass balance equation showed that vertical turbulent mixing in the water column dominated the overall EC transport for the summer conditions simulated. Dilution due to advection and diffusion accounted for a large portion of the total EC budget in the nearshore, and the net EC loss rate within the water column (CFU/m(3).s) was an order of magnitude smaller compared to the horizontal and vertical transport rates. This result has important implications for modeling EC at recreational beaches; however, the assessment of the magnitude of EC loss rate is complicated due to the strong coupling between vertical exchange and depth-dependent EC loss processes such as sunlight inactivation and settling. Sensitivity analysis indicated that solar inactivation has the greatest impact on EC loss rates. Although these results are site-specific, they clearly bring out the relative importance of various processes involved.

AB  - The barrier protection of an organic coating for a metallic substrate is compromised by the transport of water, oxygen and ions from the environment to the metal/coating interface. Metallic outdoor structures are exposed to the weather and undergo cyclic wetting and drying conditions. In the absence of holidays, the transport of water is diffusion limited. The diffusion coefficients associated with water ingress D-in and egress D-out are indicators of the wetting and drying rates, respectively, of the coating. Gravimetric and capacitance methods are used for the measurement of D-in whereas D-out measurement has been limited to the gravimetric method. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the application of a recently reported method that employed a hydrophilic room temperature ionic liquid to monitor the capacitance changes associated with the egress of water from which D-out was calculated. Experimental results associated with cyclic dilute NaCl wetting and ionic liquid drying are presented for an epoxy coating on an AA 2024-T3 substrate that was subjected to 50 cycles. The D-in and D-out values were calculated using a short-time approximate solution and a series solution to Fick's second law. Presented electrochemical impedance spectra associated with the ends of wet and dry stages of the cycles were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model that separated the bulk coating and metal/coating characteristics.

AB  - Bones of the prosauropod dinosaur Plateosaurus engelhardti from the Norian localities of Trossingen (Germany) and Frick (Switzerland) were sampled for palaeohistological study. Both localities yielded rich material of adult individuals with body sizes of 4(.)80-10 m. Altogether 50 bones from c. 27 individuals were sampled using different methods (coring, cross-sectioning, analysis of existing fracture surfaces). The cortex of most bones consists of the laminar fibro-lamellar complex typical for dinosaurs, indicating fast growth rates. The laminar fibro-lamellar complex in Plateosaurus engelhardti is always cyclically interrupted by lines of arrested growth (LAGs). In some bones, the laminar fibro-lamellar complex changed in the exterior cortex to lamellar-zonal bone, grading peripherally into avascular lamellar bone. Thus, growth was clearly determinate in P. engelhardti, but in contrast to all other dinosaur species for which this is known, the final size of fully grown individuals covers a very broad size range (6-5-10 m). Additionally, growth in P. engelhardti may have been influenced by environmental conditions, as suggested by irregular growth cycle thickness and differences in growth rates. Both reflect a more reptilian growth pattern than is known from any other dinosaur, agreeing with the basal phylogenetic position of P. engelhardti. Nevertheless, in Plateosaurus the foundations for very fast growth and the evolution of gigantism in sauropods are already in place.

AB  - Abandoned mine tailings sites in semiarid regions remain unvegetated for extended periods of time and are subject to eolian dispersion and water erosion. This study examines the potential phytostabitization of a lead-zinc mine tailings site using a native, drought-tolerant halophyte, quailbush [Atriplex lentiformis (Torr.) S. Wats.]. In a greenhouse study germination, growth, and metal uptake was evaluated in two compost-amended mine tailings samples, K4 (pH 3) and K6 (pH 6) at 75, 85, 90, 95, and 100% mine tailings, and two controls, off-site and compost. Microbial community changes were monitored by performing MPN analysis of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria as well as heterotrophic plate counts. Results demonstrate that germination is not a good indicator for phytostabilization since it was only inhibited in the unamended K4 treatment. Plant growth was significantly reduced in 95 and 100% mine tailings, while growth in 75, 85, and 90% treatments was similar to the off-site control. Quailbush accumulated elevated levels of the nutrient metals Na, K, Mn, and Zn in the shoot tissues; however, metal accumulation was generally below the domestic animal toxicity limit Initially, autotrophic population estimates were four to six logs higher than heterotrophic counts, indicating extremely stressed conditions. However, post-harvest, heterotrophic bacterial counts increased to normal levels (similar to 10(6) CFU g(-1) dry tailings) and dominated the rhizosphere. Therefore, with compost amendment, quailbush has good potential as a native species candidate for phytostabilization of mine tailings in semiarid environments.

AB  - A scaling analysis has been used to capture the integrated behaviour of several photochemical mechanisms for a wide range of precursor concentrations and a variety of environmental conditions. The Buckingham Pi method of dimensional analysis was used to express the relevant variables in terms of dimensionless groups. These grouping show maximum ozone, initial NOx and initial VOC concentrations are made non-dimensional by the average NO2 photolysis rate (j(av)) and the rate constant for the NO - O-3 titration reaction (k(NO)); temperature by the NO - O-3 activation energy (E-NO) and Boltzmann constant (k) and total irradiation time by the cumulative j(av) Delta t photolysis rate. The analysis shows dimensionless maximum ozone concentration can be described by a product of powers of dimensionless initial NOx concentration, dimensionless temperature, and a similarity curve directly dependent on the ratio of initial VOC to NOx concentration and implicitly dependent on the cumulative NO2 photolysis rate. When Weibull transformed, the similarity relationship shows a scaling break with dimensionless model output clustering onto two straight line segments, parameterized using four variables: two describing the slopes of the line segments and two giving the location of their intersection. A fifth parameter is used to normalize the model output. The scaling analysis, similarity curve and parameterization appear to be independent of the details of the chemical mechanism, hold for a variety of VOC species and mixtures and a wide range of temperatures and actinic fluxes.

AB  - Accumulated temperature may provide an indicator of the phenology of cool-season grass to assist in the timing of management operations but its value is highly dependent on a reliable measure of phyllochron, i.e. time between the elongation of successive leaves. Field and controlled environment studies with Italian ryegrass (IRG, Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and tall fescue (TF, Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) measured leaf-appearance responses to accumulated temperature with varying conditions of exposure to low temperatures, soil moisture content and nitrogen application. In a controlled environment, soil volumetric water contents below 20% (equivalent to moisture potentials greater than -0.1 MPa) or more frequent exposure to below-freezing air temperatures increased the phyllochron values on the main tiller of IRG and TF. There was no evidence of an interaction between soil moisture content and cold exposure on phyllochron values. Nitrogen application resulted in only small reduction in phyllochron values. In field studies over 4 years the phyllochron values in IRG during the months of January to March were 184, 180, 180 and 167 accumulated degrees C above 0 degrees C leaf(-1), more than double the mean value measured in a controlled environment. A greater understanding of the impact of variable low temperatures and of soil moisture potential on the phyllochron is necessary before accumulated temperature can be used to indicate changes in development stages in grasses in different environments.

AB  - Information technologies (IT) provide new approaches for better access to environmental information and for improving the implementation of environmental goals in landscape planning. Many potentially suitable tools already exist. However, most have been developed in a different planning context, such as town planning or environmental impact assessment, and are only partly suitable for the comprehensive task of landscape planning. A number of important questions concerning the application of these tools in landscape planning remain unanswered: which types of tools are needed to solve the problems in landscape planning?; must these tools be adapted to the special conditions of landscape planning?; how should they be co-ordinated and ultimately integrated into a landscape planning support system? An analysis of the implementation problems in German landscape planning and the potentials of IT suggests new approaches and answers to these questions. This paper explores the effective use of IT in landscape planning and describes a model landscape planning support system that was developed and tested during the research project `Interactive Landscape Plan' in Koenigslutter am Elm, Germany. The pilot project incorporated important components of an IT-supported landscape planning system: a geographical information system (GIS), tools for the support of communication in public participation, visualization tools and Decision Support Systems (DSSs). The project offers ` open-source' solutions, including a newly developed on-line participation tool, and an evaluation of selected visualization tools.

AB  - Background: Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), a genetic deletion condition with numerous cognitive sequelae, is associated with a high rate of psychiatric disorders in childhood. More recently, VCFS has been identified as a high-risk factor for developing adult onset schizophrenia. However, it has never been demonstrated that the childhood psychiatric disorders found in children with VCFS differ from those found in children with a similar degree of cognitive impairment. Identification of a specific behavioral (psychiatric) phenotype in childhood VCFS offers the potential for elucidating the symptomatic precursors of adult onset schizophrenia.
   Methods: Twenty-eight children with VCFS and 29 age and cognitively matched control subjects received a standardized assesment of childhood psychiatric disorders and behaviors measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Findings from the two groups were compared.
   Results: The rates and types of psychiatric disorder and behavior problems in VCFS and cognitively matched control subjects were very high, but showed no significant differences.
   Conclusions: Psychopathology in children with VCFS may not differ from that found in cognitively matched control subjects. Another explanation is that subtle phenotypic differences in behavior found in VCFS can not be observed using standard symptom inventories. The high rate of psychopathology in children with VCFS is not a useful phenotypic indicator of high risk for adult onset schizophrenia. (C) 2002 Society, of Biological Psychiatry.

AB  - Molecular techniques employing 16S rDNA profiles generated by PCR-DGGE were used to detect changes in bacterial community structures of the rhizosphere of avocado trees during infection by Phytophthora cinnamomi and during repeated bioaugmentation with a disease suppressive fluorescent pseudomonad. When the 16S rDNA profiles were analyzed by multivariate analysis procedures, distinct microbial communities were shown to occur on healthy and infected roots. Bacterial communities from healthy roots were represented by simple DNA banding profiles, suggestive of colonization by a few predominant species, and were approximately 80% similar in structure. In contrast, roots that were infected with Phytophthora, but which did not yet show visible symptoms of disease, were colonized by much more variable bacterial communities that had significantly different community structures from those of healthy roots. Root samples from trees receiving repeated applications of the disease suppressive bacterium Pseudomonas fluorscens St. 513 were free of Phytophthora infection, and had bacterial community structures that were similar to those of nontreated healthy roots. Sequence analysis of clones generated from four predominant bands cut from the DGGE gels revealed the presence of pseudomonads, as well as several previously unidentified bacteria. Differentiation of 16S rDNA profiles for healthy and infected roots suggests that rhizosphere bacterial community structure may serve as an integrative indicator of changes in chemical and biological conditions in the plant rhizosphere during the infection process.

AB  - High-pressure minerals provide records of processes not normally preserved in Earth's crust. Reidite, a quenchable polymorph of zircon, forms at pressures >20 GPa during shock compression. However, there is no broad consensus among empirical, experimental, and theoretical studies on the nature of the polymorphic transformation. Here we decipher a multistage history of reidite growth recorded in a zircon grain in distal impact ejecta (off-shore northeastern United States) from the ca. 35 Ma Chesapeake Bay impact event which, remarkably, experienced near-complete conversion (89%) to reidite. The grain displays two distinctive reidite habits: (1) intersecting sets of planar lamellae that are dark in cathodoluminescence (CL); and (2) dendritic epitaxial overgrowths on the lamellae that are luminescent in CL. While the former is similar to that described in literature, the latter has not been previously reported. A two-stage growth model is proposed for reidite formation at >40 GPa in Chesapeake Bay impact ejecta: formation of lamellar reidite by shearing during shock compression, followed by dendrite growth, also at high pressure, via recrystallization. The dendritic reidite is interpreted to nucleate on lamellae and replace damaged zircon adjacent to lamellae, which may be amorphous ZrSiO4 or possibly an intermediate phase, all before quenching. These results provide new insights on the microstructural evolution of the highpressure polymorphic transformation over the microseconds-long interval of reidite stability during meteorite impact. Given the formation conditions, dendritic reidite may be a unique indicator of distal ejecta.

AB  - Biochar as a biomass derived, low cost, carbon conductive material is considered as an important supplement in the anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic matter. It functions as an electrical grid to allow direct electron transfer from fatty acid oxidizers to methanogenic archaea, thereby promoting syntophy between various microbial groups and leading to efficient methanogenesis. Specific properties of biochar play an important role in promoting syntrophic interactions in AD. As a physical indicator, surface area, porosity, particle size and surface texture of biochar play an important role in governing microbial attachment and enrichment on biochar. This influences the microbial degradation of fatty acids and their subsequent conversion to methane by methanogens. Chemical properties such as the presence of hydrophobic functional groups, molecular nature and redox active groups on biochar surface promote interaction between biochar and microorganisms and provide an increased degree of electron transfer between the attached microorganisms. The above characteristics depend on feedstock and pyrolysis conditions used for biochar production. Unlike previous reviews, herein the desired physical and chemical properties of biochar that promote syntrophy in AD and the factors that influence them have been discussed in detail. Furthermore, engineering of biochar properties by various activation methods to harness favourable characteristics of biochar as an effective AD additive is described. Such a comprehensive account would be useful for engineering efficient biochar-mediated digestions with enhanced syntrophy and overall AD performance.

AB  - 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) is an inhibitor of ethylene perception that is widely used to maintain the quality of several climacteric fruits during storage. A large body of literature now exists on the effects of 1-MCP on climacteric fruit ripening for different species and environmental conditions, presenting an opportunity to use meta-analysis to systematically dissect these effects. We classified 44 ripening indicators of climacteric fruits into five categories: physiology and biochemistry, quality, enzyme activity, color, and volatiles. Meta-analysis showed that 1-MCP treatment reduced 20 of the 44 indicators by a minimum of 22% and increased 6 indicators by at least 20%. These effects were associated with positive effects on delaying ripening and maintaining quality. Of the seven moderating variables, species, 1-MCP concentration, storage temperature and time had substantial impacts on the responses of fruit to 1-MCP treatment. Fruits from different species varied in their responses to 1-MCP, with the most pronounced responses observed in rosaceous fruits, especially apple, European pear fruits, and tropical fruits. The effect of gaseous 1-MCP was optimal at 1 mu l/l, with a treatment time of 12-24 h, when the storage temperature was 0 degrees C for temperate fruits or 20 degrees C for tropical fruits, and when the shelf temperature was 20 degrees C, reflecting the majority of experimental approaches. These findings will help improve the efficacy of 1-MCP application during the storage of climacteric fruits, reduce fruit quality losses and increase commercial value.

AB  - Oak ecosystems support a high amount of biodiversity and are critical for avian conservation in the Pacific Northwest, yet most of the remaining habitat is in a degraded state. A landscape-scale restoration project in the Klamath Siskiyou Bioregion of southern Oregon and northern California reduced factors that stress oak trees while improving the function of oak-associated plant communities on 450 ha of private lands from 2011 to 2013. We implemented a before-after-control-impact study to measure changes in vegetation structure and composition, avian community composition, and individual avian species density within 23 restored and 23 control stands. Restoration resulted in reduced Douglas fir and western juniper tree cover and overall shrub cover, but generally did not cause notable shifts between vegetation types (e.g. oak-conifer forest did not become oak woodland). Oak-associated birds were positive indicator species following treatment at the restored sites; yet, the avian community composition shift toward an oak-associated community observed in the NMS ordination was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we observed only negligible change in individual species density of both conifer- and oak-associated birds following restoration. While restoration objectives at all sites sought to improve oak tree vigor and associated ecosystem health, the pre-restoration stand conditions and thus the specific prescriptions varied widely. More study is needed to disentangle how overstory and understory restoration actions interact to affect bird community response.

AB  - Adoption of rice varieties that perform well under high iron-associated (HIA) stress environments can enhance rice production in West Africa. This study reports the genetic characterization of 323 rice accessions and breeding lines cultivated in West Africa using genotyping-by-sequencing and their phenotypic response to HIA treatments in hydroponic solution (1500 mg l(-1) FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O) and hot-spot fields. The germplasm consisted of four genetic subpopulations: Oryza glaberrima (14%), O. sativa japonica (7%), O. sativa-indica Group 1 (45%), and O. sativa-indica Group 2 (25%). Severe versus mild stress in the field was associated with a reduced SPAD value (12%), biomass (56%), and grain yield (57%), with leaf bronzing explaining 30% and 21% of the variation for biomass and grain yield, respectively. Association mapping using 175 indica genotypes identified 23 significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that mapped to 14 genomic regions. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals associated with leaf bronzing, a routinely used indicator of HIA stress, differed in hydroponic compared with field conditions. Contrastingly, six significant SNPs on chromosomes 8 and 9 were associated with the SPAD value under HIA stress in both field and hydroponic experiments, and a candidate potassium transporter gene mapped under the peak on chromosome 8. This study helps define criteria for assessing rice performance under HIA environments.

AB  - The systematically varying properties and generally coherent and predictable behavior of rare earth elements (REE) make them potential tracers for studying water/rock interaction and weathering processes. In this work, a compilation and analysis of REE data in mineral and thermal waters were performed, focusing on their content and distributions in different hydrogeological systems, to quantify the natural REE variability and to discuss the controlling factors of REE concentrations. Quantitative challenges presented by multiply censored data were addressed with nonparametric and multivariate statistical methods. Considering a regional character of the research the application of Q and R mode Hierarchical Cluster Analysis with spatial analysis was an important approach for meaningful interpretation of large data set. An efficient approach to analyze differences between obtained HCA groups (clusters) was using a plot of reference-normalized concentrations. The results showed that REE data along with anomalies of Ce and Eu and inter-element ratios were good indicators of the aquifer lithology (hydrogeological systems formed in granitoid and volcanic rocks of various age, two main types of hydrogeological basins, and carbonate aquifers). The important mechanisms controlling REE migration in water were hydrochemical conditions in aquifers. The significance of the applied statistical analyses was represented by defining specific hydrochemical fingerprints of identified hydrogeological systems with distinct geochemical characteristics where REE showed the necessity of understanding of complex geological and hydrogeological settings, geodynamic evolution, and hydrogeochemical processes in fluid flow systems.

AB  - The data set covers the results of a study of 96 samples of peat bog soil from the fall place of the first stage of the Cyclone-3 launch vehicle contained unburned toxic rocket fuel 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) in the European North of Russia. Soil samples were taken during a helicopter expedition to the "Koida" fall region of Plesetsk Cosmodrome operation zone in October 2015 at different distances from the center of the fall site and from different soil horizons. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography with amperometric detection and gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry. The contents of UDMH and the ten most important products of its transformations (methylhydrazine, hydrazine, 1,1,4,4-tetramethyltetrazene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and furaldehyde N,N-dimethylhydrazones, 1-formyl-2,2-dimethylhydrazine, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-nitrosodimethylamine, and 1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole) were determined. The obtained data reflect the spatial distribution, migration and transformation of UDMH in the fall places of rocket stages under conditions of subarctic which is discussed in related research article "Migration and transformation of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine in peat bog soil of rocket stage fall site in Russian North"[1]. They can be further used for understanding the UDMH transformation pathways in soils rich in organic matter and assessment of environmental impact of space rocket activities in high latitudes.

AB  - Understanding the coupled effects of climate variability and land use on riverine nitrogen is essential for watershed management. The climate-water relationships for ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) were determined by an elasticity approach and then the watershed health index was estimated using the reliability, resilience, and vulnerability framework. These methods were applied to an in-situ monitoring dataset of N concentrations measured during 2010-2017 from nine sub-watersheds in the Jiulong River Watershed, China. The results showed that temperature and precipitation elasticity of NH4-N and NO3-N changed substantially among various land use patterns. The N concentrations were highly sensitive to extreme climate conditions, particularly at urban and agricultural sub-watersheds. The measure of risk indicators revealed that the watershed health index varied from good health to unhealthy status. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze the interactions among watershed characteristics, climate elasticity, and watershed health. Cropland and population had strong positive correlations with climate elasticity of NO3-N. Forest and elevation had strong negative associations with climate elasticity of NO3-N. Watershed health significantly declined with increasing proportion of cropland and population density. This study demonstrated that human-impacted watersheds were less healthy to unhealthy and tend to be more sensitive to climate variability than natural watersheds, which is useful for efforts aimed at improving watershed management.

AB  - The aim of this work was to assess the water quality of the urban lagoon located in Parque Unzue (Gualeguaychu, Argentina) using physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters, the composition of micro-phytoplankton assemblages and functional groups (FGs) and to evaluate their annual variability. Twenty-two samplings in three stations were collected between 2015 and 2018, physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters were measured and micro-phytoplankton (20-200 mu m) was collected, identified to the lowest taxonomic level and classified in functional groups. Physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters indicated that the lagoon presented high organic pollution and no significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between sampling stations, but there were differences between the annual periods of sampling. In general, a detriment to water quality can be seen from 2015 to 2018. This was observed in the simplified water quality index (SWQI) values. Micro-phytoplankton assemblages were compounded by 48 genera distributed into Bacillariophyceae (19), Chlorophyceae (12), Cyanophyceae (7), Euglenophyceae (5), Conjugatophyceae (Zygnematophyceae) (3) and Dinophyceae (1).The Chlorophyceae group was the most sensitive to changes in the system and specifically, the genus Chlorella was an early warning indicator. Nineteen FGs were identified, and the majority were characteristic of hypereutrophic, small, turbid and highly enriched lagoons. We conclude that the lagoon located in Parque Unzue showed permanent organic pollution that kept increasing throughout the study time and therefore, that it is possible that the current conditions lead to the collapse of the system.

AB  - The article presents the results of studies on the dynamics of changes in the physicochemical parameters of wort at the stages of mechano-enzymatic treatment with increasing concentration of grain mixtures. The influence of physicochemical indices of wort on the stages of mechano-enzymatic treatment with an increase in the concentration of grain mixtures is established. Increasing the concentration of rye mixtures significantly worsens the conditions of enzymatic degradation of starch-containing raw materials in the process of mechanical and enzymatic processing. It has been established that rye processing at wort concentrations of more than 22.5 % is possible only in a mixture with triticale, which will contribute to a decrease in the yield strength of grain mixtures and wort both at the stage of mechanical and enzymatic processing and at the stage of fermentation. At the same time, the key element in the possibility of efficient processing of highly concentrated wort with a concentration of 23.5-26.9 %, both in the case of rye processing and triticale processing, is the need to develop technological methods to reduce the viscosity of the wort entering the fermentation. Combined use enzyme preparation, hydrolyzing non-starch polysaccharides, at the stages of batch preparation and saccharification showed a high perspective of this technological method, since wola get more mobile environment, entering the fermentation, providing further reduce the viscosity of the wort during fermentation.

AB  - The article presents the results of a study of the internal structure of highly elongated diamond crystals from placers in the Krasnovishersky district of the Urals. Very elongated crystals are found within diamond-bearing placer with unrevealed primary sources. Determining the conditions of such crystals formation can help one to determine the primary deposits type. There are three hypotheses for the formation of the elongated shape of such crystals: 1) crystals initially elongated along the < 100 > (strongly distorted octahedra); 2) individual crystals of columnar aggregates; 3) elongated crystals fragments. To study the internal structure, we selected three most elongated individuals of the 155 crystals samples. The study of the internal structure of selected crystals with the usage of photoluminescent (PL) tomography, cathodoluminescence (CL), and optical microscopy has shown that these samples are fragments of larger single crystals. CL imaging allowed to determine slip lines within the crystal's volume. The recorded PL spectra show the 912, 946, and 986 nm peaks, which are characteristic of crystals with plastic deformation. The revealed features are indicators of plastic deformation accompanying the destruction of the crystals. The significant dissolution following the destruction of the crystals led to the rounding of the vertices and edges of their fragments. Apparently, most of the very elongated crystals from placers with unknown sources are also highly dissolved isometric crystal fragments. The obtained results have shown that the deformation and dissolution of diamond crystals are related events characteristic of diamonds from hitherto undetected, but highly productive primary deposits.

AB  - Greater emphasis on the study of intact cellular networks in their physiological environment has led to rapid advances in intravital imaging of the central nervous system (CNS), while the peripheral system remains largely unexplored. To assess large networks of sensory neurons, we selectively label primary afferents with GCaMP6s in male and female C57bl/6 mice and visualize their functional responses to peripheral stimulation in vivo. We show that we are able to monitor the activity of hundreds of sensory neurons simultaneously, with sufficient sensitivity to detect, in most cases, single action potentials with a typical rise time of around 200 ms, and an exponential decay with a time constant of approximately 700 ms. With this technique we are able to characterize the responses of large populations of sensory neurons to innocuous and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli under normal and inflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that the majority of primary afferents are polymodal with between 50-80% of thermally sensitive DRG neurons responding also to noxious mechanical stimulation. We also specifically assess the small population of peripheral cold neurons and demonstrate significant sensitization to cooling after a model of sterile and persistent inflammation, with significantly increased sensitivity already at decreases of 5 degrees C when compared to uninflamed responses. This not only reveals interesting new insights into the (patho)physiology of the peripheral nervous system but also demonstrates the sensitivity of this imaging technique to physiological changes in primary afferents.

AB  - Stock investment is regarded as a high-risk financial activity, in which life savings can be destroyed when investors fail to consider factors in stock price variation or do not master professional knowledge and experiences related to investment. To enhance decision-making quality and profitability for investors, numerous different methods for forecasting stock market prices have appeared. However, these forecasts usually do not appear as expected because of uncertainties in the stock market. Therefore, how to effectively use stock information to help investors make stock investment decisions has become a primary issue in stock investment. Based on the bottom-up approach that considers financial conditions of listed companies, industrial environment, macroeconomics, and financial news respectively, an improved fundamental analysis-based approach for stock market forecasting is developed for selecting optimal stocks from the stock market and predicting their future price trends to provide a reference for investor decisions. This study involves the following tasks: (1) design an improved fundamental analysis-based approach to stock market forecasting; (2) develop techniques related to fundamental analysis-based stock market forecasting, and (3) demonstrate and evaluate the proposed fundamental analysis-based approach to stock market forecasting. The improved fundamental analysis-based approach to stock market forecasting involves techniques such as calculating the weight of financial indicators, evaluating and selecting individual stocks, selecting financial news features, determining stock trading signals based on financial news, and forecasting stock price trend.

AB  - The improper handling of industrial hazardous waste (IHW), which comprises large amounts of toxic chemicals, heavy metals, or irradiation substances, is a considerable threat to human health and the environment. This study aims to quantify the life cycle environmental impacts of IHW landfilling and incineration in China, to identify its key factors, to improve its potential effects, and to establish a hazardous waste disposal inventory.
   Life cycle assessment was conducted using the ReCiPe model to estimate the environmental impact of IHW landfilling and incineration. The characterization factors for the human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity categories shown in the ReCiPe were updated based on the geographies, population, food intake, and environmental conditions in China.
   The overall environmental burden was mainly attributed to the carcinogen category. The national carcinogen burden in 2014 at 37.8 CTUh was dominated by diesel consumption, cement and sodium hydroxide production, direct emission, transportation, and electricity generation stages caused by direct mercury and arsenic emissions, as well as indirect chromium emission. Although the atmospheric mercury emission directly caused by IHW incineration was comparative with the emission levels of developed countries, the annual direct mercury emission accounted for approximately 0.1% of the national mercury emission.
   The key factors contributing to the reduction of the national environmental burden include the increasing diesel and electricity consumption efficiency, the reduction of cement and sodium hydroxide use, the development of air pollutant controlling systems, the reduction of transport distance between IHW disposers to suppliers, and the improvement of IHW recycling and reuse technologies.

AB  - Linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) has been utilised in human bioarchaeology as an indicator of growth disturbance during childhood. However, only a few studies have compared populations of different socio-economic status in the same time period. This study examines the association between the LEH occurrence pattern and social status in the 18th to 19th century populations in Japan. Detailed archaeological studies on burials from the Edo period (1603-1867) excavated in Tokyo have facilitated estimating an individual's social status by its burial type. In this study, 112 individuals from the Sugenji-Shokenji site were divided into three burial structure groups (ceramic jar coffins formiddle-class warriors, wooden square coffins for low-class warriors and townspeople and wooden circular coffins for townspeople) and examined for the general prevalence of LEH, number of LEH and the chronological distribution of LEH. A high general prevalence of LEH was observed in every group, especially in lower canine (79.3-100.0%). However, individuals in the jar coffin group showed a lower prevalence and smaller number of LEH per tooth, suggesting that individuals of higher social status experienced better living environments in their childhood. There was no significant difference in the chronological distribution of LEH formation between coffin groups. Such data are essential for understanding the association between socio-economic status and living conditions in specific societies in the past. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Variation in body form among human groups is structured by a blend of natural selection driven by local climatic conditions and random genetic drift. However, attempts to test ecogeographic hypotheses have not distinguished between adaptive traits (i.e., those that evolved as a result of selection) and those that evolved as a correlated response to selection on other traits (i.e., nonadaptive traits), complicating our understanding of the relationship between climate and morphological distinctions among populations. Here, we use evolutionary quantitative methods to test if traits previously identified as supporting ecogeographic hypotheses were actually adaptive by estimating the force of selection on individual traits needed to drive among-group differentiation. Our results show that not all associations between trait means and latitude were caused by selection acting directly on each individual trait. Although radial and tibial length and biiliac and femoral head breadth show signs of responses to directional selection matching ecogeographic hypotheses, the femur was subject to little or no directional selection despite having shorter values by latitude. Additionally, in contradiction to ecogeographic hypotheses, the humerus was under directional selection for longer values by latitude. Responses to directional selection in the tibia and radius induced a nonadaptive correlated response in the humerus that overwhelmed its own trait-specific response to selection. This result emphasizes that mean differences between groups are not good indicators of which traits are adaptations in the absence of information about covariation among characteristics.

AB  - Hydro-chemical and isotopic data from different aquifers in the Great Hungarian Plain (the central part of the Pannonian Basin) were evaluated down to a depth of 2,740 m. The chemical and isotopic composition of water is influenced by its origin and by chemical and mixing processes. The analytical data and chemical considerations, together with geology, pressure conditions and evolution history of the area, explain the evolution of the subsurface water. Most of the samples are of meteoric origin, but there were some samples with a non-meteoric contribution, as indicated by the water stable isotopes, and these were identified as seawater trapped during the sedimentation in Lake Pannon. The sea contribution is traceable by the shifts in delta O-18 and delta H-2 and the chemical composition of the water, and is explained with an upward-driving force. Chemical considerations and spatial variability of the dissolved components suggest that distinct water bodies, each with a specific origin and chemical evolution, can be separately identified. Although in the Quaternary layers there are water bodies that can be considered to display complete flow systems (from recharge to discharge), in most water bodies present infiltration was not identified. The lack of recent recharge to several water bodies in various places and depths suggests a separation of the recharge and the discharge that occurred not in space, but in time. A possible explanation of the cessation of recharge is a significant change in the hydraulic circumstances, probably the surface elevation.

AB  - The Wenlock (middle Silurian) Eramosa Lagerstatte of the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario, Canada, is becoming known for its rich and diverse faunas, different preservational styles, and a combination of soft-body preservation associated with shelly body and trace fossils. Sampling for scolecodonts-the jaws of polychaete annelids-has yielded unique material. Hindenites parkheadensis new species is described from abundant specimens, including apparatuses, from a monospecific fauna that has allowed the complete dorsal maxillary apparatus to be reconstructed. The new species was recovered by acid digestion of carbonates, which are interpreted as having been deposited in shallow, marginally marine environments; the species may become a useful paleoenvironmental indicator, and the occurrence of Hindenites at Park Head, Ontario, is the first record of the genus outside of Baltoscandia. Bedding-plane material from Wiarton, Ontario, reveals a more diverse fauna of seven to nine additional polychaete taxa, most belonging to Kettnerites and Oenonites. Strata at Wiarton are interpreted as having been deposited in environments with good water circulation and open-marine conditions. The faunal composition of Eramosa polychaetes varied between localities of the Lagerstatte outcrop belt, supporting previous interpretations of differences in environment and/or taphonomic history. The relative abundance of scolecodonts suggests that jaw-bearing polychaetes played a significant role in the biotas that are now preserved in the Eramosa Lagerstatte. Moreover, the results underpin the notion that different polychaete species had variable environmental preferences and tolerances during the Silurian, and that polychaetaspids and paulinitids formed two of the most common and widely distributed families.

AB  - During the Croatian Homeland war in 1991, the capacitor batteries of the Zadar electric power substation (TS 110/35 kV) were damaged, resulting in the severe pollution of the soil with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Due to porosity of karstic soil PCBs represent great environmental and human health risks that need some action. The polluted soil was collected and an experimental field was formed. This paper reports the behaviour of PCBs in karstic soil over an extended period of time under field conditions. Vertical movement of PCBs through the soil profiles was also observed. The soil was sampled four times. The initial median levels of Aroclor 1248 in the surface soil layer were 76.5 mu g g(-1). The levels of PCB in the soil layers collected after initial stage were quite variable. In general, PCB patterns were dominated by low-chlorinated homologue groups (<5 Cl groups). The dominant indicator PCB congeners initially present in the soil were PCB 28 and PCB 52. At the end of the experiment, in surface soil layer, the levels of PCB 28 decreased significantly (38%), while the levels of PCB 52 decreased at a smallier rate with time (15%). In the observed time periods the levels of higher PCBs (n>6) were relatively stable. The results show that the total PCB concentration in the soil around the roots significantly dropped by 36% while in the deeper soil layer decreased for 18%.

AB  - An urban climate analysis system for Seoul was combined with biometeorological models for the spatially distributed assessment of heat stress risks. The Biometeorological Climate impact Assessment System (BioCAS) is based on the Climate Analysis Seoul (CAS) workbench which provides urban planners with gridded data relevant for local climate assessment at 25 m and 5 m spatial resolutions. The influence of building morphology and vegetation on mean radiant temperature T-mrt was simulated by the SOLWEIG model. Gridded hourly perceived temperature PT was computed using the Klima-Michel Model for a hot day in 2012. Daily maximum perceived temperature PTmax was then derived from these data and applied to an empirical-statistical model that explains the relationship between PTmax and excess mortality rate r(EM) in Seoul. The resultant rEM map quantifies the detrimental impact of hot weather at the building scale. Mean (maximum) values of rEM in old and new town areas in an urban re-development site in Seoul were estimated at 2.3 % (50.7 %) and 0 % (8.6 %), respectively, indicating that urban re-development in the new town area has generally resulted in a strong reduction of heat-stress related mortality. The study illustrates that BioCAS can generally be applied for the quantification of the impacts of hot weather on human health for different urban development scenarios. Further improvements are required, particularly to consider indoor climate conditions causing heat stress, as well as socio-economic status and population structure of local residents.

AB  - Wetlands have been the focus of conflicts in societal priorities throughout human history, with competing demands for water and land use delivering a range of ecosystem services but contributing to severe degradation and loss. Conservation of wetlands is a relatively recent priority, and it has seen more recent shifts from protection of remaining wetlands initially as a static biodiversity resource towards a focus on the many, formerly largely undervalued beneficial functions that these ecosystems provide to society.
   The UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) assesses the status, trends, ecosystem services and future prospects of eight broad habitat types, including wetlands. Despite confounding factors such as an inconsistent inventory of wetlands, fragmented policy instruments and conflicts with agricultural land use, the NEA has enabled an initial assessment of the extent and condition of the current wetland resource in the UK and the degree of loss of different wetland types and their broad implications not only for biodiversity, but for the delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services. It has also highlighted some of the ways in which wetland ecosystem services can be beneficially exploited, for example as buffer zones, as a means to protect freshwater resources or in flood risk management, as well as the trade-offs inherent in different land uses. We summarise some of the findings of the NEA in relation to some key challenges of linking wetland science to policy. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Theory predicts that not all plant species will be equally affected by disruption to their pollinator mutualisms because traits such as breeding system and mutualism strength can affect their response. We investigated these traits in three species of Afromontane mistletoe Globimetula braunii, Agelanthus brunneus and A. djurensis in Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve, Nigeria, to test whether the traits were reliable indicators of relative reproductive success and could be used to predict relative vulnerability to pollinator loss. For each mistletoe species, insect and bird visitors were identified during a 160-240-min observation period of 4-10 plants and their roles in flower opening and fruit set were investigated using exclusion experiments applied to 250-500 flowers. We found that all three mistletoes are self-compatible but not capable of autonomous self-fertilization. The pollinator assemblage comprised four species of sunbird (Cyanomitris spp., Cinnyris spp.) and a small social wasp (Vespinae). None of the mistletoes requires birds for flower opening: G. braunii flowers self-opened in the absence of pollinators, whereas insects opened both Agelanthus spp. Irrespective of flower opening, each mistletoe species requires sunbirds for effective pollination and fruit set. Only G. braunii demonstrated pollen limitation (pollen limitation index = 0.504) which may be an early indication of mutualism breakdown. We suggest that mistletoes be considered as indicators of habitat condition and functioning within Afromontane forest ecosystems.

AB  - Nestling growth is known as an important determinant of fitness in altricial birds, but its evolutionary potential has been debated, and little is known about detailed patterns of current selection on growth. Relationships are often reported between nestling growth and attributes of nestlings and parents, but the interpretation of these depends on the advantages a given growth difference confers to the chicks. Increased growth may have positive, negative or context-dependent effects on offspring fitness, but these effects are largely unknown in natural populations. We measured growth trajectories of body mass in fostered broods of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) in 3 years of contrasting food conditions. We examined the growth of young and their recruitment probability to the breeding population in relation to year quality, hatching rank, sex, paternal age and paternal attractiveness. We also looked at the interactive effects of growth and intrinsic offspring attributes on recruitment probability. The predictors of nestling growth and those of recruitment did not agree. Moreover, the recruitment consequences of a given nestling growth rate were significantly influenced by nestling rank and paternal ornamentation. Differential recruitment effects of nestling growth in relation to parental traits and nestling attributes suggest that using growth as a generally applicable measure of nestling quality may not be justified. These findings also have implications for morphological evolution and the indicator value of sexual signals.

AB  - Milkfat globule membranes (MFGMs) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. These membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri. Assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (BHI) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. Under these experimental conditions, MFGMs were most active against Salmonella Typhimurium and P. fluorescens. However, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. We determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on BHI plates were due to the generation of H2O2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the MFGMs, as a result of purine catalysis. This substrate is present in BHI but lacking in LB medium. Evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends. The growth of probiotic Lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when grown on lactobacilli deMan Rogosa Sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to H2O2. In this study, several MFGM hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with M9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. The probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. Bovine MFGM fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.

AB  - Studies carried out in different countries correlate social, economic, environmental, and health factors with the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19. However, such studies do not reveal which factors make one country more exposed to COVID-19 than other. Based on the composite indicators approach, this research identifies the factors that most impact the number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 worldwide and measures countries' exposure to COVID-19. Three composite indicators of exposure to COVID-19 were constructed through Principal Component Analysis, Simple Additive Weighting, and k-means clustering. The number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 is strongly correlated (R > 0.60) with composite indicator scores and moderately concordant (K > 0.4) with country clusters. Factors directly or indirectly associated with the age of the population are the ones that most expose countries to COVID-19. The population of countries most exposed to COVID-19 is 12 years older on average. The proportion of the elderly population in these countries is at least twice that of countries less exposed to COVID-19. Factors that can increase the population's life expectancy, such as Gross Domestic Product per capita and the Human Development Index, are four times and 1.3 times higher in more exposed countries to COVID-19. Providing better living conditions increases both the population's life expectancy and the country's exposure to COVID-19.

AB  - The development of semiconductor photocatalyst with simple and controllable components, high catalytic efficiency and cycle stability, and diversified degradation goals is an important condition for achieving large-scale commercial applications for environmental remediation. The achievement of these important performance indicators requires the precise modulation of the components and the clarification of the photocatalysis process and charge transfer mechanisms. In this work, we have fabricated a heterostructured photocatalyst composed of graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets and MoO3 nanoparticles through a simple mixing and annealing process. The compound exhibits effective visible light photocatalytic activity for both rhodamine (RhB) and methyl orange (MO). In the evaluation of RhB catalytic performance, the optimized heterojunction photocatalyst achieves extremely high visible light photocatalytic performance with a small amount of catalyst (0.1 g/L). It is characterized by nearly 100% degradation rate within 24 min. The kinetic constant k is 0.11 min(-1), and the cycle stability is 100% after four cycles. Direct Z-scheme charge transfer is established based on the measurement of energy level positions, free radical scavenging experiment and electrochemical analysis. Electrons accumulate in the g-C3N4 conduction band while holes remain in the MoO3 valence band, maintaining a high redox potential and promoting effective carrier separation. Superoxide radicals and holes play a prominent role in photocatalytic degradation, and the role of hydroxyl radicals cannot be ignored.

AB  - In the last few decades, saliva due to its non-invasive nature has been highlighted as an important diagnostic biofluid and significant alteration in its composition has been reported with the progression of diabetes. We have investigated the best protocol for saliva collection, handling and processing to leverage its full potential for measuring salivary electrochemical parameters (SEPs) that serve as proxy indicators for fasting blood glucose levels (BGLs) in the body. SEPs such as pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), conductivity and concentrations of Na+, K+ and Ca++ ions were examined in a total of 60 age and sex matched (healthy and with diabetes) volunteers over three days (study 1) and during five different intervals in a day (study 2) and were subjected to statistical analysis. Effect of different age groups were also considered in study 2. None of the SEPs showed significant day-to-day variability (p > 0.05) in an individual belonging to either group. The variation among individuals was, however, higher in the diabetes group. The average SEP values were also distinctly different from the healthy baseline in the saliva collected after overnight fasting (P < 0.05). These findings imply that consumption of meals alters the salivary secretion and limits the use of the saliva-based studies to fasting intervals, which stands best for the salivary analysis during the diseased condition. Overall, we conclude that the SEPs collection protocol should be fixed to overnight fasting with 15 min of prior gargling.

AB  - Background: Microbiomes play vital roles in plant health and performance, and the development of plant beneficial microbiomes can be steered by organic fertilizer inputs. Especially well-studied are fertilizer-induced changes on bacteria and fungi and how changes in these groups alter plant performance. However, impacts on protist communities, including their trophic interactions within the microbiome and consequences on plant performance remain largely unknown. Here, we tracked the entire microbiome, including bacteria, fungi, and protists, over six growing seasons of cucumber under different fertilization regimes (conventional, organic, and Trichoderma bio-organic fertilization) and linked microbial data to plant yield to identify plant growth-promoting microbes.
   Results: Yields were higher in the (bio-)organic fertilization treatments. Soil abiotic conditions were altered by the fertilization regime, with the prominent effects coming from the (bio-)organic fertilization treatments. Those treatments also led to the pronounced shifts in protistan communities, especially microbivorous cercozoan protists. We found positive correlations of these protists with plant yield and the density of potentially plant-beneficial microorganisms. We further explored the mechanistic ramifications of these relationships via greenhouse experiments, showing that cercozoan protists can positively impact plant growth, potentially via interactions with plant-beneficial microorganisms including Trichoderma, the biological agent delivered by the bio-fertilizer.
   Conclusions: We show that protists may play central roles in stimulating plant performance through microbiome interactions. Future agricultural practices might aim to specifically enhance plant beneficial protists or apply those protists as novel, sustainable biofertilizers.

AB  - The unprecedented 2012 summer drought over the central United States was characterized by rapid intensification and severe impact and was known as a flash drought. Since then, flash drought has raised a wide concern, with considerable progresses on the definition, detection of anthropogenic footprints, and assessment of ecological impact. However, physical mechanisms related to the flash drought predictability remain unclear. Here, we show that the severity of the 2012 flash drought will be heavily underestimated without realistic initial soil moisture condition. The global Weather Research and Forecasting (GWRF) model was employed during the summers of 1979-2012, driven by observed sea surface temperature but without lateral boundary controls, which is similar to two-tier global seasonal prediction. The 2012 United States drought pattern was roughly captured by the GWRF ensemble global simulations, although with obvious underestimation of the severity. To further diagnose the role of soil moisture memory, dry and wet simulations that decrease and increase initial soil moisture by 10% were conducted. While the dry case does not significantly differ from the control case, the wet case totally missed the drought over the Central and Southern Great Plains by changing the anticyclonic circulation anomaly to a cyclonic anomaly and simulating a northward anomaly of meridional wind that brought anomalous moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and finally resulted in a failure to predict the drought. This study highlights the importance of soil moisture memory in predicting flash drought that often occurred without strong oceanic signal.

AB  - The development of simple, fast, cheap and reliable analytical methods for tracing biological indicators is demanded through clinical investigations. Herein, we developed, for the first time, a cheap and specific method for the extraction and quantification of p-cresol (pC) in real plasma samples of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Plasma samples were prepared by hydrolyzing in an acidic medium to convert pCS (p-cresol sulfate) and p-Cresol glucuronide (pCG) to pC. Next, proteins of plasma samples were precipitated and then pC was extracted by acetonitrile (ACN) and saturated NaCl (as salting-out agent). Finally, fluorescence emissions were measured at lambda(ex)/lambda(em) = 280/310 nm. The specificity of the method was checked by testing various possible interfering agents. The obtained results revealed a specific determination of pC. Under optimal conditions, a linear range was detected from 0.5 to 30 mu g/mL of pC with a lower limit of detection (LLOQ) of 0.5 mu g/mL. The reliability of the method was checked by calculating the repeatability, selectivity, and accuracy of the developed method for pC determination in plasma samples. The application of the developed method was investigated for the detection of pC in a number of CKD patients. Due to the simplicity and selectivity, the developed method could be applied for routine analysis of pC concentrations in the plasma samples of CKD patients. In addition, the developed method showed great potential for developing a point-of-care testing (POCT) device.

AB  - Parametric water quality indexing (WQI) helps integrate the interwoven effects of independent parameters which may enhance or impair the desirable physico-chemical and biological characteristics of both surface waters and groundwater reserves. Monsoon and post-monsoon status of the distribution of such parameters will give an insight on improvising the qualities of water for multiple usages in the vicinity of a tank and its influential area on groundwater contamination. A typical system tank in Coimbatore urban reach of the Noyyal river was studied by using GIS applications. The test values of all parameters considered were subjected to indexing for water quality grades inflicted by the presence of contaminants. On a 1 to 5 gradation, the study area was found to have a weighted mean water quality index of 2.34 and 2.35 for tank surface water during the monsoon and post-monsoon periods, respectively. In case of ground water sampling, the same was found to be 2.17 and 2.19 for the respective situations. The overall hazard rating was characterized under medium to high, warranting quarantine measures to safeguard the water quality standards for multiple uses in the study locality, pinning the eyes on dissolved oxygen improvements, turbidity control mechanisms, alkalinity amendments and moderations of hardness prevailing as high hazard indicators. The pre-monsoon season ratings were nearing the critical conditions at overall ratings ranging from 3.03 to 2.65 (high to severe) for surface and groundwater, respectively.

AB  - Emissions related to economic activities including shipping and its contribution to the degradation of air quality, health and built environment in port-cities increasingly raise attention. Sustained market growth and shipping, also deriving into pollution concentration and an exposure increase over residents and visitors, stresses the need to identify and internalize environmental impacts. In order enhance abatement actions towards shipping sectors, this paper estimates for the first time the environmental cost and eco-efficiency performance indicators from vessel traffic in general and passenger sub-sectors in particular under diverse geographical and regulatory contexts. Emission assessment (NOx, SOx, PM2.5, CO and CO2) of EU (Las Palmas), non-EU but SECA (St. Petersburg) and non-EU non-SECA (Hong Kong) ports is based on the full bottom-up Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) and messages transmitted by the Automatic Identification System (AIS) over a twelve-month period. Environmental cost is obtained from a top-down approach and the latest seaport-related cost figures. At last, eco-efficiency performance indicators are presented as the ratio of product/service impacts (externality costs) its added value (port profiles). Results present a first approximation to the externality cost of shipping traffic by sea and in port. Conclusions support international and regional policy design within the selected harbours and ports under similar traffic conditions.

AB  - Marine bivalves are well known for their impressive lifespans. Like trees, bivalves grow by accretion and record age and size throughout ontogeny in their shell. Bivalves, however, can form growth increments at several different periodicities depending on their local environment. Thus, establishing lifespans and growth rates of marine bivalves requires a proper identification of annual growth increments. Here, we use isotope sclerochronology to decipher the accretionary growth record of modern Astarte borealis from the White Sea, Russia (N 67A degrees 05.70'; E 32A degrees 40.85'). Unlike winter growth increments observed in many other cold-temperate and boreal bivalve and limpet species, prominent growth increments in A. borealis corresponded to the most negative values in the oxygen isotope (delta O-18) time series indicating that they formed during summer. Furthermore, summer growth increments do not coincide with the external concentric ridges on the shell making the latter feature an unreliable indicator of age. Similar to many other polar bivalves, A. borealis shows slow growth and long life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation for our sample is H (t) = 29.39*(1 - e ((- 0.11(t-(- 1.86)))). Lifespans of individuals examined here (n = 18) range from 16 to 48 years. Given its impressive longevity and widespread polar distribution, A. borealis may be a potentially valuable skeletal archive for monitoring environmental conditions in the Arctic Ocean and boreal seas in the face of changing climate.

AB  - Zooplankton from clear alpine lakes is exposed to stressful levels of solar UV radiation (UVR). As these pelagic organisms experience high UVR and large changes in solar radiation conditions between ice-free and ice-cover periods, they have evolved various strategies to minimize UVR exposure and damage. Here, we studied the relation between photoprotection levels (mycosporine-like amino adds, carotenoids), antioxidant capacities, and gene expression of heat shock proteins (hsps) as indicator of stress in the copepod Cyclops abyssorum tatricus during the course of a year. Expression of hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90 was measured in the field (baseline expression [BE]) and after UVR exposure in the laboratory. The BE differed among genes and seasons (hsp60: high during summer, hsp70 and hsp90: high during the ice-cover period). The gene expression of hsp70 was upregulated after exposure to UVR (up to 5.2-fold change), while hsp60 and hsp90 were only constitutively expressed. A strong seasonal pattern was found in the photoprotective compounds and antioxidant capacities, with highest levels during the ice-free period. The extent of upregulation of hsp70 gene expression increased with decreasing photoprotection levels and peaked 24 h post UVR exposure (9.6-fold change) at the time of lowest photoprotection (February). Our data suggest that hsp70 gene expression is modulated by seasonal plasticity in photoprotection. This ability of adequate stress response is essential for survival in highly variable ecosystems such as alpine lakes.

AB  - Herbicides are pollutants of great concern due to environmental ubiquity resulting from extensive use in modern agriculture and persistence in soil and water. Studies at various spatial scales have also highlighted frequent occurrences of major herbicide breakdown products in the environment. Analysis of plant behavior toward such molecules and their metabolites under conditions of transient or persistent soil pollution is important for toxicity evaluation in the context of environmental risk assessment. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the action of such environmental contaminants, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which has been shown to be highly responsive to pesticides and other xenobiotics, was confronted with varying levels of the widely-used herbicide atrazine and of two of its metabolites, desethylatrazine and hydroxyatrazine, which are both frequently detected in water streams of agriculturally-intensive areas. After 24 h of exposure to varying concentrations covering the range of triazine concentrations detected in the environment, root-level contaminations of atrazine, desethylatrazine and hydroxyatrazine were found to affect early growth and development in various dose-dependent and differential manners. Moreover, these differential effects of atrazine, desethylatrazine and hydroxyatrazine pointed to the involvement of distinct mechanisms directly affecting respiration and root development. The consequences of the identification of additional targets, in addition to the canonical photosystem II target, are discussed in relation with the ecotoxicological assessment of environmental xenobiotic contamination.

AB  - In this paper, a reusable electrochemical biosensor was developed for highly sensitive detection of mercury ions (Hg2+) using an anionic intercalator, which was based on Hg2+-induced conformational change of a thymine-rich, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) supported on the platform of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) and self-doped polyaniline (SPAN) nanofibers. In the presence of Hg2+, the mercury-specific oligonucleotides were induced and folded into hairpin structure through mismatched thymine-Hg2+-thymine (T-Hg2+-T) base pairs from random coils. Then, the indicators intercalated into the hairpin structure and increased electric signal. OMC and SPAN nanofibers possessed excellent electrical conductivity which synergistically accelerated electron transfer and greatly improved the efficiency of electrochemical reaction at the electrode interface. Meanwhile, SPAN nanofibers strongly adhered to the electrode surface and attached rod-like OMC homogeneously and firmly, which provided a stable platform for DNA immobilization. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit (LOD) for He. was 0.6 fM (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the biosensor could be easily regenerated by cysteine for cyclic utilization. Some environmental samples including lake sediment pore water and tap water were analyzed by the developed biosensor, the relatively satisfactory results indicated that it provided a green and promising strategy for detection of trace Hg2+ in the practical application.

AB  - In modern conditions of globalization of information flows, an important role is played by methods of processing and analysis of economic data. The prevailing number of methods is based on economic-mathematical models, their concepts, principles and methods. The latent nature of information about latent processes and phenomena, the lack of completeness of its provision require the use of special analysis methods that constitute one of the aspects of the economic-mathematical approach to constructing a model of an unobserved economy. One approach to solving this problem is to construct a correlation-regression model of an unobserved economy in which an unobserved economy acts as an endogenous variable. It is an unknown parameter to be determined.
   When conducting correlation-regression analysis, the mechanism of concealment of funds during cashing operations at a large industrial enterprise with the participation of front companies for the purpose of evading taxes is considered. The object of the study is a business process for cashing cash. The input and output indicators of the business process for cashing cash are classified.
   A matrix of responsibility of the main participants of the business process for transferring noncash funds to unaccounted-for cash has been developed. On the basis of expert and estimated estimates, models of time series of hidden profit are constructed. The possibilities of determining the output quantitative characteristics of cash withdrawal operations based on building a business process model are justified.

AB  - The adsorptive potential of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BNNSs) for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of pollutants was investigated for the first time. Seven indicators of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were selected as target analytes. The adsorption of PCBs on the surface of the h-BNNSs in water was simulated by the density functional theory and molecular dynamics. The simulation results indicated that the PCBs are adsorbed on the surface by pi-pi, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. The PCBs were extracted with an h-BNNS-packed SPE cartridge, and eluted by dichloromethane. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry working in the multiple reaction monitor mode was used for the sample quantification. The effect of extraction parameters, including the flow rate, pH value, breakthrough volume, and the ionic strength, were investigated. Under the optimal working conditions, the developed method showed low limits of detection (0.24-0.50 ng L-1; signal-to-noise ratio = 3:1), low limits of quantification (0.79-1.56 ng L-1; signal-to-noise ratio = 10:1), satisfactory linearity (r > 0.99) within the concentration range of 2-1000 ng L-1, and good precision (relative standard deviation < 12%). The PCBs concentration in environmental water samples was determined by the developed method. This results demonstrate that h-BNNSs have high analytical potential in the enrichment of pollutants.

AB  - Coniferous phytoliths in sediments are an effective tool for detecting the historical appearance of conifers. However, at the timberline in mountainous areas, such coniferous phytoliths are easily confused with grass phytoliths. This study analyses modern phytoliths from 17 conifer plants. Six common types and six rare types were identified. The conifers studied produce abundant blocky polyhedral and cubic (in the average 30-40 mu m size range), blocky scrobiculate (average 30-40 mu m), tabular elongate unsculpted (length 50-100 mu m, width 10-20 mu m), tabular elongate cavate (length 50-150 mu m, width 10 mu m), tabular elongate dendritic (50-100 mu m x 10-20 mu m), and irregular oblong (20-40 mu m) phytoliths. This paper aims to show morphological characteristics of coniferous phytoliths in China, and to show how the common coniferous phytoliths differ from similar grass phytolith types, such as blocky polyhedral coniferous phytoliths from silicified parallelepipedal bulliform cells produced by grass. Blocky polyhedral and cubic phytoliths are the commonest coniferous phytoliths found in the sediments, but need to be carefully distinguished from grass parallelepipedal bulliform cells. This study indicates that clearly protruding ridges and irregular inward edges are essential features of cubic and polyhedral morphotypes produced by conifers. Results of this paper might provide important material for the study of paleovegetation and paleoecology of mountainous areas, especially at the timberline.

AB  - To assess the toxic effects of three pesticides on non-target organism, we exposed the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny 1826) to artificial soil supplemented with different concentrations of the examined pesticides based on the recommended agricultural doses (RAD). Their commercial formulations are: Galition G-5 (insecticide: active ingredient, a.i., malathion and fenitrothion), Terbis (herbicide: a.i. terbuthylazine), and Gardene (limacide: a.i. metaldehyde). The laboratory test was conducted according to the OECD guidelines. Mortality, biomass, and growth inhibition were chosen as toxic endpoints. No death was recorded at the lowest concentration (1/4 RAD) of the insecticide or the limacide after 7- and 14-day exposures, nor was it recorded at the highest concentration (4x RAD) of the insecticide or the limacide after 7-day exposure. Triazine herbicide Terbis was found the most toxic and ecologically dangerous to E. fetida, because it LC50 value (1.26 mg kg(-1)) was very close to the respective RAD and the growth inhibition in all concentrations was significantly positive. Although E. fetida was found susceptible to the organophosphorus insecticide Galition, due to the significant positive growth inhibition at the highest concentration, the value of LC50 was higher than its RAD. On the other hand, metaldehyde limacide Gardena was found ecologically safe because the LC50 value was higher than its RAD and weight was not significantly changed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Ozone is a highly unpredictable pollutant which severely affects living conditions in urban and surrounding areas in the Mediterranean basin. This secondary pollutant periodically reaches extremely high concentrations, damaging human health. Multiple linear regression has been widely used in previous works due to the fact that it is a simple and versatile method for forecasting ozone concentrations. However, these models usually prove their validity using fulfillment of statistical constraints, ignoring other intrinsic characteristics existing in the time series, such as the temporal scaling behavior and the data distribution over different time scales. In previous works, it has been demonstrated that observed ozone time series are of a multifractal nature, meaning that the data distribution can be described by using the multifractal spectrum. This work focuses on the capacity of a forecasting model to reproduce the scaling features existing in an observed time series when several chemical and meteorological explanatory variables are introduced following the stepwise procedure. A comparison between the observed spectrum and the simulated ones for each step is used to check which explanatory variables better reproduce the multifractal nature in real ozone time series. It has been confirmed that a model with few explanatory variables allows reproducing the multifractal nature in the simulated time series with an acceptable accuracy without compromising the values of the coefficient of determination and root-mean-squared error, which were used as performance indicators.

AB  - The environmental risk assessment of toxic chemicals in stream water requires the use of a low cost standardized toxicity bioassay. Here, a biosensor for detection of toxic chemicals in stream water was studied using sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB) in continuous mode. The biosensor depends on the ability of SOB to oxidize sulfur particles under aerobic conditions to produce sulfuric acid. The reaction results in an increase in electrical conductivity (EC) and a decrease in pH. The biosensor is based on the inhibition of SOB in the presence of toxic chemicals by measuring changes in EC and pH. We found that the SOB biosensor can detect Cr6+ at a low concentration (50 ppb) which is lower than many whole-cell biosensors. The effect of organic material in real stream water on SOB activity was studied. Due to the presence of mixotrophic SOB, we found that the presence of organic matter increases SOB activity which decreases the biosensor start up period. Low alkalinity (22 mg L-1 CaCO3) increased effluent EC and decreased effluent pH which is optimal for biosensor operation. While at high alkalinity (820 mg L-1 CaCO3, the activity of SOB little decreased. We found that system can detect 50 ppb of Cr6+ F at low alkalinity (22 mg L-1 CaCO3) in few hours while, complete inhibition was observed after 35 h of operation at high alkalinity (820 mg L-1 CaCO3.

AB  - Extreme heat is a leading cause of weather-related fatalities worldwide. Emphasis is currently being placed on the development of spatially specific vulnerability models, which are useful for decision support during extreme heat events (EHE). Research results concerning such spatially-explicit models lead efforts in preparation and mitigation of heat-related vulnerability and potential adaptation. The presented research analyzes the 1995 Chicago EHE in the context of a socio-environmental hazards approach, and fosters the development of an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI). The EHVI is a fused dataset consisting of census data and remotely sensed variables, which are examined in relation to geocoded mortality data. The presented analysis combines 25 well-known indicators of extreme risk into an applied index utilizing a principal components analysis. The developed EHVI presented a trend of higher rates of death in the highest risk zones to lower rates in lower zones of risk. The model explains nearly 80% of the total variance in the heat-health vulnerability variables utilized. This index could be utilized by city officials to assist in the mitigation of extreme heat events and is a further evolution of previously developed efforts. Our findings indicate extreme heat vulnerability models should likely be developed on a local level for a specific location, taking into account local variations in social and environmental vulnerability.

AB  - Zhang, Jin, Wang, Lanfang, and Wang, Susheng-Financial development and economic growth: Recent evidence from China
   Using data from 286 Chinese cities over the period 2001-2006, this paper investigates the relationship between financial development and economic growth at the city level in China. Our results from both traditional cross-sectional regressions and first-differenced and system GMM estimators for dynamic panel data suggest that most traditional indicators of financial development are positively associated with economic growth. This result runs contrary to the existing conclusion that a state-ruled banking sector, such as that in China, hinders economic growth because of the distorting nature of the government. Since we focus on the years after China's accession to the World Trade Organization (yam in 2001 while the existing studies mainly covered the years before 2001, our finding suggests that the financial reforms that have taken place after China's accession to the WTO are in the right direction. To examine the sensitivity of our results, different conditioning information sets are experimented with. Our results are shown to be robust. Journal of Comparative Economics 40 (3) (2012) 393-412.

AB  - Sediment records from closed-basin lakes in the Northern Great Plains (NGP) of North America have contributed significantly to our understanding of regional paleoclimatology. A high-resolution (near decadal) fossil diatom record from Kettle Lake, ND, USA that spans the last 8500 cal. yr BP is interpreted in concert with percent abundance of aragonite in the sediment as an independent proxy of groundwater flow to the lake (and thus lake water level). Kettle Lake has been relatively fresh for the majority of the Holocene, likely because of the coarse substrata and a strong connection to the underlying aquifer. Interpretation of diatom assemblages in four groups indicative of low to high groundwater flow, based on the percent of aragonite in sediments, allow interpretations of arid periods (and probable meromictic lake conditions) that could not be detected based on diatom-based salinity reconstructions alone. At the centennial-millennial scale, the diatom record suggests humid/wet periods from 8351 to 8088, 4364 to 1406 and 872 to 620 cal. yr BP, with more arid periods intervening. During the last similar to 4500 years, decadal-centennial scale periods of drought have taken place, despite the generally wetter climate. These droughts appear to have had similar impacts on the Kettle Lake hydrology as the 'Dust Bowl' era droughts, but were longer in duration.

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N1, was first officially reported in Indonesia in 2004. Since then the disease has spread and is now endemic in large parts of the country. This study investigated the statistical relationship between a set of risk factors and the presence or absence of HPAI in Indonesia during 2006 and 2007. HPAI was evaluated through participatory disease surveillance (PDS) in backyard village chickens (the study population), and risk factors included descriptors of people and poultry distribution (separating chickens, ducks and production sectors), poultry movement patterns and agro-ecological conditions.
   The study showed that the risk factors "elevation", "human population density" and "rice cropping" were significant in accounting for the spatial variation of the PDS-defined HPAI cases. These findings were consistent with earlier studies in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition "commercial poultry population", and two indicators of market locations and transport; "human settlements" and "road length", were identified as significant risk factors in the models. In contrast to several previous studies carried out in Southeast Asia, domestic backyard ducks were not found to be a significant risk factor in Indonesia. The study used surrogate estimates of market locations and marketing chains and further work should focus on the actual location of the live bird markets, and on the flow of live poultry and poultry products between them, so that patterns of possible transmission, and regions of particular risk could be better inferred.

AB  - Understanding how amyloid-beta peptide interacts with living cells on a molecular level is critical to development of targeted treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Evidence that oligomeric A beta interacts with neuronal cell membranes has been provided, but the mechanism by which membrane binding occurs and the exact stoichiometry of the neurotoxic aggregates remain elusive. Physiologically relevant experimentation is hindered by the high A beta concentrations required for most biochemical analyses, the metastable nature of A beta aggregates, and the complex variety of A beta species present under physiological conditions. Here we use single molecule microscopy to overcome these challenges, presenting direct optical evidence that small A beta(1-40) oligomers bind to living neuroblastoma cells at physiological A beta concentrations. Single particle fluorescence intensity measurements indicate that cell-bound A beta species range in size from monomers to hexamers and greater, with the majority of bound oligomers falling in the dimer-to-tetramer range. Furthermore, while low-molecular weight oligomeric species do form in solution, the membrane-bound oligomer size distribution is shifted towards larger aggregates, indicating either that bound A beta oligomers can rapidly increase in size or that these oligomers cluster at specific sites on the membrane. Calcium indicator studies demonstrate that small oligomer binding at physiological concentrations induces only mild, sporadic calcium leakage. These findings support the hypothesis that small oligomers are the primary A beta species that interact with neurons at physiological concentrations.

AB  - Protein thermodynamic stability is a fundamental physical characteristic that determines biological function. Furthermore, alteration of thermodynamic stability by macromolecular interactions or biochemical modifications is a powerful tool for assessing the relationship between protein structure, stability, and biological function. High-throughput approaches for quantifying protein stability are beginning to emerge that enable thermodynamic measurements on small amounts of material, in short periods of time, and using readily accessible instrumentation. Here we present such a method, fast quantitative cysteine reactivity, which exploits the linkage between protein stability, sidechain protection by protein structure, and structural dynamics to characterize the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of proteins. In this approach, the reaction of a protected cysteine and thiol-reactive fluorogenic indicator is monitored over a gradient of temperatures after a short incubation time. These labeling data can be used to determine the midpoint of thermal unfolding, measure the temperature dependence of protein stability, quantify ligand-binding affinity, and, under certain conditions, estimate folding rate constants. Here, we demonstrate the fQCR method by characterizing these thermodynamic and kinetic properties for variants of Staphylococcal nuclease and E. coli ribose-binding protein engineered to contain single, protected cysteines. These straightforward, information-rich experiments are likely to find applications in protein engineering and functional genomics.

AB  - We present a palaeolimnological record in western Nubia (NW Sudan, eastern Sahara) isolated from large-scale artesian systems and thus reflecting hydrological changes resulting from local rainfall. Past changes in lake water chemistry and water depth are interpreted by combining results from biological indicators (diatoms, ostracodes and charophytes) with geochemical and stable oxygen and carbon isotope data. Palaeolake Gureinat existed from similar to 10.9 cal. ka BP until at least 7.1 cal. ka BP and is devided into five lake phases. For the first two millennia the lake was shallow and fluctuating salinity conditions prevailed (500 to 3000 mu S/cm). After similar to 8.7 cal. ka BP, the lake level rose, waters became fresh to oligosaline, and the lake had a minimum depth of at least 8 m. Both transgressive and stable lake phases were punctuated by at least three drops in lake level with complete desiccation at around 10.9 and 8.9 cal. ka BP. The third of these regressions may be coeval with the 8.2 ka climatic event. Sediments younger than 7.1 cal. ka BP representing the mid-Holocene fading of the wet phase were removed by deflation. This record shows that lakes in the eastern Sahara registered short-term climatic events, as long as they were isolated from large-scale artesian groundwater systems. Consequently, even in this continental region, early-Holocene climatic fluctuations affected water levels and salinities of hydrologically isolated lake systems.

AB  - In this study we introduce new gas exchange models that are developed under natural conditions of field grown potato. The new models could explain about 85% of the stomatal conductance variations, which was much higher than the well-known gas exchange models such as the Ball-Berry model [Ball, Woodrow, Berry, 1987. In: Nijhoff, M. (Eds.), Progress in Photosynthesis Research, vol. 4. Dordrecht, The Netherlands, pp. 5.221-5.224]. To overcome the limitations of previous models in simulating stomatal conductance when plants are exposed to drought stress, we proposed a down-regulating factor of chemical and hydraulic signalling on stomatal conductance as exp(-beta[ABA])exp(-delta|psi|) in which [ABA] and |psi| are xylem ABA concentration and absolute value of leaf or stem water potential. In this study we found that stem water potential could be a very reliable indicator of how plant water status affects the stomatal conductance regulation. While previous models considered the same weighting for relative humidity and photosynthesis rate, we found that relative humidity has a more pronounced regulating effect on stomatal conductance than photosynthesis rate and the weightings for relative humidity and photosynthesis rate, respectively, were significantly higher and lower than unity.

AB  - The climatology of small-scale patterns of mountain precipitation is poorly constrained, yet important for applications ranging from natural hazard assessment to understanding the geologic evolution of mountain ranges. Synthesizing four rainy seasons of high-resolution precipitation observations and mesoscale model output (from the Penn State/NCAR MM5), reveals a persistent small-scale pattern of precipitation over the similar to 10 km wide, similar to 800 m high ridges and valleys of the western Olympic Mountains, Washington State, USA. This pattern is characterized by a 50-70% excess accumulation over the ridge crests relative to the adjacent valleys in the annual mean. While the model shows excellent skill in simulating these patterns at seasonal time-scales, major errors exist for individual storms.
   Investigation of a range of storm events has revealed the following mechanism for the climatological pattern. Regions of enhanced condensation of cloud water are produced by ascent in stable flow over the windward slopes of major ridges. Synoptically generated precipitation grows by collection within these clouds, leading to enhanced precipitation which is advected by the prevailing winds.
   Instances of atypical patterns of precipitation suggest that under certain conditions (during periods with a low freezing level, or convective cells) fundamental changes in small-scale patterns may occur. However, case-studies and composite analysis suggest that departures from the pattern of ridge-top enhancement are rare; the basic patterns and processes appear robust to changes in temperature, winds, and background rainfall rates.

AB  - 1. Distribution and abundance patterns are influenced by cellular responses to abiotic stressors.
   2. The freshwater clam Sphaerium sp. inhabits swamp/stream systems in Uganda, in which dissolved O-2 (DO), pH and water transparency form ecotonal gradients along tributary streams. Along a swamp/stream transect, clam abundance was negatively related to DO, pH and transparency; clams were most abundant in the hypoxic/acidic swamp, less abundant in the ecotone, and absent from stream sites (neutral pH and higher DO).
   3. We tested the hypothesis that individuals living in low abundance at the distribution edge have increased stress by assessing cellular-level stress indicators in clams from four sites: dense swamp interior (reference site), swamp margin, ecotone and stream. Compared with swamp interior clams, stream clams had decreased RNA : DNA ratio (decreased protein synthesis and growth) and increased DNA and RNA oxidation (free radical damage). Of seven stress proteins related to general damage and free radical detoxification, expression of nearly all were higher in margin and ecotone clams than in swamp interior or stream clams.
   4. This pattern, which includes the first measurement of DNA and RNA oxidation in a natural population, demonstrates that stress increases along the transect, inversely to clam abundance. Additionally, this pattern is consistent with free radical stress, which suggests that inhabiting swamp conditions minimizes oxidative damage in this species.

AB  - The acoustic signals of insects are examples of sexually selected traits predominantly used by females to identify, locate and choose between potential mates. In addition to the conspicuous calling songs found in many groups, many male Orthopterans also produce a distinct courtship song when in close proximity to a female. It has been suggested that these courtship songs are indicators of male quality and may be used by females to discriminate between potential mates, but little evidence is available. We measured temporal characteristics of courtship song in the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus and three different aspects of the immune response of the same males. The relations between courtship song structure and immunity appeared to be too weak to be biologically important and hence it seems unlikely that females could use only the song parameters we measured to discriminate in favour of mates with higher immunity. However, when we compared the propensity of males to sing and the structure of their courtship songs before and after they were forced to mount an immune response, we found strong effects of our immune challenge procedure. When females were played songs manipulated to sound like those produced by males with high or low encapsulation abilities (a measure of immunity), they responded more rapidly to the songs corresponding to a high immune response.

AB  - Clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene from the Perinthatta anorthositic gabbro in southwestern India exhibit exsolution intergrowths of pyroxenes (occurring in five stages involving pigeonite, orthopyroxene and/or augite) and Fe-Ti oxides. The thicker irregular pyroxene lamellae appear to be the result of heterogeneous nucleation, indicating that this was the first unmixing process to begin. This was followed by homogeneous nucleation of regularly spaced, quite uniform pyroxene lamellae and defect-free fine pyroxene platelets between early-formed exsolution lamellae, suggesting progressive or continual nature of exsolution during slow cooling. Pyroxene thermometric calculations indicate that subcalcic augite and pigeonite equilibrated at similar to 935 degrees C, with the different lamellar generations formed between similar to 914 and similar to 748 degrees C. Pre-metamorphic anorthositic gabbro crystallization is considered to have taken place at deep crustal levels (similar to 30 km; similar to 9-10 kbar) and later emplacement at shallower crustal levels (similar to 15 km; similar to 5-6 kbar) suggesting polybaric conditions. The apparent difference between the pressure of crystallization and the emplacement of the Perinthatta anorthositic gabbro supports the common Proterozoic anorthosite petrogenetic model, involving initial crystallization at depth, followed by intrusion as a crystal-rich mush. Following emplacement, the igneous assemblage was affected by granulite facies metamorphism on cooling, as indicated by smaller granulite minerals along grain boundaries and the partial re-equilibration of exsolved phases.

AB  - The relative abundances of Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) and total arboreal pollen in pollen spectra from the Lake Baikal region and calculation of a steppe-forest vegetation index place constraints on the past climatic conditions related to permafrost, summer temperatures, precipitation and soil moisture availability. Here we review the data on Picea pollen in sub-recent spectra, the present-day distribution of Picea obovata, and sedimentary records from a number of sites to arrive at a coherent picture of evolution of regional vegetation since the late glacial. The expansion of Siberian spruce along with steppe vegetation dates back to the undivided Bolling-Allerod interval, when this species became dominant in arboreal vegetation. Steppe landscapes persisted in a large part of the Lake Baikal watershed prior to 9.2-9 ka when the expansion of arboreal vegetation took place. Following the Younger Dryas (which seems to have had little effect on regional vegetation and peat accumulation), the role of Siberian spruce steadily declined until 8.6-6.8 ka. In the late Holocene, the abundance of P. obovata rarely exceeded the present-day ratio of ca 2% total arboreal pollen. Departures towards higher Picea abundance and higher steppe-forest index at ca 6-5 and 3-2.5 ka in Selenga Delta area appear to reflect periods with decreased temperatures and higher moisture availability in the southern part of the Lake Baikal watershed.

AB  - Many birds display carotenoid-based ornaments, which are typically considered to be honest indicators of individual health and condition. Experimental work on male red-shouldered widowbirds, Euplectes axillaris, has demonstrated a function of the carotenoid-based epaulettes in male contests and territory acquisition. Using two experiments, we investigated whether the natural variation in this colour signal reveals male competitive ability. Males with larger and redder (more longwave) epaulettes established territories to the exclusion of males with smaller and less red signals, which formed a large population of 'floaters'. In an experiment in which we removed 42 resident males, these floaters rapidly filled up vacant territories. Among removed birds held in captivity, residents strongly dominated floaters in dyadic contests over access to an easily monopolized feeder (i.e. outside the context of territory defence). Only epaulette size predicted the outcome of these male contests. In addition, when competitors were experimentally given similar epaulette signals (removed or painted red to the average population size), the males were involved in more aggressive interactions than during unmanipulated contests, but residents continued to outcompete floaters. On release (after 8 days) to the breeding grounds, most residents (88%) rapidly reclaimed their territories from replacements. Combined, these results suggest that some intrinsic 'resource-holding potential', associated with the variation in epaulette signal, is primarily responsible for residents dominating nonresidents.

AB  - We developed a quantitative chironomid-July air temperature inference model based on surface sediments from 81 Swiss lakes and applied it to the Holocene subfossil chironomid record of Hinterburgsee, a small subalpine lake in the northern Swiss Alps (present-day mean July air temperature of 11.3degreesC). After smoothing to reduce the high between-sample variability of inferred temperatures, the reconstruction indicates July air temperatures of 10.4-10.9degreesC at the end of the Younger Dryas, of 11.9-12.8degreesC during the early and mid-Holocene (11500-4000 cal. BP), and slightly lower temperatures of 11.5-12.0degreesC during the late Holocene (3500-1000 cal. BP). A warming trend inferred for the past millennium is most likely an artifact of human impact on Hinterburgsee's chironomid fauna, rather than a genuine temperature signal. The most prominent climatological events during the Holocene were two periods of lower temperatures at c. 10700-10500 cal. BP and 8200-7700 cal. BP and an abrupt shift to a cooler late-Holocene climate around 4000-3700 cal. BP. Although the chironomid-inferred climate signals were within the prediction error of the model (1.51degreesC), major inferred temperature changes agree well with other northern and central European climate reconstructions and underline the potential of subfossil chironomid analysis to reconstruct even the moderate climatic changes within the Holocene.

AB  - We report a convenient method of extracting and detecting sterols in environmental water samples. Particle-associated sterols were extracted onto glass-fibre filters then the filters were supercritical fluid extracted (at 33 MPa, 80 degrees C for 30 min) followed by pentafluorophenyldimethylsilyl (flophemesyl) derivatization for gas chromatographic-electron-capture detection (GC-ECD). Optimal derivatization of epicoprostanol, coprostanol, cholesterol, dihydrocholesterol, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol and stigmastanol with neat flophemesyl chloride was achieved under mild conditions (i.e., room temperature, 15 min) without the need for added solvent. These sterols gave linear GC-ECD calibrations (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.99) while detection limits in the final solutions were 0.1-0.6 mu g/ml. Overall recoveries for the supercritical extraction and derivatization steps were 80-110% (mean 92%). The procedure was applied to raw sewage and to river water samples and 0-55%-higher results were obtained over those achieved by modified Bligh and Dyer extraction. Flophemesyl derivatization of sterols allows selective ECD, improved separation from other compounds such as polychlorinatedbiphenyls that may be found in environmental samples, and reduced clean-up requirements (e.g.. removing lipids by saponification which may be needed when flame ionization detection is used). Characteristic mass spectra if the flophemesyl derivatives are reported; these were obtained in order to distinguish between sterol classes and individual sterols. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Temperatures of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) nests on the beaches of northern Cyprus and Turkey were examined. Electronic continuous-temperature recorders programmed by computer were placed at the top, middle, and bottom of the nests. The sex of 3-7 hatchlings from each level was determined from gonadal histology. The maximum temperature increase during the incubation period was 9.6 degrees C for both species. The mean temperature during the middle third of the incubation period is a good indicator of the sex ratio of the clutch. The percentage of female embryos increased with temperature, 50% being female at 29 degrees C. The mean temperature over the entire incubation period is not a good indicator of sex ratio but can be used to predict the duration of incubation period. The temperature differences within the clutch were larger in loggerhead than in green turtle nests. Eggs at the top of the nest experienced generally warmer (up to 1.4 degrees C) conditions than eggs at the bottom of the same nest, and this caused variation in sex ratio within nests. Over all nests, the sex ratio (percent female) of hatchlings was 91% at the top, 83% at the middle, and 69% at the bottom. There was considerable interbeach thermal variation. Marked diel cycles of up to 1.5 degrees C were detected in loggerhead turtle nests but not in the deeper nests of green turtles.

AB  - Objective: Previous research has shown biological, phenomenological, and cognitive similarities between schizophrenic patients and individuals with schizophrenia-related personality disorders and features. Evidence further suggests that of these common dysfunctions, abnormal attention is one of the most promising indicators of a biological susceptibility to schizophrenia-related disorders. Although attentional dysfunctions have been reliably defected in schizophrenic patients as well as in a variety of populations at risk for schizophrenia, few studies have investigated attention in clinical patients with schizotypal personality disorder. In this study the extent of attentional impairment was assessed in subjects with schizotypal personality disorder, normal comparison subjects, patients with other personality disorders, and schizophrenic patients. Method: Thirty subjects with schizotypal personality disorder, 35 subjects with other personality disorders (i.e., clinic patients with non-odd cluster personality disorders), 36 subjects with schizophrenia, and 20 comparison subjects who did not meet criteria for any axis I or axis II disorder participated in this study. All subjects were diagnosed according to DSM-III criteria. Attention was assessed by using the Continuous Performance Test, Identical Pairs Version. Results: Analyses indicated that subjects with schizotypal personality, disorder, like schizophrenic subjects, performed significantly worse than comparison subjects on both the verbal and spatial tasks of the Continuous Performance Test, Identical Pairs Version. In contrast, patients with other personality disorders performed similarly to comparison subjects across conditions. Conclusions: These results suggest that patients with schizotypal personality disorder are impaired in their attentional functioning relative to normal comparison subjects and that they display deficits that are similar to the pattern characterizing schizophrenic patients.

AB  - Colony growth form in some Silurian heliolitid corals is analyzed by the measurement of their shape in profile.  Data are presented for seven species, Stelliporella parvistella, Heliolites interstinctus, H. megastoma, H. daintreei, H. spongodes, Propora tubulata, and Plasmopora scita from three localities in Gotland, Sweden, and three localities in England.  Intraspecific growth-form variation is presented on triangle diagrams.  These plots allow variation to be compared between species present at each locality and between localities for each species.  Results indicate that the overall potential for growth-form variation is genetically controlled and that levels of response to environmental stimuli may differ markedly between species.  Stelliporella parvistella is a very plastic species, the only one developing branching growth in addition to other growth forms.  Heliolites interstinctus is much less variable, dominantly tabular, domal, and low bulbous in form, but demonstrates a similar response.  Propora tubulata has a tightly constrained bulbous growth form that shows little variation between localities.  The other species are represented by few specimens, most of which parallel H. interstinctus.  The likely moderating influences of light levels, substrate type, sedimentation rate, energy levels, and other variables on growth-form variation and species range are considered.  The main environmental factor including ecophenotypic response is concluded to be sedimentation rate.  A close correlation between this factor and growth form in S. parvistella indicates that form in this species is a particularly sensitive indicator of sedimentation rate and substrate conditions.  No simple equations can be made between specific environments and one particular growth form in these corals.

AB  - Land fragmentation has a negative impact on agricultural production and human life and is an important indicator to measure pasture ecology. This study aims to reveal the relationship between the fragmentation of pasture and pasture ecology in typical pastoral areas of China. Introducing the concept of grass-livestock balance (GLB) is to estimate the ecological protection status of the pasture, and the revised pasture stock carrying capacity index is used to measure whether the GLB is maintained in the pasture. Meanwhile, the study reveals how to avoid the negative effects of pasture fragmentation through different grazing patterns. The results are as follows: (1) Pasture fragmentation is one of the important factors that prevent herder families from achieving GLB. (2) Rest grazing and rotational grazing can avoid the poor conditions caused by the fragmentation of pasture and achieve the GLB. Furthermore, rotational grazing can better alleviate the income pressure of herders than resting grazing. (3) Community-based nomadism has no significant effect on the GLB. That is possibly because communities integrate scattered land plots, but pasture roads, water and other public resources are poorly managed, and the "free-rider phenomenon" is common. Therefore, we argue that the pasture fragmentation problem should be solved using rest grazing and rotational grazing in different areas. Besides, more public service facilities should be built in the pastoral areas, and the government should strengthen their supervision to promote ecological restoration in pasture and increase herdsmen's income.

AB  - This paper presents a novel set of water quality indexes to identify the area potentially affected by point sources of bacterial pollution in coastal bathing waters. The indexes, developed in the framework of the CADEAU service, are evaluated on the results of a modelling system based on the integration of a high-resolution ocean model, remote sensing observations and in situ monitoring data for the northern Adriatic Sea. In particular, the system is a downscaling of the Mediterranean Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service and exploits data produced within the Bathing Waters Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive to create added value products. The aim of the proposed indexes is to support the identification of areas of influence for bathing waters by identifying the potential threat from point sources of bacterial pollution, both in standard conditions and peculiar events such as a total bypass of wastewater treatment plants. The results for the Chioggia Municipality case study show the potential of the indexes to significantly improve the geographical identification and quantitative evaluation of the impacts of bacterial pollution sources on bathing waters, facilitating the design of mitigation measures. The proposed methodology represents a new management approach to support local authorities in defining the area of influence within the water bathing profile through the proper characterization of the point sources of bacterial pollution.

AB  - The concentration of L-cysteine (Cys), a sulfur-containing amino acid, acts as an indicator and biomarker for various diseases in humans. Therefore, the identification and detection of abnormal concentrations of Cys are critically important for determining human health. In this study, excitation-dependent multiple emission nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon dots (NS-CDs) are synthesized using a one-pot hydrothermal method. The prepared NS-CDs exhibit a small particle size, good optical properties with high quantum yield, excellent stability, and excitation-dependent photoluminescence (PL) property. The synthesized NS-CDs display a narrow diameter ranging from 3 to 7 nm with a relatively higher quantum yield (QY) up to 11.4%. Under optimal conditions, these NS-CDs show good selectivity for Cys over other biologically relevant species and even other similar (di)thiols (GSH/DTT). The synthesized NS-CDs show excellent selectivity and sensitivity to Cys, with a low detection limit of 23 nM and a linear detection range from 0 to 10 mu M. The NS-CDs and NS-CDs/Cys are used for cell imaging, showing low toxicity to HCT116 cells and exhibits green fluorescence when observed by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the controllable and strong photoluminescent emission properties of the NSCDs and NS-CDs/Cys are visualized as green photoluminescent ink under UV light illumination. The present study is an attractive and innovative perception into the biomedical applications of NS-CDs with controllable photoluminescence.

AB  - Tropical ecosystems are under increasing pressure from changes in land use (Ch-LUs). These changes significantly alter the quality/health of the soil, thus minimizing the possibilities for further development and human well-being. This occurs in the buffer zone of the Podocarpus National Park (PNP), where the majority of the population has recently been affected by food insecurity. As a means of subsistence, peasant producers have implemented changes in land use to produce food that will improve their living conditions. In this context, the objectives of the study were: (i) to evaluate the effect of Ch-LUs on the main edaphic physical-chemical properties in a buffer zone of the Podocarpus National Park in Ecuador (PNP) and, (ii) to compare whether there is concordance between scientific knowledge and local knowledge with regards to soil fertility management indicators and practices. Soils were analyzed in the laboratory (bulk density (g cm(-3)), texture, pH, and total carbon (%) and then compared with local knowledge through semi-structured interviews administered to farmers. The results revealed greater similarity between the uses of crops and pastures, compared to the use of forest, due to a greater alteration in the cultivated and pasture areas, presenting as changes within the soil quality indicators. By integrating the knowledge of the farmer with the scientist, it was shown that they do indeed identify with local indicators of soil quality visible in the field.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms, which are a danger to the lives of humans and animals, are caused by a sudden increase in the concentration of cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes. Cyanobacteria concentrations can be reliably measured using chemical and biological indicators, but the measurement process of the indicators is either laborintensive or very costly. These limitations do not allow the general public to measure concentrations, so local health organizations or departments regularly assume the responsibility of measuring water quality. While computational models exist to predict algal concentrations, the accuracy of these models and need for customization due to varied lake conditions make them generally not yet reliable. We find that common regression-error functions cannot sufficiently evaluate the performance of cyanobacteria prediction models because the occurrence of harmful algal blooms is rare. Therefore, we present a method of forecasting cyanobacteria concentrations in freshwater lakes based on a machine-learning model trained on a dataset from Lake Utah with automatically-measured indicators from lake buoys. We compare several models and find that a support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel for regression reliably forecasts harmful algal blooms using comparatively few and easy-to-obtain input parameters. The special feature of the model is that it exclusively uses variables that can be measured by the general public without great effort and costs, and the amount of data necessary to train such a model is relatively minimal, allowing different models to be trained to accommodate for the nuances of different lakes.

AB  - The n-alkyl leaf waxes of the temperate forest of South America are poorly studied, despite being a biogeographically isolated forest spanning wide environmental conditions. To evaluate whether local species adaptation and environmental changes influence the n-alkyl leaf wax composition, we measured the molecular abundance and distribution of n-alkyl leaf waxes (n-alkanoic acids, n-alkanes and n-alkanols) of three dominant native species from southern temperate forest in South America. We surveyed Araucaria araucana (n = 9), Nothofagus dombeyi (n = 17) and Chusquea sp. (n = 21) at different elevations. The relationship of n-alkyl leaf wax abundance and distribution with elevation is not significant in any species, except for n-alkane ACL (average chain length) in Chusquea sp. Significant correlations are found for n-alkanoic acid abundance with precipitation and aridity in Chusquea sp. and n-alkane abundance and ACL with temperature in A. araucana. These data suggest a species-specific response to environmental variables. The main similarity in the three species is a higher abundance of n-alkanoic acids (>60%) relative to other n-alkyl leaf waxes. Only n-alkanols are not correlated to any environmental variable, and neither ACL nor C-max overlap among species. These results suggest n-alkanols as a potential chemotaxonomic indicator at a lower taxonomic level in the region. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To date, COVID-19 has claimed more than 100 000 American lives. Early inquiry suggests preexisting conditions are key risk factors contributing to COVID-19 mortality and air pollution exposure could exacerbate this relationship. Building on prior research linking deaths from respiratory viruses to air pollution exposures, we investigate how 2014 National Air Toxics Assessment hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) respiratory hazard quotient and respiratory hazard index are related to COVID-19 mortality. Our focus on HAPs builds upon the knowledge base linking poor air quality to COVID-19 mortality, since most (if not all) earlier studies only include criteria pollutants. Herein, we examine the relationship between HAP exposure and US-based COVID-19 mortality, while controlling for socioeconomic status, population health indicators, and exposure to PM2.5 and ozone. We fit county-level negative binomial mixed models, predicting COVID-19 mortality as a function of HAP respiratory toxicity levels and relevant covariates. We include models for combined exposure to HAPs, as well as for specific pollutants. We find that an increase in the respiratory hazard index is associated with a 9% increase in COVID-19 mortality. Although differing in magnitude, this association holds for individual HAPs acetaldehyde, and diesel PM. These findings help us to understand variation in US-based COVID-19 mortality rates, reinforce existing research linking air pollution to mortality, and emphasize the importance of regulatory efforts to limit air pollution exposure risk.

AB  - Biogenic amines (BA) are markers of food freshness and indicators of inadequate food processing and storage conditions. Because BA determination is important for food quality evaluation, and considering the relatively complex analytical procedures available, new approaches are required for their determination. In this work, an environmentally friendly analytical procedure is proposed for BA determination in cheese, involving separation by sequential injection chromatography without organic solvents or chemical derivatization of the analytes. Sample preparation step was carried out by acid protein precipitation and low-temperature partition with a reduced volume of organic solvent (500 mu L of acetonitrile). Because of the previously mentioned characteristics, an analytical eco-scale = 91 was achieved. Histamine, tyramine, and tryptamine were separated in a cyanopropyl monolithic column in the isocratic elution mode, with 3.0 mmol L-1 phosphoric acid aqueous solution as mobile phase. The analytes were quantified from their intrinsic absorption at 210 nm. The analysis time was less than 3 min, with good chromatographic efficiency (N >= 75000 plates m(-1)). For the three analytes, LOD within 0.05-0.10 mg kg(-1), LOQ within 0.14-0.30 mg kg(-1), and linear response ranges up to 10 mg kg(-1) (histamine and tyramine) and 15 mg kg(-1) (tryptamine) were achieved with good precision (CV = 3.0%, n = 12). The proposed procedure was successfully applied to the determination of tyramine in cheese samples, with recoveries in the 81-128% range.

AB  - The control of soil seed bank (SSB) dynamics is crucial to the ecologies of plant populations of many species, but has been little studied in tropical environments. The objectives of this work were to characterize the SSB of Acrocomia aculeata, an important neotropical oleaginous palm, and to define the influence of edaphic and climatic factors on its dynamics. Exposed and buried diaspores were collected in five areas of the Cerrado biome in central Brazil. Evaluations of the diaspores, young plants, and in vitro embryo cultures defined 26 indicators of SSB dynamics that were correlated with 19 physical-chemical attributes of the soil. Seedlings emergence was studied under greenhouse conditions during five years and the thermal control of germination was evaluated experimentally. A. aculeata forms persistent SSBs, with P being the main edaphic factor associated with seed input. High levels of Al and clay (associated with insect predation), organic matter (fungal contamination), and sand (bacterial contamination) contributed to negative outputs (embryo death). The maintenance of intact SSB embryos, however, is independent of edaphic factors. Wide thermal amplitudes in the winter associated with high temperatures in the spring promote overcoming dormancy and favor positive SSB outputs as well as the synchronization of seedling emergence at the beginning of rainy season. The high productivity of A. aculeata and its ability to maintain viable but dormant embryos in the soil contribute to controlling SSB dynamics, reproductive success, and its wide distribution.

AB  - Introduction: Noise is an environmental stressor and can cause or exacerbate mental disorders, and affect the individual performance in certain conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the combined effects of noise and smoking on the cognitive performance of the workers in the automotive industry.
   Methods: This research is a descriptive-analytical study with a cross-sectional design conducted on 300 workers randomly assigned into two groups of noise-exposed and nonexposed. They were examined using computerized tests, including the Tower of London test (TOL), Continuous Performance test (CFI), and Stroop test. The sound pressure levels were measured based on an 8-hour equal-loudness contour in each group according to ISO 9612 standard, using the Testo CEL-815 sound level meter.
   Results: The study of combined effects of noise and smoking on 12 CPT indicators using the 2-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicate that noise and smoking factors had a significant impact on the mean number of errors and correct responses in the third 50-sfimuli stage, the mean number of errors and correct responses in the second 50-stimuli stage with P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.012 and P<0.001 for smoking respectively, but only noise affected the other 7 indicators (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Smoking and noise have negative impacts on concentration, attention, and cognitive processing speed, which can lead to an individual's mistakes and delayed decision making at the workplace.

AB  - A recirculating aquaculture system with farmed tilapia is the most popular combination in aquaponics, an integration of aquaculture and hydroponics. Despite nutrient-rich fish-rearing water being regarded as a valuable resource for aquaponics, the quality and value of inhabitant microorganisms are certainly understudied. Our present research illustrates the feasibility of the tilapia-rearing water as a valuable source of beneficial microorganisms called plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). Microbial communities were examined with a combination of culture-independent high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and cultivation methods. Microbial communities determined using high-throughput sequencing indicated the usefulness of Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria as beneficial microbial indicators to assess the health condition of recirculating aquaculture systems. Siderophore production, ammonia production and phosphate solubilization assays were used for screening and 41% of isolates were identified as plant growth promoting bacteria. These bacteria were classified as Actinobacteria (eight strains [32% in total], Dietzia, Gordonia, Microbacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus), Bacilli (six strains [24%], Bacillus and Paenibacillus), Flavobacteriia (one strain [4%], Myroides), Betaproteobacteria (two strains [8%], Acidovorax and Chromobacterium) and Gammaproteobacteria (eight strains [32%], Aeromonas, Plesiomonas and Pseudomonas). We found that the tilapia-rearing water naturally contained various lineages of PGPB and could be esteemed as a worthy seed bank of PGPB. Because aquaponics is a difficult system to use pesticides and herbicides, the role of PGPB to prevent plant pathogens and maintain healthy root system may be more important than traditional agricultural settings.

AB  - The Welfare Quality (R) (WQ) protocols have been developed as a tool for the assessment of farm animal welfare based on scientific evidence. Animal welfare (AW) is part of the sustainability criteria of livestock production. A study was carried out in four states of Central Mexico in seven rustic (rPS) and six technified (tPS) production systems using the WQ protocol with the objective of providing an initial approximation of the welfare of animals and to discuss the validity of indicators of AW. The results showed that the animals housed in rustic units presented better results in the Good Health category and with respect to the criterion expression of social behaviour, while the frequency of criteria concerning Positive emotional states was higher in animals in the technified units. In the changing context in which the farms operate, including changing agricultural policies, new environmental and food safety regulations, variability of climatic conditions, and volatility in prices of inputs and outputs, it is not only the attributes referring to productivity and efficiency that become relevant. It is concluded that the criteria related to the WQ principles of health and behaviour are sensitive to changes in the housing and management of pigs. The high occurrences of health and behaviour problems recorded in technified systems are an indicator of poor welfare.

AB  - Drought indicators are proliferating, but with little consideration of which are most meaningful for describing drought impacts. A number of recent reviews compare different drought indicators, but none assess which indicators are actually used in the many operational drought monitoring and early warning efforts, why they were selected, or whether they have been 'ground-truthed,' i.e., compared with information representing local drought conditions and/or impacts. Also lacking is a comprehensive assessment of the state of monitoring drought impacts. To help fill this gap, we combine a review of drought indicators and impacts with a survey of 33 providers of operational drought monitoring and early warning systems from global to regional scales. Despite considerable variety in the indicators used operationally, certain patterns emerge. Both the literature review and the survey reveal that impact monitoring does exist but has rarely been systematized. Efforts to test drought indicators have mostly focused on agricultural drought. Our review points to a current trend towards the design and use of composite indicators, but with limited evaluation of the links between indicators and drought impacts. Overall, we find that much progress has been made both in research and practice on drought indicators, but monitoring and early warning systems are not yet strongly linked with the assessment of wider impacts on the environment and society. To understand drought impacts fully requires a better framing of drought as a coupled dynamic between the environment and society. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a scientific and practical tool to be used to assess horse welfare after commercial transport over long journeys. A set of physical, behavioural and environmental measures was selected, covering welfare aspects of both transport and unloading procedures. The protocol was field-tested on 51 intra-EU commercial transports arriving at different sites in Italy. Univariate analysis was implemented to look for associations between the input variables (environmental hazards potentially affecting the animal well-being during long transports) and the outcome variables (direct evaluation of the animal condition). No severe welfare impairments were recorded (ie dead on arrival, severe injuries, non-ambulatory animals), while milder ones were more frequent at unloading (eg slipping; 36.7%, reluctance to move; 9.6%). Correlations emerged between ramp slope and falling; type of ramp floor and slipping; fast gait and the presence of gaps between the ramp and the floor. The horses' behaviour was also related to the type of handling procedure used. The measures were repeatable and practical to apply and score during real-time unloading. This work provides a sound basis for a new and practical welfare assessment tool for horses travelling over long journeys. Careful and constant application of this protocol would provide stakeholders with the opportunity to track and monitor changes in the industry over time, as well as to identify high risk areas in transport routines.

AB  - Connectivity between the terrestrial and marine environment in the Artic is changing as a result of climate change, influencing both freshwater budgets, and the supply of carbon to the sea. This study characterizes the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) within the Lena Delta region and evaluates the behavior of DOM across the fresh water-marine gradient. Six fluorescent components (four humic-like; one marine humic-like; one protein-like) were identified by Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) with a clear dominance of allochthonous humic-like signals. Colored DOM (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were highly correlated and had their distribution coupled with hydrographical conditions. Higher DOM concentration and degree of humification were associated with the low salinity waters of the Lena River. Values decreased toward the higher salinity Laptev Sea shelf waters. Results demonstrate different responses of DOM mixing in relation to the vertical structure of the water column, as reflecting the hydrographical dynamics in the region. Two mixing curves for DOM were apparent. In surface waters above the pycnocline there was a sharper decrease in DOM concentration in relation to salinity indicating removal. In the bottom water layer the DOM decrease within salinity was less. We propose there is a removal of DOM occurring primarily at the surface layer, which is likely driven by photodegradation and flocculation.

AB  - Adsorption of three selected pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (ketoprofen (KEP), carbamazepine (CBZ), and bisphenol A (BPA)) by two reduced graphene oxides (rGOI and rGO2) and one commercial graphene was examined under different solution conditions. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and powdered graphite were also investigated for comparison. All adsorption isotherms followed the order of SWCNTs > rGO1 > rGO2 > MWCNTs > graphene > graphite, consistent with the orders of their surface areas and micropore volumes. After surface area normalization, adsorption affinities of the three PPCPs onto graphenes were lower than onto graphite, suggesting incomplete occupation for adsorption sites because of the aggregation of graphene sheets and the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups. The observed pH effects on adsorption correlated well with the pH-regulated distribution of the protonated neutral species of the three PPCPs. Increasing ionic strength from 0 to 20 mM increased KEP adsorption due to the electrostatic screening by Na+ and Ca2+. Both humic acid (HA) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) suppressed PPCPs adsorption to all adsorbents, but their impacts onto graphenes were lower than those onto CNTs because of their lower adsorption by graphenes. More severe HA (or SDBS) effect was found on negatively charged KEP at the tested solution pH 6.50 due to the electrostatic repulsion between the same charged KEP and HA (or SDBS). The findings of the present study may have significant implications for the environmental fate assessment of PPCPs and graphene.

AB  - A method is proposed to analyze the environmental and economic sustainability of biorefineries producing lignocellulosic ethanol. The bidimensional method builds on the conceptual design of the production facility (mathematical models of mass and energy balances of each process stage, equipment sizing, and capital costing models) thus enabling the analysis of prospective technologies. The conceptual design articulates the relations among process stages as impact generators (IIG), stakeholders (and their concerns) as impact receivers (EIR), and indicators to measure the environmental and economic impacts of the process facility. Indicators are formulated as functions of process variables and parameters. Overall impacts for each domain are calculated by weighting the indicators using appropriate dimensional functions and scaling factors. Using the proposed method, the conceptual design of a standard biochemical biorefinery provides the basis for building a sustainability framework comprising 15 indicators. While some of the obtained indicators are ubiquitous in the literature, other less common yet important are identified. A case study illustrates the use of the sustainability framework. A single-product biorefinery is compared against a multi-product scheme, showing that single-product schemes may prove, under certain conditions, more sustainable than their multi-product counterparts. The sustainability framework provides the rationale to clearly identify the causality from IIG to metric values. This information may be used to support the decisions regarding possible improvements of IIG or modifications of weighting parameters in the dimensional functions in order improve the sustainability of the processes under consideration.

AB  - In 2008, clinical observations in our colony of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) suggested a high frequency of type 2 diabetes. Postmortem studies of diabetic animals revealed dense amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets. To investigate these findings, we screened our colony (97 male mangabeys; 99 female mangabeys) for the disease from 2008 to 2012. The overall prevalence of diabetes was 11% and of prediabetes was 7%, which is nearly double that reported for other primate species (less than 6%). Fructosamine and triglyceride levels were the best indicators of diabetes; total cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin were not associated with disease. Increasing age was a significant risk factor: prevalence increased from 0% in infants, juveniles, and young adults to 11% in adults and 19% in geriatric mangabeys. Sex, medroxyprogesterone acetate exposure, and SIV status were unrelated to disease. Weight was marginally higher in prediabetics, but body condition did not indicate obesity. Of the 49 mangabeys that were necropsied after clinical euthanasia or death from natural causes, 22 were diabetic; all 22 animals demonstrated pancreatic amyloid, and most had more than 75% of islets replaced with amyloid. We conclude that type 2 diabetes is more common in mangabeys than in other primate species. Diabetes in mangabeys has some unusual pathologic characteristics, including the absence of altered cholesterol levels and glycated hemoglobin but a robust association of pancreatic insular amyloidosis with clinical diabetes. Future research will examine the genetic basis of mangabey diabetes and evaluate additional diagnostic tools using imaging and serum markers.

AB  - The removal of condensable hydrocarbons or tars from raw gas derived from biomass gasification presents an obstacle in the widespread application of biomass gasification. Hot catalytic tar cleaning as a secondary tar removal strategy is discussed as a tar cleaning technology. This can be realized in a dual-fluidized-bed reactor system, in which a catalytically active bed material is continuously regenerated. Such a process is termed chemical looping reforming (CLR). In such a process, it has been suggested that oxygen carrier particles employed for chemical looping combustion may be used, with the oxygen transfer from the particles to the gas promoting tar decomposition. Experiments were conducted in a small-scale, batch-wise fluidized-bed reactor with the aim of investigating a variety of bed materials for this process. The purpose of the present work is thus to conduct a screening study of a variety of bed materials based on the transition metals Fe, Mn, Ni, and Cu. The experiments were conducted in a batch fluidized bed, where the particles are exposed to reformer and regenerator conditions alternatingly. The conversion of ethylene from a synthetic gasification gas mixture was used as an indicator for the suitability of the materials for tar conversion. It was found that the natural material bauxite and the synthetic bed materials NiO/alpha-Al2O3, CuO/MgAl2O4, and La0.8Sr0.2FeO3/gamma-Al2O3 exhibit high ethylene conversion rates and, thus, possess promising properties for their application in CLR

AB  - Acid sulphate soils (ASS) are widely spread worldwide and are detrimental to the environment. South Yunderup is one of the coastal areas of Western Australia heavily affected by ASS. Conventional investigation is costly and time-consuming, and thus there is an urgent need to rapidly characterize and identify this type of soil. This paper aims to characterize these soils using reflectance spectra, which may be one of the most significant steps in effectively identifying them and mapping their extent by remote sensing. The ASS from the study area were divided into several groups and subtypes according to both pH measurements and mineral composition as identified by X-ray diffraction analysis. Each group and subtype was then characterized by its spectral reflectance features. We found that the spectral characteristics of ASS are governed by the spectral features of its compositional minerals. In particular, some secondary iron-bearing minerals produced by the formation of ASS, together with surrounding minerals such as carbonate, play vitally important roles in influencing the spectral characterization of ASS. These iron-bearing minerals, including iron oxides, hydroxides/oxyhydroxides (e.g. haematite, goethite, and ferrihydrite), and iron sulphates (e.g. jarosite and copiapite), have diagnostic spectral features and are therefore detectable in the reflectance range. Moreover, these secondary iron-bearing minerals could be indicators suggesting the pH conditions in which they formed. The results of this study include the overall mineral distribution of the study area, the spectral characterization of different groups and subtypes of ASS, and the linkages between spectral features and pH ranges.

AB  - Petrographic and geochemical data collected from the Pab Formation, a late Cretaceous clastic sequence exposed in the Kirthar Range of western Pakistan, yield important clues about the influence of the varied source regimes, transportation routes and volcanic input that have influenced the composition of sediments comprising this formation. Detrital compositional modes, petrotectonic discrimination diagrams and paleocurrent data all demonstrate that the Pab sands were ultimately derived from granitic-gneissic terranes forming the Indian Craton, exposed to the E and SE of the study area, with probable supplementary contribution from the mature, ancient sedimentary cover of the craton. These data also confirm that the two contemporaneous depositional systems operating during accumulation of the Pab Formation in this area were supplied from somewhat different sources and through different routes. Sediments deposited in the Central Kirthar sub-basin were derived from the East, while coeval deposits within the Southern Kirthar sub-basin were supplied from SSE and include relatively fresh volcanic detritus that is interpreted as the product of the major Deccan Trap volcanic episode, initiated during late Maastrichtian times. Moreover, geochemical indicators demonstrate that the ultimate composition of Pab sediments has been strongly influenced by intense chemical weathering, associated with warm/humid climatic conditions in the source areas, accompanied by significant diagenetic effects.

AB  - An experimental site was set up in northeast France on a Luvisol (ruptic) soil to examine the duration of physical, chemical and biological disturbances in the soil following mechanized forest harvesting. Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux (SE) and concentration ([CO2]) in the silt loam layer (050 cm) were measured from March 2008 to March 2010 in the trafficked (T) and control (C) plots of this site. This study aimed to validate these two measurements as indicators for long-term soil monitoring following disturbance by heavy traffic in 2007. Throughout the sampling period, SE in the T-treatment was significantly reduced relative to that in the C-treatment. The response of [CO2] to traffic depended on the season; it decreased during summer and increased during winter and spring. The combination of the two measurements indicated an increase in the frequency and duration of anoxic conditions resulting from poor gas diffusion after heavy forest traffic. The relationships between soil climatic properties (temperature, water content and water table level) on one hand and SE or [CO2] on the other, demonstrated a strong control of SE by soil biological activity and a double control of [CO2] by gas production/consumption and gas transfer. Our findings suggest that [CO2] and SE are sensitive to soil degradation by forest harvesting and that the impact of soil compaction provides complementary information on the processes involved in regulating CO2 production and efflux. However, their use as simple indicators is questionable as the impact varied with time and was probably dependent on the soil type.

AB  - The sediments in the Calcasieu Estuary are contaminated with a wide variety of chemicals of potential concern (COPCs), including heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalates, chlorinated benzenes, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. The sources of these COPCs include both point and non-point source discharges. As part of a baseline ecological risk assessment, the risks to benthic invertebrates posed by exposure to sediment-associated COPCs were assessed using five lines of evidence, including whole-sediment chemistry, pore-water chemistry, whole-sediment toxicity, pore-water toxicity, and benthic invertebrate community structure. The results of this assessment indicated that exposure to whole sediments and/or pore water from the Calcasieu Estuary generally posed low risks to benthic invertebrate communities (i.e., risks were classified as low for 68% of the sampling locations investigated). However, incremental risks to benthic invertebrates (i.e., compared with those associated with exposure to conditions in reference areas) were indicated for 32% of the sampling locations within the estuary. Of the three areas of concern (AOCs) investigated, the risks to benthic invertebrates were highest in the Bayou d'Inde AOC; risks were generally lower in the Upper Calcasieu River AOC and Middle Calcasieu River AOC. The areas showing the highest risks to sediment-dwelling organisms were generally located in the vicinity of point source discharges of COPCs. These results provided risk managers with the information required to make decisions regarding the need for remedial actions at the site.

AB  - Taxonomy of the class Synurophyceae is based on the morphology of the siliceous cell coat, especially of the scales that are found in samples of freshwater plankton or in sediments and examined by electron microscope (EM). Members of this class are known to be powerful indicators of environmental conditions and are often used for biomonitoring and paleoecological studies. We investigated the effect of temperature on scale shape using landmark-based geometric morphometric methods in two synurophycean species Mallomonas kalinae Rezacova and Synura curtispina (Petersen & Hansen) Asmund. Clones of these species were grown at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) in batch culture experiments. We found statistically significant differences in the shape and size variation of silicate structures corresponding to temperature changes, although a substantial part of shape variation was associated with the position of scales on the cell. The range of shape variation was characterised by wide rounded vs. tapered scales, and further by the extent of the dome area, and the secondary layer. Highly asymmetrical apical Mallomonas scales occurred only at low temperatures (10 and 15 degrees C). We also revealed a tendency for scale size to be reduced with increasing temperature; significant differences were found both in size of scales and in length of bristles or spines. Additionally, the present study provides evidence that geometric morphometrics is a powerful tool in analyses of temperature induced shape variation of silica scales.

AB  - This article reviews the various available methodologies to estimate submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and demonstrates the utility of radon with a case study. An attempt has been made to identify the existence of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and semi-quantitatively estimate its rate in the coastal area of Vizhinjam, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. Natural Rn-222 (half-life = 3.8 days) was used as a tracer of SGD because of its conservative nature, short half-life, easiness in measurement and high abundance in groundwater. An in situ radon (Rn-222) monitoring study conducted in this region indicated comparatively higher Rn-222 activities (average: 14.1 +/- 1.7 Bq/m(3)) in the coastal waters revealing significant submarine groundwater discharge. The SGD may be a combination of fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater that is controlled by the hydraulic gradient in the adjacent aquifer and varying tidal conditions in the coastal waters. Using a transient Rn-222 mass balance model for the coastal waters, SGD rates were computed and the average value was found to be 10.9 +/- 6.1 cm/day. These estimates are comparable with those reported in the literature. In general, identification and estimation of submarine groundwater discharge is important in the Indian context because of the possibility of large amounts of groundwater loss through its long coastline, that can be judiciously exploited to cater to the present water requirements for drinking and irrigation purposes.

AB  - The interconnected Icarai and Jurujuba embayments, set within the lower south-eastern portion of Guanabara Bay, SE-Brazil, have been subject to the direct input of domestic effluents and other associated contaminants from human activities in their watersheds. This study addresses the composition of carbon, nitrogen and molecular steroid markers of surface sediments (n = 24) and a short core (L = 47 cm), in order to evaluate the impact by sewage, the contribution between allochthonous and autochthonous derived organic matter and eutrophication of the embayments. Coprostanol concentrations revealed, when compared to other regions in Guanabara Bay, high contamination by sewage close to the point of sewage discharge in Icarai embayment. In contrast, the more enclosed and eutrophic Jurujuba embayment exhibited a larger contribution of autochthonous organic matter, as shown by the combination of cholesterol, dinosterol and, partially, also brassicasterol. The presence of stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol also indicated a minor contribution of organic matter from terrestrial plants, as revealed by principal component analysis. The sedimentary record of the Jurujuba embayment exhibited highest concentrations of all sterol markers in the top layer, corroborating the recent increase in the accumulation of sewage, plankton derived organic carbon and also eutrophication. Trend in degradation of organic matter was evidenced by sterol/stanol ratios and the behavior of dinosterol indicated that the embayment has been dominated by the accumulation of phytoplankton derived organic matter since earlier times.

AB  - The Rice Biotechnology Program of the Center for Research in Cellular and Molecular Biology (RBP-CIBCM) at the University of Costa Rica (UCR) started in 1990 the molecular characterization of the rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV) genome, and the development of plant tissue culture protocols for regeneration of local Costa Rican indica rice varieties, aiming at the production of transgenic plants resistant to the virus. The next research phase focused on the, development of resistant rice lines by means of genetic engineering of the Costa Rican varieties with RHBV sequences, in order to lend resistance to the virus and to the herbicide PPT, by expressing the bar gene. Transgenic lines produced were evaluated for their resistance to the RHBV and for PPT resistance under local field conditions, as well as for agronomic performance. Progress is currently leading to a shift from the testing of concepts and building up experience in production of transgenic plants, to field evaluation and deployment of modified rice varieties to farmers. For this purpose, the RBP-CIBCM is following a multi-step approach involving food and environmental safety assessment, and identifying and solving intellectual property rights (IPR) issues. The main goals are to design and implement IPR management and education policies, and to perform and audit the technologies and inputs used, and the ways in which these affect the commercialization of the final products. The Program is simultaneously exploring innovative ways to protect transgenic seeds and other research outputs.

AB  - Romney-cross ewe lambs (n = 27) were subjected to controlled environmental conditions to induce acute heat stress. The goals of the study were to: (1) determine appropriate physiological indicators of acute heat stress, (2) determine threshold rectal temperatures (T-r) for catecholamine and cortisol release, (3) determine effects on meat quality, and (4) assess the effect of dehydration on the above measures. There were 3 treatments: control (ambient temperature and humidity), heat stress (33degreesC, and 85-100% humidity), and heat stress combined with water deprivation. The duration of the treatment period was 12 h. Respiration rate (R-f) and rectal temperature (T-r) were highly correlated with increasing temperature humidity index (THI) (r > 0.75, P < 0.001), whereas heart rate was less responsive to THI (r = 0.30, P < 0.05). The welfare of these lambs was at risk at T-r greater than 40.5degreesC, a point at which respiration rate was maximal and unable to prevent further increases in T-r. Plasma cortisol concentrations were increased in heat-stressed lambs after T-r reached approximately 40.7degreesC. Plasma catecholamines were only elevated in lambs when T-r was greater than 42degreesC. The majority of lambs subjected to heat stress had a T-r less than 42degreesC, and there were no significant effects on meat quality. Despite exhibiting increases in plasma protein concentrations, there were no indications that dehydrated lambs were under additional stress during heat challenge in comparison with hydrated lambs.

AB  - The toxicity of Cr6+ was determined in a laboratory environment in the snail Helix aspersa aspersa. The effects on growth were evaluated on animals reared in controlled conditions at the age of one month that had been exposed for 28 d to increasing doses of Cr6+ mixed in with their food. Two experimental groups were set up with concentrations of chromium in the feed of 250 to 1,250 mu g/g (test 1) and 100 to 800 mu g/g (test 2). Growth inhibition was dose dependent, and the mean EC50 calculated at four weeks for tests 1 and 2 were, respectively, 354.7 and 298.8 mu g/g and for the EC10 195.3 and 160.9 mu g/g. The levels of Cr6+ bioaccumulated in the foot and the viscera of the snails were dose dependent in both types of tissues. The highest concentrations occurred in the viscera, the levels being 0.79 mu g/g in the controls and reaching 3,067 mu g/g in the animals exposed to the maximum contamination (1,250 mu g/g). These high levels of bioaccumulation in addition to the lower concentrations of Cr6+ excreted in the feces than those present in the food suggest that chromium is not physiologically regulated by Helix aspersa. The results provide added support for the use of snails as a model to determine the toxicity of substances in laboratory biotests by measuring the effects on growth and by assessing bioaccumulation.

AB  - Microbiological quality of shellfish production areas along the French coast is assessed through quantification of fecal coliforms, commonly used as indicators of fecal pollution. Their concentration is measured in filter-feeding molluscs, presumed to integrate highly fluctuating quantities of these germs from the surrounding filtrated water. In the context of a bacteriological monitoring network, knowledge of contamination spatial structures may help for further optimal sampling designs. This study aims at applying geostatistical techniques to describe and characterize the spatial structure of the fecal contamination in mussels (Mytilus edulis) over a given production area (Havre de la Vanlee, France), located in macrotidal waters. In comparison with common interpolation methods, the kriging estimator, a basic tool in geostatistics, presents the major advantage of providing unbiased estimates with known and minimum variances. It thus appears to be the most powerful procedure to produce contour maps for the concentration estimates and their standard deviations. Differences in mean concentration between the two conducted surveys are compared with differences in concentration found in continental inputs. Although two surveys are not sufficient to assess accurately spatio-temporal variabilities, the use of kriging reveals high spatial heterogeneity, with different structures and meteorological conditions from one survey to the other. This leads to questioning the validity of a monitoring based on a few sampling stations over a large area sampled monthly to estimate a mean bacteriological level.

AB  - Vegetated sites below bird-nesting cliffs are uniquely nutrient-rich habitats in the otherwise nutrient-poor arctic environment. Plants from six distinct vegetation zones below such a cliff at 79 degrees N, Svalbard, Norway, were collected for analysis under greenhouse conditions. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was analysed in 42 species representing 25 % of the SvaIbard vascular flora. The species mean NRA values ranged from 0.37 to 8.34 mu mols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Species in the vegetated zone growing closest to recent guano deposits had the highest NRA values, (mean = 4.47) whereas plants growing farther below the cliff had significantly lower values (mean = 0.55).
   A similar pattern was detected in a duplicate set of plants induced with 15 mM KNO3; vegetation zone means for NRA ranged from 5.08 to 0.98 mu mols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Maximally induced species NRA values were highest in the first zones below the cliff and decreased downslope. This gradient paralleled the steep soil nitrate gradient, which decreased from 13.84 mg/l at the cliff-base to 1.03 mg/l downslope. Correspondingly, soil ammonium ions in the vegetation zones ranged between 1.96 mg/l at the cliff-base to 0.03 mg/l downslope. Correlations between NRA and soil nitrate provide a systematic basis for assigning scalar 'nitrogen figures' as indicators of habitat preference, here for the first time applied to arctic species.

AB  - The Upper Permian Wutonggou Formation, near Turpan, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China, consists of about 60 m of siltstones, sandstones and limestones. A 15 cm thick limestone bed about 40 m above the base, contains abundant bivalve shells of the species Palaeanodonta fisheri. P. castor and Palaeomutela sp. These relatively thick shells are chalky-white and the internal microstructure is preserved in some specimens as complex-crossed lamellas, which are always aragonite, and prismatic fibers which may be aragonite or calcite. Mineralogical tests confirm aragonite in microstructurally pristine specimens. This is the oldest-known locality for biogenic aragonite in China.
   The bivalves of northwestern China are geochemically distinct from typically marine and terrestrial counterparts. Their Sr, Mg, Mn, and Fe contents are strongly habitat controlled by ambient environmental conditions and support the postulated lacustrine paleoecology for the limestones of the Wutonggou Formation.
   Modelling of deltaC-13 values (-2.9 to -3.9 parts per thousand, PDB) and Fe suggests that Palaeanodonta and Palaeomutela preferred shallow waters and the values are well within the seasonal variation expected for north temperate lakes. The light and relatively constant deltaO-18 values (-12.0 to -12.1 parts per thousand, PDB) of the bivalves suggest that Wutonggou surface lake waters were probably well mixed. The modeled deltaO-18 value of -11 to -15 parts per thousand (SMOW) for annual meteoric precipitation, influenced by snow meltwater, appears reasonable for situated about 50-60-degrees-N of the Permian equator.

AB  - Pre-emergence herbicides, such as indaziflam, have agronomic efficiency when available in the soil solution, mainly in the superficial layer (0-10 cm), the region with the highest concentration of weed seed bank. However, information about the sorption of indaziflam in Brazilian soils still is scarce, since most studies available in the literature were conducted in soils of temperate regions. The objective of this study was to estimate the sorption of indaziflam using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and bioassay in a Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo (Oxisol) and in a Cambissolo (Inceptisol), at pH values of 5.1 and 6.1. In the biossay, Sorghum bicolor was used as an indicator plant. Quantitative indaziflam data were obtained by HPLC, and the sorption and desorption coefficients were determined in the soils using Freundlich isotherms. Increasing the pH of the two soils from 5.1 to 6.1 resulted in reductions of C-50 and sorption coefficient values. Desorption, a parameter estimated only by HPLC, showed an inverse behavior to that of sorption, that is, the lowest desorption was observed in the condition of highest sorption. It is concluded that the increase in pH of the studied soils reduces indaziflam sorption, influencing the recommendations of this herbicide, from both the agronomic and the environmental points of view. When the goal is to verify the presence or absence of indaziflam in the studied soils, the bioassay technique has satisfactory efficiency. Chromatographic assay is necessary when quantifying the concentration of this herbicide in the soil.

AB  - This research study presents the experimental assessment of two sensible heat materials originating from the State of Yucat ' an, Mexico, which were incorporated into three compartments within an indirect type solar dryer with a storage system (ITSD-TSS). The experimental tests were carried out under different environmental conditions and were compared with the results obtained from a conventional solar dryer without thermal storage. Temperature and humidity were measured during the different tests and various indicators were used to compare both drying systems. The results revealed that the solar dryer that used limestone as storage material indicated better performance than the dryer that utilized beach sand, since the drying efficiency with limestone was higher by 1.55% and allowed to extract 0.0257 kg more water per unit kWh. Similarly, beach sand stored 1.5 times more energy than limestone, however, this material is very susceptible to variations of solar radiation, so it is not recommended to implement it in areas with high cloudiness. Finally, the implementation of the three storage compartments in the ITSD-TSS allowed an increase between 3 and 4% of the drying efficiency as compared to the conventional solar dryer. The findings of the work can contribute to sustainable development in the agricultural drying process in rural communities.

AB  - Background The determination of CA 15-3 is useful for monitoring breast cancer patients. Several retrospective studies determined CA 15-3 levels in frozen samples to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of novel biomarkers in relation to breast cancer; however, freeze-thaw cycles, as well as preanalytical variables before sample storage, are not always reported. Here, we analyzed the current scientific literature to identify possible critical aspects related to CA 15-3 determination in frozen-stored human serum/plasma samples. Methods We obtained data from 4 different bibliographic databases: Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. We followed the PRISMA guidelines to screen and select the eligible articles discussed in the final revision. Results Initially, 674 scientific papers were evaluated, and after the application of the screening and eligibility criteria, 18 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The analysis reported an important level of heterogeneity concerning the preanalytical phase before sample storage. Conclusion Although advances in healthcare have been achieved using certified workflows in medical diagnostics, standardized preanalytical processes are not always applied when referring to frozen-stored biosamples. Biobanks will guarantee the best possible conditions for the storage of human biological samples to be used in clinical research. The use of certified bioresources will favor the optimal development and introduction of new disease biomarkers.

AB  - The morphological characteristics of yardangs are the direct evidence that reveals the wind and fluvial erosion for lacustrine sediments in arid areas. These features can be critical indicators in reconstructing local wind directions and environment conditions. Thus, the fast and accurate extraction of yardangs is key to studying their regional distribution and evolution process. However, the existing automated methods to characterize yardangs are of limited generalization that may only be feasible for specific types of yardangs in certain areas. Deep learning methods, which are superior in representation learning, provide potential solutions for mapping yardangs with complex and variable features. In this study, we apply Mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN) to automatically delineate and classify yardangs using very high spatial resolution images from Google Earth. The yardang field in the Qaidam Basin, northwestern China is selected to conduct the experiments and the method yields mean average precisions of 0.869 and 0.671 for intersection of union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.75, respectively. The manual validation results on images of additional study sites show an overall detection accuracy of 74%, while more than 90% of the detected yardangs can be correctly classified and delineated. We then conclude that Mask R-CNN is a robust model to characterize multi-scale yardangs of various types and allows for the research of the morphological and evolutionary aspects of aeolian landform.

AB  - Riparian forests present biotic and abiotic factors that influence environmental dissimilarity. which reflect specific fern distribution. The purpose of this this study was to evaluate the environmental heterogeneity associated to the terrestrial fern communities in riparian forest remnants in the grasslands southern half of Rio Grande do Sul state . We sampled ten 5x5 m plots in each site (AI,AII and AIII), totaling 30 plots. In each plot, fern species were inventoried and vegetative, microclimatic and edaphic parameters were collected. A total of 24 species were surveyed in the three riparian forest remnants, distributed in 19 genera and 10 families. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed that plots of AI had the highest temperature and aluminum values, while humidity was the lowest, which was reflected in the decrease of ferns richness. Soil moisture and air humidity were variables more related to the plots of AII and AII, indicating that these plants were favored in these environments. The floristic identity characteristic of each site suggests that many species are dependent to certain local environmental conditions. In this sense, even in very geographically close sites, riparian remnants deserve conservation attention, since they are capable of harboring high diversity in this grassland phytophysiognomy in southern Brazil. The results of this integrated study, with vegetation, climatic, and edaphic parameters, suggest, as expected, that ferns categorically respond to the heterogeneity shown by riparian environments, even when fragments are geographically very close to each other.

AB  - This study examines the performance of Japanese electric power companies from 2003 to 2020. We use an observed data set from 2003 to 2015 and a forecasted data set from 2016 to 2020. The Japanese deregulation of the industry needs to be completed by April 2020. As a method, this study uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) environmental assessment, which measures performance from a holistic perspective. This research adds a new analytical capability to the DEA-based assessment by including an analytical ability to handle an "imprecise" data set. We apply the proposed approach to investigate the performance of these companies before and after the disaster of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (11 March 2011). All electric power companies have suffered from business damage due to the nuclear disaster. The Japanese government has developed a policy scheme on how to recover from the huge handling costs resulting from the disaster. Nuclear energy has been long considered the most useful approach to handle climate change. However, many industrial nations have changed policy direction since the nuclear disaster. The Japanese government allocates the costs to not only Tokyo Electric Power Company, which produced the nuclear disaster, but also the other incumbent electric power companies that own nuclear power plants. Under the current Japanese scheme, financial conditions have been gradually recovering from the damage due to the managerial efforts and by indirectly allocating the expenditure to consumers and tax payers.

AB  - Increasingly, indexes serve not only as descriptive but also as true decision support tools with the potential to influence important policies. These policies, however, may fail if based on a misinterpreted or doubted index. While a thorough index validation could significantly improve this situation, such validation is scarcely provided by socioeconomic studies presenting new indexes. The present study bridges this gap by providing a thorough index validation in the general case when a newly designed index (i) defines a new sustainability entity and (ii) serves not only as a relative but also as an absolute measure.
   We formulate the four-pillar tax sustainability concept based on which we design the tax sustainability index. To keep the index design objective, we employ official data only, limit professional judgments in the design process, and introduce an original technical weighting procedure. We verify the index design and develop a two-stage simulation-based validation. In particular, we validate (i) the compliance of the index with the tax sustainability concept and (ii) the tax sustainability thresholds and conditions. The suggested simulation procedures allow us to empirically validate the sustainability index despite limited data. The results show that tax sustainability cannot be achieved without sustainability in the institutional pillar. Hence, as thoroughly validated, the tax sustainability index may serve as a decision support tool enabling the implementation of sustainable tax practices at the national and EU levels.

AB  - ECG recordings were obtained using an implanted telemetry device from the South American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus, held under stable conditions without restraining cables or interaction with researchers. Mean heart rate (f(H)) recovered rapidly (<24 h) from anaesthesia and operative procedures. This preceded a more gradual development of heart rate variability (HRV), with instantaneous f(H) increasing during each lung ventilation cycle. Atropine injection increased mean f(H) and abolished HRV. Complete autonomic blockade revealed a cholinergic tonus on the heart of 55% and an adrenergic tonus of 37%. Power spectral analysis of HRV identified a peak at the same frequency as ventilation. This correlation was sustained after temperature changes and it was more evident, marked by a more prominent power spectrum peak, when ventilation is less episodic. This HRV component is homologous to that observed in mammals, termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Evidence for instantaneous control of f(H) indicated rapid conduction of activity in the cardiac efferent nervous supply, as supported by the description of myelinated fibres in the cardiac vagus. Establishment of HRV 10 days after surgical intervention seems a reliable indicator of the re-establishment of control of integrative functions by the autonomic nervous system. We suggest that this criterion could be applied to other animals exposed to natural or imposed trauma, thus improving protocols involving animal handling, including veterinarian procedures.

AB  - This article offers a first large scale analysis of argumentative polylogues in the fracking controversy. It provides an empirical methodology (macroscope) that identifies, from large quantities of text data through semantic frame analysis, the many players, positions and places presumed relevant to argumentation in a controversy. It goes beyond the usual study of framing in communication research because it considers that a controversy's communicative context is shaped, and in turn conditions, the making and defending of standpoints. To achieve these novels aims, theoretical insights from frame semantics, knowledge driven argument mining, and argumentative polylogues are combined. The macroscope is implemented using the Semafor parser to retrieve all the semantic frames present in a large corpus about fracking and then observing the distribution of those frames that semantically presuppose argumentative features of polylogue (meta-argumentative indicators). The prominent indicators are Taking sides (indicator of "having an argument"), Evidence and Reasoning (indicators of "making an argument"). The automatic retrieval of the words associated with the core elements of the semantic frame enables the mapping of how different players, positions, and discussion venues are assembled around what is treated as disagreeable in the controversy. This knowledge driven approach to argument mining reveals prototypical traits of polylogues related to environmental issues. Moreover, it addresses a problem in conventional frame analysis common in environmental communication that focuses on the way individual arguments are presented without effective consideration of the argumentative relevance the semantics and pragmatics of certain frames operating across discourses.

AB  - The organic geochemical characteristics of Soma-Eynez coals located in the southwest section of the Soma Neogene Basin in Turkey were examined, and the depositional environment and maturity levels were evaluated. The analyzed samples were drilling samples taken from the Lower Coal Seam (KM2) to represent the basin. The coal's total organic carbon (TOC) content is 28.45-73.38%, potential yield (PY) value is 22.43-168.29, and extractable organic matter (EOM) yield is 1204-29774 ppm, which are all indicators that the source rock has excellent hydrocarbon-production potential. T-max values are between 389 and 430 degrees C, indicating an immature stage for hydrocarbon production. This is further supported by biomarker maturity parameters (a high odd-to-even predominance index (OEP), low 20S/(20S + 20R) sterane ratio, low beta beta/(beta beta + alpha alpha) sterane ratio, low 22S/(22S + 22R)(C-32) homohopane ratio, and low C29Ts/C29Ts + C29H ratio). Unresolved complex mixtures (UCMs) observed in gas chromatograms point to immature low mature nonbiodegraded organic matter. The saturated biomarker fractions of KM2 coals are characterized by a high Tm/Ts (C-27 17 alpha-trisnorhopane/C-27 18 alpha-trisnorhopane) ratio, high Pr/Ph ratio, dominant C-29 regular sterane presence, and high C-30*/C29Ts ratio. All biomarker parameters showed that terrestrial higher plant materials and algal/bacterial source organisms collectively deposited in the paleo-swamp and under suboxic-oxic conditions.

AB  - There are many ways to determine financial health of a company. Classic tools of financial analysis emphasize data in financial statements. When frying to reach an overall classification of a company, e.g. from the point of view of an investor, indicators of profitability, liquidity, leverage and activity might generate contradictory clues regarding financial health of the company. Such analysis does not only generate ambiguous results, but is also lengthy. Therefore, the IN05 financial model was created for particular specifics of the Czech Republic economic environment to predict prosperity of companies. It measures the prosperity on the base of economic value added (EVA). More than ten years have passed since the launch of the IN05 index. The aim of this study is to quantify contemporary prediction strength of the IN05 index on a sample of almost 500 companies. Moreover, an effort was made to enhance the accuracy of the model for particular branches of manufacturing industries. It was found that contemporary explanatory power of the index IN05 is 48.58 when applying the original evaluation scale, and 70.79 % when assessing 68.62 % of the sample except the gray zone. The accuracy of the model was enhanced by the author in all categories, i.e. a higher accuracy (correct prediction probability) without considering the gray zone and higher accuracy (conditioned correct prediction probability) using the gray zones in all branches of manufacturing industries. Robustness of these results was verified on another sample of 195 companies.

AB  - The steppe zone is not only a unique natural and geographical formation, but also within the framework of European Russia a special region with specific socio-economic and demographic processes. In this article, we consider the issues of town-planning ranking of rural settlements on the basis of comparing the dynamics of their population as the most unique of all socio-economic indicators. Methods. To assess the dynamics of the population, we used the difference in population numbers over a five-year 142 period from 2012 to 2016. When ranking settlements on the dynamics trend, 7 groups were identified, the results were mapped and analyzed. Results. Town-planning ranking has made it possible to identify the most depressive regions that gravitate toward the peripheral territories of the regions, join the borders of neighboring entities, and also form a "frontier" along the Russian-Kazakh border. The most promising areas are located in the south-west of the region under consideration (Krasnodar, Stavropol Krai, south of the Rostov region), where favorable economic and natural-climatic conditions are combined. In addition, promising rural settlements gravitate toward the administrative centers of the regions. Main conclusions. Based on the ranking we have identified trends in the decline of socio-economic indicators from west to east, the negative impact of the Russian-Kazakh border and the periphery of the territory, the growth of prospects towards the Black Sea coast, as well as "urbanization polarization", expressed in the compression of the regional urban space to urbanized centers.

AB  - The continuing rise in fossil fuel use significantly aggravates global warming problems because of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This article shows a procedure to indirectly obtain data concerning the environmental pollution of a tractor by starting from direct data. The research confirms that qualitative indicators of a tractor's work for an operational period could be identified from a database compiled from engine processors. The average work rate of tractors measured under field conditions, together with the operating time in an engine's work mode, fuel consumption, and CO2 and CO emissions, have been measured. Correlations between CO2 and CO emissions and the NTE (not-to-exceed) zones during a tractor's operational period have also been determined. The study showed that the tractors worked, on average, 51% of the operational period with the engine working modes within the NTE zone. While working in these modes, the tractors consumed approximately 73.4% of the fuel used for the whole operational period, and emitted into the environment approximately 76% of the CO2 and 9.7% of the CO of the emissions of the whole operational period. It was found that there are possibilities to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 and CO emissions during tractor operational periods by improving the tractor's operation by choosing engine work modes in a more rational way.

AB  - Understanding ecological requirements of endangered species is a primary precondition of successful conservation practice. Regrettably, we know surprisingly little about the life history of numerous threatened insects, and about their use of larval host plants in particular. The brown butterflies (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) have traditionally been considered polyphagous on grasses and indiscriminatory in their oviposition behavior. However, detailed studies on several species have revealed local specialization in host plant use as well as the decisive role of microlimatic conditions as determinants of habitat quality. The present study addresses host plant relationships in the endangered brown butterfly Coenonympha hero (L.) at the northern limit of its European distribution. We combine laboratory-based host preference and performance tests with an analysis of microhabitat use by adult butterflies in the field. Both lines of evidence suggest that C. hero is polyphagous enough not to be associated with one particular host species. Oviposition choices of C. hero are not driven by host plant species but rather by structural characteristics of the substrate. The preferred rigid needle-like structures may serve as cues of 'transparent' vegetation which allows the larvae to benefit from sunlight reaching the lower strata of the tuft. Our results suggest that conservation efforts should prioritize microclimatic parameters, rather than the presence of any particular host plant species, as decisive determinants of habitat quality in C. hero.

AB  - The study was carried out in Narta and Orikumi Lagoon (Vlora Bay), to evaluate the environmental status and to extent the pollution level by different contamination sources in these areas. Physico-chemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, TSS, TDS, temperature, salinity etc), nutrients (N-NO3-, N-NO2-, N-NH4+ and P-PO43-) and heavy metal (Hg, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr and Cd) content in water samples collected in Narta and Orikumi Lagoon were used for the assessment of the environmental situation of the lagoons. Samples were collected in ten sampling sites, five in each lagoon. A water sample collected in Vlora Bay was used as a comparative sample.
   Total dissolved metal concentrations were analyzed by graphite furnace AAS (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu), flame system AAS (Zn) and CV-AAS (Hg) known as a very sensitive analytical methods. The trend of heavy metals content in water of the lagoons resulted as following: Zn>Cu>Cr>(Cd and/or Pb)>Hg. Nutrients (N-NO3-, N-NO2-, N-NH4+ and P-PO43-) content was determined by spectrophotometric methods.
   The data matrix of analytical parameters was statistically treated with Descriptive Statistics and multivariate analysis by using MINITAB 17 software package. Based on the Cluster Analysis, the sampling stations were classified into 3 main clusters. Based on the results of physicochemical parameters, nutrients and heavy metals content in studied areas, it is shown that Narta and Orikumi Lagoon are characterized by generally oligotrophic conditions and are suitable for fish growth.

AB  - Site-specific information on land management practices are often desired to make better assessments of their environmental impacts. A study was conducted in Lubbock, Texas, in the Southern High Plains of the United States, an area characterized by semi-arid climatic conditions, to (1) examine the potential management-induced alterations in soil salinity indicators in golf course facilities and (2) develop predictive relationships for a more rapid soil salinity examination within these urban landscape soils using findings from a portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometer. Soil samples were collected from managed (well irrigated) and non-managed (non-irrigated) areas of seven golf course facilities at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depths and analyzed for a suite of chemical properties. Among the extractable cations, sodium (Na) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the managed zones of all the golf facilities. Soil electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), parameters often used in characterizing soil salinity and sodicity, were for the most part significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the managed areas. Water quality reports collected over a 22-year period (1991-2013, all years not available) indicated a gradual increase in pH, EC, SAR, total alkalinity, and extractable ions, thus supporting the former findings. Findings from the PXRF suggested possible differences in chemical species and sources that contribute to salinity between the managed and non-managed zones. PXRF-quantified Cl and S, and to a lesser extent Ca, individually and collectively explained 23-85% of the variability associated with soil salinity at these facilities.

AB  - European Commission regulation 2073/2005 on the microbiological criteria for food requires that Escherichia coli is monitored as an indicator of hygienic conditions. Since verocytotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) strains often cause food-borne infections by the consumption of raw food, the Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended their monitoring in food as well. In particular, VTEC strains belonging to serogroups such as O26, O103, O111, O145, and O157 are known causative agents of several human outbreaks. Eight real-time PCR methods for the detection of E. coli toxin genes and their variants (stx(1), stx(2)), the intimin gene (eae), and five serogroup-specific genes have been proposed by the European Reference Laboratory for VTEC (EURL-VTEC) as a technical specification to the European Normalization Committee (CEN TC275/WG6). Here we applied a "modular approach" to the in-house validation of these PCR methods. The modular approach subdivides an analytical process into separate parts called "modules," which are independently validated based on method performance criteria for a limited set of critical parameters. For the VTEC real-time PCR module, the following parameters are being assessed: specificity, dynamic range, PCR efficiency, and limit of detection (LOD). This study describes the modular approach for the validation of PCR methods to be used in food microbiology, using single-target plasmids as positive controls and showing their applicability with food matrices.

AB  - We present a Stochastic Space Random Cascade (SSRC) approach to downscale precipitation from a General Circulation Models (GCMs), developed for the assessment of water resources under climate change scenarios for the Oglio river (1440 km(2)), in the Italian Alps. The snow-fed Oglio river displays complex physiography and high environmental gradient and statistical downscaling methods are required for climate change assessment. First, a back cast analysis is carried out to evaluate the most representative within a set of four available GCMs (R30, ECHAM4, PCM, HadCM3). Monthly precipitation for the window 1990-2000 from 270 gauging stations (one every 25 km(2)) in northern Italy is used and scores from objective indicators are calculated. The SSRC model is then tuned upon the Oglio river catchment for spatial downscaling (2 km(2)) of daily precipitation from the NCAR Parallel Climate Model, giving the comparatively best results for the area. Scale Recursive Estimation coupled with the Expectation Maximization algorithm is used for model estimation. The seasonal parameters of the multiplicative cascade are accommodated by statistical distributions conditioned upon the climatic forcing, based on a regression analysis. The SSRC approach reproduces well the spatial clustering, intermittency, self-similarity, and spatial correlation structure of precipitation fields, with relatively low computational burden. Downscaling of future precipitation scenarios (A2 scenario from the Parallel Climate Model) is then carried out and some preliminary conclusions are drawn.

AB  - Short-lived species are extremely dependent on the seasonal and interannual variability of environmental conditions, and determining their stock status is often difficult. This study investigates the effects of environmental variability and fishing pressure on the stock of octopus Octopus vulgaris in Senegalese waters over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005. Monthly catches-at-age were estimated based on catch-at-weight data and a polymodal decomposition constrained by a given growth curve. Octopus recruitments and fishing mortalities were then estimated using a catch-at-age analysis performed on a monthly basis. Yield and biomass per recruit were simulated using a Thompson and Bell model and used to generate a diagnostic of the fishery's impacts. Results indicate that the high interannual and seasonal variability of the octopus stock biomass is linked to the spring recruitment event, the annual intensity of which was significantly correlated with the coastal upwelling index and sea surface temperature. Yield per recruit varied seasonally but remained almost unchanged from one year to the next. Even when catches vary strongly according to recruitment, the octopus stock appears to be consistently fully exploited, or slightly overexploited in some years. In this context of environmental variability, usual indicators such as the maximum yield per recruit, and the related fishing mortality and spawning potential ratio, remain useful for fisheries management purposes.

AB  - Gasoline range hydrocarbons (C-5-C-12) are usually associated with petroleum generation, yet few surface geochemical surveys have attempted to evaluate the gasoline range hydrocarbons in near-surface marine sediments. This is due to the difficulty in capturing and analyzing this volatile range of hydrocarbons with minimum loss and evaporative fractionation. In this study, a Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HSPME) method was developed and evaluated for the purpose of capturing the gasoline range of hydrocarbons within unconsolidated sediment using a solventless protocol.
   The sediment SPME extraction method is based on the condition that phase/composition equilibrium is reached between sediment/water mix, container headspace, and SPME fiber coated with sorbent. In the experiments, the effectiveness of SPME to detect and measure low concentrations of migrated crude oil in marine sediments was evaluated. The following optimum laboratory procedure for SPME gasoline monitoring was established: collect the sample in sealed disrupter chamber (sealed sediment storage container which breaks apart sediment and releases interstitial volatile hydrocarbons), use a water bath to keep a stable laboratory temperature, use an NaCl saturated solution to help aromatic compounds move out of the solution to vapor phase, and wait a sufficient time to reach equilibrium. The results show that HSPME is very sensitive with sub ppm detection limits. SPME proved to be suitable to reveal the natural background and micro-seepage level of gasoline hydrocarbons in marine sediments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land degradation is a problem prolific across semi-arid areas worldwide. Despite being a complex process including both biotic and abiotic elements, previous attempts to understand ecosystem dynamics have largely been carried out within disparate disciplines of ecology and hydrology, which has led to significant limitations. Here, an ecohydrological framework is outlined. to provide a new direction for the study of land degradation in semi-arid ecosystem. Unlike other frameworks that draw upon hierarchy theory to provide a board, non-explicit conceptual framework is based upon the explicit linkage of process operating over the continuum of temporal and spatial scales by perceiving the ecosystem as a series of structural and functional connections, within which interactions between biotic and abiotic components of the landscape occur. It is hypothesized that semi-arid land degradation conforms to a cusp-catastrophe model in which the two controlling variables are abiotic structural connectivity and abiotic functional connectivity, which implicitly account for ecosystem resilience, and biotic structural and function connectivity. It is suggest therefore that future research must (1) evaluate how abiotic and biotic function (i.e. water, sediment and nutrient loss/redistribution) vary over grass-shrub transitions and (2) quantify the biotic/abiotic structure over grass-shrub transitions, to (3) determine the interactions between ecosystem structure and function. and interaction/feedbacks between biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem.

AB  - Zoning and applying Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) are two promising strategies for managing tourism in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Typically, these management strategies require the collection and integration of ecological and socioeconomic data. This problem is illustrated by a case study of Koh Chang National Marine Park, Thailand. Biophysical surveys assessed coral communities in the MPA to derive indices of reef diversity and vulnerability. Social surveys assessed visitor perceptions and satisfaction with conditions encountered on snorkelling tours. Notably, increased coral mortality caused a significant decrease in visitor satisfaction. The two studies were integrated to prescribe zoning and "Limits of Acceptable Change" (LAC). As a biophysical indicator, the data suggest a LAC value of 0.35 for the coral mortality index. As a social indicator, the data suggest that a significant fraction of visitors would find a LAC value of under 30 snorkellers per site as acceptable. The draft zoning plan prescribed four different types of zones: (I) a Conservation Zone with no access apart from monitoring or research; (II) Tourism Zones with high tourism intensities at less vulnerable reefs; (III) Ecotourism zones with a social LAC standard of < 30 snorkellers per site, and (IV) General Use Zones to meet local artisanal fishery needs. This study illustrates how ecological and socioeconomic field studies in MPAs can be integrated to craft zoning plans addressing multiple objectives.

AB  - The effects of two farm manures, bovine manure (BM) and chicken manure (CM), on imazaquin degradation in a sandy loam soil were studied under laboratory conditions. The degradation of imazaquin in BM and CM-amended soil (10% by w/w) was about 2.4 and 1.5 times, respectively, faster than that in unamended soil. Different amendment ratios of BM to soil lead to different degradation rates of imazaquin. However, higher mix ratio did not necessarily increase the degradation, and the optimal active degradation of imazaquin was observed at the approximate mix ratio of 10:1 of soil to BM. Imazaquin degradation rate was enhanced 2 similar to 4 times in non-sterilized soil over that in SGI (sterilization by gamma irradiation) soil. In non-sterilized soil, biological mechanisms accounted for 48.7% to 74.6% of imazaquin degradation, which suggested that microbial transformation was the primary pathway for imazaquin degradation in soil. The degradation rate of imazaquin for SSA (sterilization by sodium azide) treatment was 1.33 and 1.26 times, respectively, over that for SA (sterilization by autoclaving) and SGI treatments. Imazaquin degradation half-life (13.2 d) in SGI soil with non-sterilized BM was 3.2 times faster than that in SGI soil without BM. In contrast, the slow degradation rate (0.0173 d(-1)) was observed in SGI soil with water-extracted nutrients from sterilized BM. The organic matter and water-extracted nutrients from sterilized manure had no effects on imazaquin degradation in soil.

AB  - In this paper we review current assumptions about post-productivist agricultural regimes - developed largely within a UK/advanced economies framework - and attempt to answer the question whether the concept of post-productivism can be used to understand contemporary agricultural change in developing world regions. Our analysis is loosely based around six interconnected 'indicators' of post-productivism: policy change; organic farming; counter-urbanization; the inclusion of environmental NGOs at the core of policy-making; the consumption of the countryside; and on-farm diversification activities. We argue that the successful 'exporting' of the theory of post-productivism to the South relies on shared definitions, meanings and - ultimately - discourses of post-productivism. Although similar patterns can be observed in rural areas of the developing world, there is confusion about the exact meaning of complex agricultural/rural activities. Further, our analysis questions the implied linearity of the traditional concept of the productivist/post-productivist transition. Ultimately, a relative assessment of the shift towards post-productivism would circumvent discursive problems related to definitions and meanings of specific post-productivist concepts and indicators. We conclude by arguing that the notion of post-productivism and the developing world are not necessarily 'discordant concepts', but we suggest that the concept needs to be adapted and developed to address specific conditions in the rural South, possibly by combining theoretical approaches surrounding the notion of 'post-productivism' developed largely from a Northern perspective, and 'deagrarianization' from a Southern perspective.

AB  - The environment in which we live greatly influences our health. One particular factor that has been related to morbidity and mortality is dwelling crowding. A range of mechanisms have been proposed as links between dwelling crowding and disease, including increased exposures to allergens, respiratory irritants and infectious agents in crowded dwellings. While studies of dwelling crowding have been conducted in many locations around the world, this factor has received little attention in Australian health studies. We examine relationships between dwelling crowding and health in Sydney, using three case studies at the local government area (LGA) level within the Sydney Statistical Division. Dwelling and demographic data from the 1996 Australian census are used, along with four socio-economic indexes produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and hospital inpatient data for the period 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1997 as the health indicator. Results suggest that dwelling crowding is a significant factor in certain diseases in Sydney. Asthma hospital separations are not correlated with dwelling crowding, although multiple linear regression analysis produces three models which include crowding and three of the socio-economic indexes as significant variables. Separations for bronchitis and emphysema, and all causes combined, are positively correlated with dwelling crowding. Dwelling crowding is strongly negatively correlated with all but one of the socio-economic indicators.

AB  - We studied the pattern of distribution of the common genet (Genetta genetta) in areas in mountains and plains of central Spain, in the middle of the range of the species. We evaluated the role of temperature, rainfall, and habitat features in determining the ecological limits of genet distribution. Genets were very scarce on plateaux and the upper parts of the mountains, but were widely distributed in lower mountain areas. Genets were present in areas with abundant shrub cover, high mean of the mean minimum temperature and high mean of mean winter temperatures. Survey routes at the same altitude (< 1000 m) in the mountains (genets abundant) and on the plateaux (genets very scarce) also differed in some of these variables, with low values on the plateaux for shrub cover, mean of the mean minimum temperatures, mean of the mean winter temperatures, and annual rainfall. Genets originated in Africa, therefore they are probably ill-adapted (morphologically and physiologically) for the cold conditions predominating in most of central Spain. Their preference for shrubby habitats may be linked to a greater availability of food and low risk of predation. Intermediate levels of rainfall may be correlated with higher temperatures, the key factor hypothesized to affect the distribution of this species. The distribution of the common genet fits a multimodal model, with peaks (presence) and valleys (absence) in the middle of its range, indicating that location in a particular part of the range is not a prior indicator of habitat suitability for the species.

AB  - Scaling is a major problem facing salt separation from water by reverse osmosis (RO) systems. The sophisticated saturation indices such as LSI (1936), RSI (1944), and S&DSI (1952), are widely used for the prediction of scaling potential in RO systems, although these indices were specifically developed for thermal heating equipment. The aim of this work is to provide a simplified tool to help in understanding the chemical nature of brine stream and its expected scaling potential under RO processing. This approach, based on close field observation, analyzes and investigates the actual formed scales, rather than relaying on inherited theories. Thirty-three cases were selected from RO plants that show common problems in scale formation and shortening of the membrane lifetime. In all of these cases, the production rate declined down to less than 50% after several months, and the membrane life shortened to about 1 year. It was found that the proposed molar ratios of the brine could be used as chemical indicators for the prediction of scale potential and its chemical nature as well under the RO processing. Positive relations and trends were found among the ion associations under the prevailing conditions of sudden pressure/dehydration on the membrane surface. The comparison of the saturation indices and the proposed molar-ratios concept shows that the validity of the latter is better than the saturation indices. The use of molar ratios could be of economic value in properly designing RO plants and optimizing subsequent operation and maintenance costs as well.

AB  - Sediment core M23414 from the Rockall Plateau (North Atlantic) covering the last two climatic cycles, marine isotope stages (MIS) 7 to 1, was investigated for glacial-interglacial variations in the deep-sea benthic ostracode fauna. A highly diversified ostracode fauna including 98 species was found. Two climate-related assemblages were identified, associated with interglacial and peak glacial periods, respectively. The 'interglacial' group occurs during the end of MIS 7, 5 and 1 and is composed of the genera Henryhowella, Pelecocythere, Echinocythereis, Cytherella, Bradleya, Aversovalva and Eucytherura. The 'glacial' group consists of the genera Acetabulastoma (which is known as 'sea ice indicator' in the modem Arctic Ocean), Polycope, Bythoceratina, ?Rhombobythere, and some species possibly belonging to the genus Pseudocythere and is found during MIS 6, 4 and 2. These longer-term variations within the ostracode fauna seem related to the particular glacial and interglacial climate conditions that affected both deep-water production as well as primary production in the surface waters. However, a detailed comparison of ostracode abundances with the occurrence of events marked by increased ice-rafted debris reveals also much shorter-term climate related changes in the ostracode fauna. Thus, the temporal fluctuations within ostracode assemblages reflect long- and short-term alterations of the deep-sea environment that are clearly linked to climate changes.

AB  - The biomarker distributions of crude oils are a valuable and complementary tool for understanding the provenance of source organic matter (OM) in intracratonic rift basins such as the Cambay Basin, India, which has five tectonic blocks from north to south. Distinctive biomarkers recorded in Cambay oils included tetrapolyprenoids, C29 28-nor-spergulane, diaryl isoprenoids and methylated chromans. Other diagnostic markers including oleanane, A-ring degraded hexanortriterpanes, bicadinanes and aromatic oleanoid/ursanoid triterpenoids, suggest substantial inputs to the OM from tropical angiosperm families. The biomarker distributions and various plots of the data, including a principal component analysis, indicate two distinct OM facies present in the basin. The depositional environment of the source OM that prevailed in the north blocks (NB) and south blocks (SB) of the basin are different, despite similar ages and geography. The results suggest that the NB oils were generated from mixed algal/microbial and higher plant-derived organic biomasses, deposited in suboxic to anoxic conditions, probably in a restricted marine or lacustrine environment. Contrarily, the oils of SB were generated from OM substantially derived from tropical lowland angiosperm rainforest trees, which were deposited under a fluviodeltaic environment with a suboxic to oxic setting. The various maturity parameters reveal that northern oils are marginally less mature than the southern oils.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the thermal performance of PCM and PCM combined with nighttime natural (NV) and mechanical ventilation (MV) applied to a residential building located in eight cities of tropical rainforest climate zone (Af). The analysis was accomplished using numerical simulations and developing a unique methodology for selecting the PCM melting temperature based on the thermal comfort limits. The thermal performance of the PCM integrated building was quantitatively evaluated using the concept of peak temperature drop. Additionally, a novel indicator of Total Temperature Drop (TTD) was introduced to determine the overall impact of the PCM and PCM combined with NV/MV on the thermal comfort conditions inside the building. The results showed that PCM 28 was the most efficient in improving the thermal performance of the building located in the Af climate zone, achieving a TTD of up to 356 degrees C per year. The usage of PCM 28 combined with nighttime natural ventilation improved the TTD values by up to 15%, whereas the integration of PCM 28 combined with mechanical ventilation resulted in a TTD values increase of up to 45%. Conclusively, mechanical ventilation showed its superiority over natural ventilation in the tropical rainforest climate, and PCM 28 applied together with mechanical ventilation could be used as the optimum combination for the whole climate zone.

AB  - Fertiliser dissolution is usually carried out in a differential pressure tank. Fertiliser concentration at tank outlet is essential information for the correct control of optimum fertilisation. To enable optimisation, a fertiliser concentration equation was derived from the continuity equation with a source term. The source term described fertiliser dissolution using the initial dissolution rate and a decay rate of dissolution. An analytical equation was obtained from the fertiliser concentration equation for a traditional fertilisation process. The analytical equation fitted experimental data well, providing significantly good quantitative predictions. The equation reduces to the standard exponential form when the source term disappears. The influence of the fertiliser dissolution and outflow on concentration variation is discussed. An optimum fertilisation method considering dissolution is further proposed to provide constant fertigation flux and optimum fertiliser concentration based on the fertiliser concentration equation. The optimum fertilisation method controls a flux division of the fertigation system. Fertiliser dissolution is analysed for its influences on the flux division and fertiliser concentration at tank outlet under optimum conditions. Fertiliser dissolution increases the optimum fertilisation time, and leads to reduced inlet flux compared with the optimum fertilisation case without fertiliser dissolution. Environmental impact assessment is discussed by comparing optimum fertilisation to traditional fertilisation. The optimum fertilisation method could offer positive to fertiliser management and environmental protection by avoiding the excessive nitrogen and phosphorus losses found in traditional fertilisation.

AB  - Background: The enriched nitrogenous compounds in the dairy farms negatively affect the surrounding soil quality and air condition. The objective of this study is to investigate the transcriptomes of five key tissues involved in nitrogen metabolism and their changes under different diets to elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanisms of urine urea nitrogen (UUN) yield, one of the indicators of nitrogenous compound secretion of dairy cows. Results: Cows fed high quality forage-based diet had lower UUN content and UUN yield, compared to those fed low quality forage (crop byproducts) based diets. From the transcriptomes of rumen, duodenum, jejunum, liver and udder, key driver genes and their UUN yield-associated functional gene networks were identified. In addition, the functional networks and expression of key drivers in various tissues (such as S100A8, CA1 and BPIFA2C in the duodenum; A2ML1, HMGCS2 and S100A12 in the jejunum; CYP2B6 and GLYCAM1 in the liver; APOE in the udder) changed in the cows fed crop byproducts based diet, which might be the predominant molecules to drive the increase UUN yield in these cows. Conclusion: The information suggested that gut, liver and udder play important roles in regulating UUN yield, which could regulate nitrogen excretion waste. These findings provide fundamental information on future nutritional intervention strategies to reduce the UUN yield from dairy cows fed human inedible crop byproducts, which is vital for a sustainable and environmentally friendly dairy industry.

AB  - Masculinity-related morphological traits are supposed to be honest indicators of a man's biological quality. While some studies showed that sexually dimorphic traits are related to various aspects of biological condition such as general health, immunity or fertility, still little is known about the relationship between masculine traits and the effectiveness of innate and adaptive immunity in humans. The aim of this study was to see if masculine traits, which are dependent on androgen levels in foetal and pubertal stages of development, are related to the immune quality in healthy men. The immune quality was evaluated for 91 healthy men aged 19-36 years. Immunity measurements included innate and adaptive parameters. General health status, age, testosterone level, BMI, physical activity, and smoking were controlled. The shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR), 2D:4D digit ratio and hand-grip strength (HGS) were used as markers of masculinization. The regressions showed that when controlling for confounds, masculinity-related traits were in general not related to innate and adaptive immunity. Only a weak association was observed for right 2D:4D ratio and T-lymphocyte counts (but it becomes non-significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Our results do not support the premise that masculinity is a cue for immunological quality in men. However, the positive association between right 2D:4D and T lymphocytes might suggest that further studies are needed to verify if androgen stimulation in prenatal development might be related to immunity in adulthood.

AB  - Displaying Nitrogen (N) indicators on a global grid poses unique opportunities to quantify environmental impacts from N application in different world regions under a variety of conditions. Such calculations require the use of maps showing the geo-spatial distribution of crop production. Although there are several crop maps in the scientific literature to choose from, the consequences of this choice for the calculation of N indicators still need to be evaluated. In this study we analyze the differences in results for N Use Efficiency (NUE) and N surplus calculated on the global scale using two different crop maps (SPAM and M3). For our calculations we used publicly available statistical and literature data combined with each crop map and carefully traced the origins of the differences in the results. Our results showed that the regions most affected by discrepancies caused by differences in crop maps (yields and physical area) are Central Asia and the Russian Federation, Australia and Oceania, and North Africa. However, we also found that the inclusion or exclusion of grass crops influences the results, as does the aggregation of crops to categories. Considering all these differences, we note that M3 seems to provide the more plausible results for the calculation of N indicators. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of determining the critical parameters for N indicator calculation, but also allows key parameters connected with N use and overuse to be identified on the global scale.

AB  - The present research was carried out to study drought and its effects upon water resources using remote sensing data. To this end, the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellite precipitation, the synoptic stations, and fountain discharge data were employed. For monitoring of drought in the study area, in Kermanshah province, Iran, the monthly precipitation data of the synoptic stations along with TRMM satellite precipitation datasets were collected and processed in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. Statistical indicators were applied to evaluate the accuracy of TRMM precipitation against the meteorological stations' data. Standardized precipitation index, SPI, and normalized fountain discharge were used in the monitoring of drought conditions, and fountains discharge, respectively. The fountains were selected so that in addition to enjoying the most discharge rates, they spread along the study area. The evaluation of precipitation data showed that the TRMM precipitation data were of high accuracy. Studies in temporal scale are indicative of the strike of drought in this region to the effect that for most months of the year, frequency and duration in dry periods are much more than in wet periods. As for seasonal scales, apart from winter, the frequency and duration of drought in spring and autumn have been longer than in wet years. Moreover, the duration of these periods was different. A comparison between the results of changes in fountain discharges and drought index in the region has verified that the drought has caused a remarkable decline in the fountain discharges.

AB  - Previous studies on Chepaizi Uplift mainly focused on its reservoirs, and the potential source rocks natively occurred was ignored. During the exploration process, dark mudstones and tuffaceous mudstones were found in the Carboniferous interval. These possible source rocks have caused great concern about whether they have hydrocarbon generation potential and can contribute to the reservoirs of the Chepaizi Uplift. In this paper, the potential source rocks are not only evaluated by the organic richness, type, maturity, and depositional environment, but also divided into different kinetics groups. The Carboniferous mudstones dominated by Type III kerogen were evolved into the stage of mature. Biomarkers indicate that the source rocks were deposited in a marine environment under weakly reducing conditions and received mixed aquatic and terrigenous organic matter, with the latter being predominant. The effective source rocks are characterized by the total organic carbon values >0.5 wt.% and the buried depth >1500 m. The tuffaceous mudstone shows a greater potential for its lower active energy and longer hydrocarbon generation time. Considering the hydrocarbon generation potential, base limits of the total organic carbon and positive correlation of oil-source rock together, the native Carboniferous mudstones and tuffaceous mudstones might contribute to the Chepaizi Uplift reservoirs of the northwestern region of the Junggar Basin, especially the deeper effective source rocks should be paid enough attention to.

AB  - With steadily rising affluence levels within a jurisdiction and across the globe, forests are expected to play an increasing role in satisfying human needs for ecosystem services as well as recreational, cultural and spiritual demands. Companies that manage forests to provide goods and services are expected to satisfy the social license to operate as well as market-driven supply and demand conditions. The social license to operate has evolved to reflect shifting societal values, orientations of the regulatory regimes and the interplays of various forces mediating the diverse interests of stakeholders. The social license to operate is predicated to encompass society's growing desire of managing forests for the greater good. Examples from North American context suggest that forest companies have embraced their corporate social responsibility and made a conscious effort to implement the social license to operate. Forest management regimes have a tendency of unfolding within a nested system that resembles Russian nesting dolls of Matrioshka. The strength of the social license to operate serves as an important indicator for predicting the extent to which enterprises are able to meet a spectrum of stratified, compartmentalized, yet interconnected, management objectives. Forest companies, public agencies and resource professionals will benefit from a better understanding of contextualized social license to operate, which is subject to change on account of community consent, citizen endorsement and society-wide support. However, managing forests for the greater good will remain a lofty goal, which serves as foresters' North Star on their journey toward sustainable forest management.

AB  - Globally, floodplain wetlands have been dramatically impacted by changes in water regimes. A key indicator of change in wetland state is riparian and aquatic plant community composition. Plant communities are traditionally assessed by visual monitoring programs that assess community composition. However, results from these monitoring programs may be effected by antecedent conditions that govern plant growth, such as season. In this study we used environmental DNA (eDNA) to assess the spatial composition of wetland vegetation communities from six floodplain complexes along the Murray River, Australia and compared results to those derived from tradition plant surveys. Our analyses of eDNA were conducted targeting two gene regions: 18S RNA and trnL at the species and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) levels. Analysis revealed significant similarity between the spatial patterns derived from the eDNA data and those derived from the traditional monitoring data. Moreover, using the eDNA data, analysis of endemicity revealed the majority of OTUs and species occurred only at a single wetland or wetland complex. Few genera were shared between the traditional survey data set and the molecular data sets. But for those that were shared, detectability varied between gene fragments and among genera, ranging from 11 to 100% in the trnL data to 14.3-100% in the 18S data. Our results show that landscape patterns in plant communities can be reliably derived from eDNA analysis, thus providing a cost-effective way of undertaking vegetation surveys. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - We present a hierarchical model developed for assessing the climate vulnerability and impact on the urban system to heat wave and pluvial flooding phenomena, which allows measuring the "urban performances" under extreme climate conditions by applying physical, environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The model is structured in five levels, from the knowledge of heterogeneous urban characteristics extracted from different sources to the vulnerability indicators; each level provides a synthesis of the information of the previous level. Moreover, given the complexity of the urban system, the model is based on the identification of three subsystems, in order to gradually synthesize information from one level to another. Each indicator, and the associated data and characteristics, are related to a specific subsystem, which represents technological/environmental (building, open spaces) or socioeconomic dimension (population). Finally, we assess the impacts related to a climate hazard scenario by evaluating the combination of the hazard with the exposure and the vulnerability of the subsystems with which the exposure interacts. We test our method on the study area of East Naples (Italy) by considering heat wave and pluvial flooding climate hazard scenarios; specific functions are performed in a GIS environment to implement the spatial analysis processes need to build the vulnerability indicators and impact scenarios. The results show that the distribution of vulnerability and impacts are related to the local urban context and to the hazard scenario considered. The proposed model can be applied to assess the benefits of adaptive solution design.

AB  - The study was carried out with 17 bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes in 7 different environments under rain-fed conditions of the Thrace region in Turkey during 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 growing seasons. Value for cultivation and use (VCU) trial data on yield and quality traits (1000-kernel weight, test weight, protein content, Zeleny sedimentation and alveograph energy value) of bread wheat genotypes were assessed through GGE-biplot analysis. Variance analysis revealed significant genotype (G) x environment (E) interaction (GET). GGE-biplot analysis explained 79.18% of total variation. Environment-focused assessments revealed 3 mega-environments (ME). E7 (Luleburgaz-2016) was identified as the best representative of all environments and had the greatest separation power among the genotypes. According to the average environment coordinate (AEC), of the genotypes with high PC1 (Principal component) scores, the ones with a PC2 score close to 0.0 were identified as the most stable genotypes. G15, G14, G10 and G13 were the closest genotypes to AEC apsis and they had high PC1 scores. Biplot graphs were generated for 5 quality traits and stabilities of genotypes were put forth based on their positions with respect to AEC. In VCU trials, 5 control cultivars were also used and the average of control cultivars (AC) was generated. AC -focused comparisons of the genotypes were performed. It was concluded based on the present findings that GGE-biplot analysis facilitated the assessments of VCU trial data on yield and quality traits.

AB  - Indoor Localization and Tracking have become an attractive research topic because of the wide range of potential applications. These applications are highly demanding in terms of estimation accuracy and rise a challenge due to the complexity of the scenarios modeled. Approaches for these topics are mainly based on either deterministic or probabilistic methods, such as Kalman or Particles Filter. These techniques are improved by fusing information from different sources, such as wireless or optical sensors. In this paper, a novel MUlti-sensor Fusion using adaptive fingerprint (MUFAF) algorithm is presented and compared with several multi-sensor indoor localization and tracking methods. MUFAF is mainly divided in four phases: first, a target position estimation (TPE) process is performed by every sensor; second, a target tracking process stage; third, a multi-sensor fusion combines the sensor information; and finally, an adaptive fingerprint update (AFU) is applied. For TPE, a complete environment characterization in combination with a Kernel density estimation technique is employed to obtain object position. A Modified Kalman Filter is applied to TPE output in order to smooth target routes and avoid outliers effect. Moreover, two fusion methods are described in this paper: track-to-track fusion and Kalman sensor group fusion. Finally, AFU will endow the algorithm with responsiveness to environment changes by using Kriging interpolation to update the scenario fingerprint. MUFAF is implemented and compared in a test bed showing that it provides a significant improvement in estimation accuracy and long-term adaptivity to condition changes.

AB  - Macroautophagy is a specific variant of autophagy that involves a dedicated doublemembraned organelle commonly known as autophagosome. Various methods have been developed to quantify the size of the autophagosomal compartment, which is an indirect indicator of macroautophagic responses, based on the peculiar ability of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B; best known as LC3) to accumulate in forming autophagosomes upon maturation. One particularly convenient method to monitor the accumulation of mature LC3 within autophagosomes relies on a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged variant of this protein and fluorescence microscopy. In physiological conditions, cells transfected temporarily or stably with a GFP-LC3-encoding construct exhibit a diffuse green fluorescence over the cytoplasm and nucleus. Conversely, in response to macroautophagy-promoting stimuli, the GFP-LC3 signal becomes punctate and often (but not always) predominantly cytoplasmic. The accumulation of GFP-LC3 in cytoplasmic dots, however, also ensues the blockage of any of the steps that ensure the degradation of mature autophagosomes, calling for the implementation of strategies that accurately discriminate between an increase in autophagic flux and an arrest in autophagic degradation. Various cell lines have been engineered to stably express GFP-LC3, which-combined with the appropriate controls of flux, high-throughput imaging stations, and automated image analysis-offer a relatively straightforward tool to screen large chemical or biological libraries for inducers or inhibitors of autophagy. Here, we describe a simple and robust method for the high-throughput quantification of GFP-LC3(+) dots by automated fluorescence microscopy.

AB  - The present work investigates the occurrence of 22 drugs of abuse (DAs) and metabolites in surface water from four Spanish River basins: Llobregat, Ebro, Jucar and Guadalquivir. To this end, samples were collected from 77 selected sites in two sampling campaigns conducted in 2010 and 2011. Analyses were performed by means of on-line solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS). Cocaine, its metabolite benzoylecgonine, ephedrine, MDMA (ecstasy), and methadone and its metabolite EDDP were the most ubiquitous compounds, being present in more than 50% of the samples. Overall, DAs were present at low ng/L levels, showing comparatively higher concentrations in small tributary rivers impacted by wastewater treatment plant effluents. The results obtained did not show a clear relationship between the concentrations of DAs and the hydrological conditions of the river basins. Differences in the occurrence of DAs between river basins were observed, but only for MDMA this finding could be confirmed in both sampling campaigns. These results overall suggest similar drugs consumption in the studied areas. Estimation of,potential ecotoxicological effects using Hazard Quotient (HQ) ratios and a concentration addition model showed that in four samples the presence of DAs could represent certain risk to aquatic organisms.

AB  - Genetic diversity provides insight into heterogeneous demographic and adaptive history across organisms' distribution ranges. For this reason, decomposing single species into genetic units may represent a powerful tool to better understand biogeographical patterns as well as improve predictions of the effects of GCC (global climate change) on biodiversity loss. Using 279 georeferenced Iberian accessions, we used classes of three intraspecific genetic units of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana obtained from the genetic analyses of nuclear SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), chloroplast SNPs, and the vernalization requirement for flowering. We used SDM (species distribution models), including climate, vegetation, and soil data, at the whole-species and genetic-unit levels. We compared model outputs for present environmental conditions and with a particularly severe GCC scenario. SDM accuracy was high for genetic units with smaller distribution ranges. Kernel density plots identified the environmental variables underpinning potential distribution ranges of genetic units. Combinations of environmental variables accounted for potential distribution ranges of genetic units, which shrank dramatically with GCC at almost all levels. Only two genetic clusters increased their potential distribution ranges with GCC. The application of SDM to intraspecific genetic units provides a detailed picture on the biogeographical patterns of distinct genetic groups based on different genetic criteria. Our approach also allowed us to pinpoint the genetic changes, in terms of genetic background and physiological requirements for flowering, that Iberian A.thaliana may experience with a GCC scenario applying SDM to intraspecific genetic units.

AB  - A high sensitivity analytical method for Np-237 analysis was developed and applied to groundwater samples from the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) using short-lived Np-239 as a yield tracer and HR magnetic sector ICP-MS. The Np-237 concentrations in the vicinity of the Almendro, Cambric, Dalhart, Cheshire, and Chancellor underground nuclear test locations range from <4 x 10(-4) to 2.6 mBq/L (6 x 10(-17)-4.2 x 10(-13) mol/L). All measured Np-237 concentrations are well below the drinking water maximum contaminant level for alpha emitters identified by the U.S. EPA (560 mBq/L). Nevertheless, Np-237 remains an important indicator for radionuclide transport rates at the NNSS. Retardation factor ratios were used to compare the mobility of Np-237 to that of other radionuclides. The results suggest that Np-237 is less mobile than tritium and other non-sorbing radionuclides (C-14, (CI)-C-36, Tc-99 and I-129) as expected. Surprisingly, Np-237 and plutonium (Pu-239,Pu-249) retardation factors are very similar. It is possible that Np(IV) exists under mildly reducing groundwater conditions and exhibits a retardation behavior that is comparable to Pu(IV). Independent of the underlying process, Np-237 is migrating downgradient from NNSS underground nuclear tests at very low but measureable concentrations. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - This article reviews the application of ecohydrological indicators to hydrogeological conceptual models for earth-scientists with little or no botanical training. Ecohydrological indicators are plants whose presence or morphology can provide data about the hydrogeological setting. By examining the literature from the fields of ecohydrology, hydrogeology, geobotany, and ecology, this article summarizes what is known about groundwater indicator plants, their potential for providing information about the aquifer, and how this data can be a cost-effective addition to hydrogeological conceptual models. We conclude that the distribution and morphology of ecohydrological groundwater indicator plants can be useful to hydrogeologists in certain circumstances. They are easiest to evaluate in arid and semiarid climates. Ecohydrological groundwater indicators can provide information about the absolute depth to the water table, patterns of groundwater fluctuation, and the mineralization of the aquifer. It is shown that an understanding of the meteorological conditions of a region is often necessary to accurately interpret groundwater indicator plants and that useful data is usually obtained by observing patterns of vegetation behavior rather than interpreting individual plants. The most serious limitations to applying this source of information to hydrogeological conceptual models are the limited data in the literature and the regional nature of many indicator plants. The physical and physiological indications of the plants exist, but little effort has been made to interpret them. This article concludes by outlining several potential lines of research that could further the usefulness of ecohydrological groundwater indicators to the hydrogeological community.

AB  - Identification of genetic control of salt tolerance at the growth stage provides useful information for constructing breeding programs for wheat. Inheritance of salinity tolerance was studied in a cross between 'Tabasi' (P1) a tolerant and 'Ghods' (P2) a susceptible bread wheat (T. aestivum) cultivar, F-1, F-2 and backcross generations (BC1 and BC2) under saline conditions (EC=14 dS m(-1)) in a greenhouse. Eight characters were recorded: biological dry weight (DW), heading date (HD), plant height (PH), K+ concentration (K+), Na+ concentration (Na+), K+/Na+ ratios, total number of tillers per plant (NT) and ratio of fertile tillers per total tillers in each plant (RFT). Generation mean analysis of these traits revealed the involvement of additive and non-additive type gene effects in controlling most of the traits. The epistatic effects [i] for DW, Na+, K+/Na+ and PH, [j] for DW and PH, [1] for DW, Na+, K+/Na+, NT, PH and HD were significant. Additive [d] effects were significant for all measured traits and dominance [h] effects were significant for all except K+ and RFT. High narrow sense heritability (0.60) was estimated for K+/Na, indicating this may be used as a useful indicator index for the selection of salt tolerant genotypes at the vegetative growth stage in wheat. In consideration of demonstrable additive and non-additive effects in controlling measured traits, recurrent selection followed by pedigree breeding may prove useful in improving salinity tolerance in vegetative stage wheat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of transgenic soybean (Glycine max, L.) varieties resistant to glyphosate (GR soybeans) has rapidly expanded in Argentina, increasing pesticide use where only grasslands were previously cultivated. The authors compared an estimate of environmental risk for different crops and active ingredients using the IPEST index, which is based on a fuzzy-logic expert system. For IPEST calculations, four modules are defined, one reflecting the rate of application, the other three reflecting the risk for groundwater, surface water and air. The input variables are pesticide properties, site-specific conditions and characteristics of the pesticide application. The expert system calculates the value of modules according to the degree of membership of the input variables to the fuzzy subsets F (favourable) and U (unfavourable), and they can be aggregated following sets of decision rules. IPEST integrated values of >= 7 reflect low environmental risk, and values of <7 reflect high risk.
   RESULTS: Alfalfa, soybean and wheat showed IPEST values over 7 (low risk), while maize had the lowest IPEST values (high risk). Comparing active ingredients applied in annual and perennial crops, atrazine and acetochlor gave the highest risks of environmental contamination, and they are mainly used in maize. Groundwater was the most affected compartment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fuzzy logic provided an easy tool combining different environmental components with pesticide properties to give a simple and accessible risk assessment. These findings provide information about active ingredients that should be replaced in order to protect water and air from pesticide contamination. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Zooxanthellae fluorescence was measured in situ, remotely, and in near real-time with a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer for a colony of Siderastrea siderea and Agaricia tenuifolia at Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas during the Caribbean-wide 2005 bleaching event. These colonies displayed evidence of photosystem II (PS II) inactivation coincident with thermal stress and seasonally high doses of solar radiation. Hurricane-associated declines in temperature and light appear to have facilitated the recovery of maximum quantum yield of PS II within these two colonies, although both corals responded differently to individual storms. PAM fluorometry, coupled with long-term measurement of in situ light and temperature, provides much more detail of coral photobiology on a seasonal time scale and during possible bleaching conditions than sporadic, subjective, and qualitative observations. S. siderea displayed evidence of PS II inactivation over a month prior to the issuing of a satellite-based, sea surface temperature (SST) bleaching alert by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In fact, recovery had already begun in S. siderea when the bleaching alert was issued. Fluorescence data for A. tenuifolia were difficult to interpret because the shaded parts of a colony were monitored and thus did not perfectly coincide with thermal stress and seasonally high doses of solar radiation as in S. siderea. These results further emphasize the limitations of solely monitoring SST (satellite or in situ) as a bleaching indicator without considering the physiological status of coral-zooxanthellae symbioses.

AB  - Stator fault is one of the most commonly occurring faults in ac machines. Recent estimates suggest that 30%-40% of all reported induction machine faults are stator fault related. Going by the number of occurrences, the position of stator faults is only second to bearing-related faults. Third harmonic line currents, which are caused by the interaction of a reverse-rotating field and saturation-related permeance variation, the third harmonic component in the line voltage, and the speed ripple consequent to the reverse-rotating field, have been reported to increase under stator fault conditions. Since the reverse-rotating field is produced by voltage unbalance as well as stator faults the measurement of third harmonic in the line current may not be a reliable estimator of stator faults, particularly at an incipient stage. The third and the other triplen-related harmonics are however found to be a very decisive indicator of the fault if measured in the machine terminal voltages just after switch-off. The fault-detection technique is independent of machine parameters and supply unbalances. Simulation and experimental results with very few shorted turns show that not only the presence of stator fault but also the phase in which the fault has occurred can be detected reliably. However, because of the nature of detection, it should strictly be called an offline method that can only validate existing online schemes, unless used for motors operating continuously in transient modes or form-wound machines.

AB  - Siberian rivers are of global importance as they impact on the freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean, which affects the Thermo-Haline circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean. Siberian rivers, in particular the tributaries to the larger rivers, are under-represented in the international river-regime databases. The runoff of three Russian rivers in the Central Siberian taiga (Kureyka, Karabula and Erba) is modelled to analyse the relative influence of climate. In addition three rivers (Rhine, Maas and Odra) in Western Europe are similarly assessed as a control. The results show that the role of precipitation and autocorrelation as factors in the formation of river runoff is stronger under oceanic climate conditions, increasing from the central regions of Northern Eurasia towards the Arctic Ocean in the North and the Atlantic in the West. At the same time the influence of summer temperatures is weakened. The formation of Northern Eurasian river runoff appears to be influenced by periodically thawing top horizons of permafrost soil. Time served as an indicator for land use change after inclusion of meteorological data in the models. Maas and Erba showed a significant influence of the time factor. For the Erba the onset of agricultural land use in the catchment coincides with a drop in runoff. A similar causal relationship is suggested for the Maas. Land use can change the formation of runoff, which in turn can be used as an environmental indicator for sustainable land use. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sediments of palaeolakes located in eastern Poland represent the Holsteinian Interglacial and the initial part of the succeeding Saalian Glaciation. They consist of 55 m thick lake marl and calcareous gyttja deposits. Reconstruction of climate during this part of the Pleistocene was carried out by the analyses of oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of carbonates, palynological data, Al and Ca content of sediments.
   Isotope ratios and palynological results give in some cases contradictory results. delta(18)O ratios from Lake Ossowka (eastern Poland) indicate relatively cool conditions at the climatic optimum of the Holsteinian Interglacial. Low ratios may have been caused by increased precipitation that led to high stands of the lake level. During the initial stages of the following glaciation, the delta(18)O and delta(13)C ratios increased, probably resulting from low water level and strong evaporation in cool and dry climate phases. Additionally, high Al contents indicate high allochthonous siliciclastic input. High Ca concentrations indicate autochthonous carbonate precipitation from the lake epilimnion.
   The combined climate indicators for the Holsteinian Interglacial in eastern Poland suggest that this temperate episode corresponds to Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11) of the North Atlantic.
   Comparison of the continental record from eastern Poland with the marine record from the North Atlantic separated by about 2500 km indicates that even small climatic changes can be identified in genetically different deposits, documenting the global nature of Pleistocene climate trends.

AB  - A survey of soil erosion was conducted in Australia using the fallout radioisotope caesium-137 as an indicator of topsoil redistribution. Two hundred and six sites were sampled, 100 within rotational cropping and horticultural use, 52 within uncultivated permanent pasture and forest, and 54 in rangelands. Average net soil losses were approximately equal for cultivated cropping lands and rangelands (ca. 5.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), and just over 1 t ha(-1) yr(-1) for pasture and forest. The Mann Whitney U Test revealed that losses under cropping and rangeland conditions were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than under uncultivated pasture and forest. Soil loss was negatively correlated with mean annual rainfall and slope gradient, and positively correlated with slope length (Spearman's rank correlation). There was no correlation between rates of soil loss and a rainfall erosivity index. An assessment of erosional events was provided by landholders for 104 sites, with their ranking being weakly but significantly correlated with soil loss estimates (r = +0.35). Sixty percent of sites had net soil losses greater than 1 t ha(-1) yr(-1), and 74% of sites had losses of more than 0.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1). This latter rate may be regarded as a limit for a tolerable level of soil loss. These high rates of soil loss have occurred since the mid-1950s despite there being significant landholder awareness of the soil erosion hazard.

AB  - The aim of the article is to analyse the effect of agricultural landscape pattern in collectivisation on its properties and functioning and also to try to assess the relevance of the phenomenon from the point of view of sustainability criteria. The negative and limited view of the effect of collectivisation on functioning of the landscape prevails among experts. The presented interpretation of the collectivisation process is wider and includes such aspects as for instance forestation or grassing of the previously worked small fields on steep slopes, reduction of the field road network, removal or ploughing away of other line forms, etc. Based on the analysis of the effect of the collectivised agricultural landscape pattern on landscape components, the idea of its sustainable form is formulated. Comparison of harmony or disharmony of the two agricultural landscape patterns with the sustainable forms was made by means of indicators representing the effects of agricultural landscape patterns on the individual landscape components with (+) and (-) signs aligned and summed, which expressed their harmony or disharmony with the idea of sustainable agriculture (Table 1). Scores of the (+) and (-) values showed that the pre-collectivisation pattern was generally more favourable from the sustainability point of view. Closer analysis though, showed that some measures connected with collectivisation were positive for one landscape component and prevailingly negative for other. Consequently, the assessment of the collectivisation from the point of view of the rate of harmony of the agricultural landscape pattern with the principles of sustainable agriculture requires consideration and assessment of the particular conditions of the studied territory.

AB  - Carotenoid-based sexual coloration is the classic example of an honest signal of mate quality Animals cannot synthesize carotenoid pigments and ultimately depend on dietary sources. Thus, in carotenoid-poor environments, carotenoid coloration may be a direct indicator of foraging ability and an indirect indicator of health and vigour. Carotenoid coloration may also be affected, more directly, by parasites in some species. Carotenoids are not, however:, the only conspicuous pigments available to animals. Pteridine pigments, with similar spectral properties, are displayed in the exoskeletons and wings of insects, the irides of birds and the skins of fishes, lizards and amphibians. Unlike carotenoids, pteridines are synthesized de novo by animals. We report that the orange spots that male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) display to females contain red pteridine pigments (drosopterins) in addition to carotenoids. We also examined the relationship between drosopterin production by males and carotenoid availability in the field. The results contrasted sharply with the hypothesis that males use drosopterins to compensate for carotenoid scarcity: males used more, not less, drosopterins in streams with higher carotenoid availability The positive association between drosopterin use and carotenoid availability could reflect the costs of drosopterin synthesis or it could be a consequence of females preferring a particular pigment ratio or hue. Male guppies appear to use drosopterin pigments in a manner that dilutes, but does not eliminate, the indicator value of carotenoid coloration.

AB  - Enterococci are useful indicators of faecal contamination with their high abundance in faeces and long survival in the environment and the possibility of indicating the source of contamination by species identification has lead to discussion of whether enterococci would be more reliable faecal indicators than E. coli. In an attempt to facilitate rapid and accurate identification of enterococci, 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed by computer-aided analysis of more than 4,000 rRNA sequences. Probes were labelled non-isotopically with digoxigenin and fluorescent dyes. Conditions for specific hybridisation were optimised for dot blot hybridisation and whole cell hybridisation for all probes. With a combination of two probes, all hygienically important enterococci could be detected and 24 biochemically identified environmental isolates also hybridised with one of these probes. A quantitative detection method with a high sensitivity was developed based on filtration of water samples through polycarbonate filters, a short incubation on agar and microcolony filter hybridisation with fluorescently labelled probes followed by epifluorescence microscopy. Within 8-20h sampling a specific identification of enterococcal microcolonies was possible. With this method 15/32 well- and tap-water sources from the Mainz area were identified as being of substandard quality. The proposed method detects faecal contamination significantly earlier than conventional methods and could be helpful in the hygienic monitoring of drinking water. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

AB  - Eight mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) cultivars were evaluated for their tolerance to different levels of chromium (Cr+6) (0, 24, 48, 96, 192, and 384 mu M) in nutrient solutions at pH 6.8. Seeds were germinated and grown in the presence of chromium under controlled environmental conditions. Standard growth parameters such as root length, shoot length, root/shoot dry matter production, and root/shoot tolerance index were used as indicators of chromium toxicity. Measurements as early as 24 h after the beginning of the treatments did not yield consistent results. However, root measurements at 48, 72, and 96 h after the beginning of treatments yielded significant differences among the cultivars which were similar to field performance observations made for mungbean growing in chromium-rich soils. The cultivars, TARM-22 and K-851 had enhanced root growth while PDM-54, Sujata, TARM-21, LGG-407, and PDM-116 showed a reverse trend in root growth in the presence of chromium. The root tolerance index (RTI) and the shoot tolerance index (STI) with respect to the cultivars TARM-22 and K-851 were high indicating their tolerance to chromium, while the cultivars PDM-54 and Sujata showed a low RTI and STI. Based on the growth parameters of the eight mungbean cultivars, they were ranked with respect of their tolerance to chromium as follows: TARM-22>K-851>Dhauli>PDM-116>LGG-407>TARM-21> Sujata>PDM-54. Therefore, the nutrient culture method was able to quickly screen the mungbean cultivars for their tolerance to chromium.

AB  - Purpose Recognizing the factors affecting employees' job motivation is one of the necessities that can improve people's performance and increase their effectiveness. This study aims to determine the factors affecting job motivation and to examine effective strategies to increase motivation through identifying internal and external factors. Design/methodology/approach In this descriptive study, the statistical population was the employees of the largest petrochemical company in Iran. The questionnaire was randomly distributed to the organization's employees and managers based on Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory. To analyze the obtained data, first, the best and the worst factors were identified using SPSS software and then were ranked using best-worst method (BWM). Findings The results demonstrated that the highest rank among the motivational factors of employees is related to working environment conditions and the lowest rank is related to career advancement and development indicator. In the second stage, the best strategies for motivational factors were determined using the fuzzy goal programming method. The findings showed that 12 out of the 17 proposed solutions have the highest motivation among employees, the implementation of which can increase employee productivity in the petrochemical company under study. Originality/value Further to the best of the authors' knowledge, job motivation factors in the petrochemical industry have never been examined and ranked by using the BWM method so far. Also, the goal programming approach has never been applied to determine strategies for increasing job motivation and ultimately productivity.

AB  - Traditional radar target detection algorithms are mostly based on statistical theory. They have weak generalization capabilities for complex sea clutter environments and diverse target characteristics, and their detection performance would be significantly reduced. In this paper, the range-azimuth-frame information obtained by scanning radar is converted into plain position indicator (PPI) images, and a novel Radar-PPInet is proposed and used for marine target detection. The model includes CSPDarknet53, SPP, PANet, power non-maximum suppression (P-NMS), and multi-frame fusion section. The prediction frame coordinates, target category, and corresponding confidence are directly given through the feature extraction network. The network structure strengthens the receptive field and attention distribution structure, and further improves the efficiency of network training. P-NMS can effectively improve the problem of missed detection of multi-targets. Moreover, the false alarms caused by strong sea clutter are reduced by the multi-frame fusion, which is also a benefit for weak target detection. The verification using the X-band navigation radar PPI image dataset shows that compared with the traditional cell-average constant false alarm rate detector (CA-CFAR) and the two-stage Faster R-CNN algorithm, the proposed method significantly improved the detection probability by 15% and 10% under certain false alarm probability conditions, which is more suitable for various environment and target characteristics. Moreover, the computational burden is discussed showing that the Radar-PPInet detection model is significantly lower than the Faster R-CNN in terms of parameters and calculations.

AB  - The occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is increasing in frequency and intensity in South African estuaries because of eutrophication. This study used DNA metabarcoding to identify the benthic diatom community structure in the eutrophic Sundays Estuary. The recurrent HAB phytoplankton species Heterosigma akashiwo was recorded at bloom concentrations (similar to 100 mu g Chl a l(-1)) in the brackish, vertically stratified middle reaches of the estuary. In contrast, microphytobenthos biomass increased towards the upper reaches in response to elevated availability of total oxidised nitrogen (NOx) and increased sediment stability. A total of 76 diatom species were identified using the molecular technique. Seven known nutrient-tolerant diatom species indicate a preference for either ammonium or NOx enrichment. Benthic diatom community diversity (H ' < 1) and evenness (J ' < 0.25) were low in the brackish middle reaches of the estuary, where the HABs decreased available light. Heterosigma akashiwo has been found in previous studies to suppress the growth of co-occurring taxa. Future research efforts should focus on verifying this relationship over seasonal timescales given the dominance of H. akashiwo in spring/summer. As the persistently nutrient-enriched state and stable flow conditions of the Sundays Estuary is the key driver of change, management efforts should be geared towards re-establishing the estuary's natural flow variations and to measures that can mitigate nutrient pollution.

AB  - Parasite and pathogen incidence and prevalence is driven by both periodic variation in environmental conditions and host characteristics. Given the increasing risk of zoonotic transmission to humans, and the close phylogenetic relationship between humans and non-human primates, understanding this variation in parasite dynamics is becoming essential for epidemiologists and conservationists alike. The extreme seasonal temperatures coupled with declining annual rainfall and severe periodic drought of the semi-arid Karoo poses distinct challenges to both hosts and pathogens and serves as a window into how animals confront climate change-induced environmental changes. Here we quantified annual variation in gastrointestinal parasite prevalence, intensity and richness in three troops of wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and determined what climatic variables were driving these changes. Further, we assessed whether there is long-term temporal dependence in intra-individual faecal egg counts. We found variation in the prevalence of five genera of helminths identified in the study population, but little variation in parasite richness across the year. Such variation was driven primarily by precipitation and maximum daily temperature. Finally, we found structure in faecal egg counts, suggesting that contrary to previous findings, egg shedding of Trichostrongylus sp. and ?Protospirura sp. are not stochastic processes and may serve as an indicator of individual levels of infection in our population. Combined, these results provide the first report of seasonal effects in gastrointestinal parasites of vervet monkeys living in an extreme environment.

AB  - This work studies the changes in delta N-15 signature during the composting of sewage sludge (MS) and agri-food sludge (AS) with different bulking agents and the potential relationships between the changes in this parameter with both the source of the organic matter used as a raw material and the stability of the end-materials obtained. For this, eleven mixtures were prepared in commercial composting conditions using sewage sludge from municipal wastewater in a range of 60-85% (on a fresh weight basis) or agri-food sludge in a range of 65-75%, mixed with seven different pruning wastes as bulking agents. The thermal profile was monitored throughout the composting processes, and the main physico-chemical and chemical parameters were determined. The results obtained confirmed a correct development of the composting processes, observing slight differences in process evolution depending on the type of sludge used. The composts obtained showed adequate contents of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) and reached a good degree of maturity. Significant differences in the specific nitrogen isotopic composition were found in the initial materials. Moreover, the results suggest that the type of sludge had a main contribution in the delta N-15 value of the initial composting mixtures. The use of delta N-15 is recommended as an indicator of the composting process, especially to evaluate N dynamics, and the quality of the resultant compost.

AB  - Automated recording units (ARUs) are an integral instrument in a broad range of applications such as invasive species management, behavioural studies, and environmental impact assessments. They have become particularly important in conservation programmes for a range of cryptic threatened bird species. While the fundamental issues of signal attenuation and degradation are well known, understanding how environmental factors influence detectability of calls on ARU recordings in particular circumstances is essential for the accurate interpretation of their results. Using five transects spaced at equal angles running from a central playback source we tested the detectability ofPezoporus flaviventris(Western Ground Parrot) andAtrichornis clamosus(Noisy Scrub-bird) calls on Wildlife Acoustics SM2 and SM4 devices. Both species call from on or near the ground in moderately dense heathlands. Detectability of calls was affected by wind direction: fewer calls were detected on an ARU that was up-wind of the broadcast source compared with another on a down-wind unit. More calls were detected on ARUs deployed at higher relative elevation, and detectability decreased with increased distance from the playback source. Calls were detected at a greater distance from the playback source when using SM4 ARUs, compared to SM2 ARUs. Inconsistency in the detection of bird calls through space and time could lead to errors in metrics calculated from acoustic data. Further investigation is required to determine how environmental factors such as wind direction can be accounted for in data analysis.

AB  - Resilience indicators are a convenient tool to assess the resilience of engineering systems. They are often used in preliminary designs or in the assessment of complex systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to assess the time-dependent resilience of engineering systems using resilience indicators. A Bayesian network (BN) approach is employed to handle the relationships among the indicators. BN is known for its capability of handling causal dependencies between different variables in probabilistic terms. However, the use of BN is limited to static systems that are in a state of equilibrium. Being at equilibrium is often not the case because most engineering systems are dynamic in nature as their performance fluctuates with time, especially after disturbing events (e.g. natural disasters). Therefore, the temporal dimension is tackled in this work using the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). DBN extends the classical BN by adding the time dimension. It permits the interaction among variables at different time steps. It can be used to track the evolution of a system's performance given an evidence recorded at a previous time step. This allows predicting the resilience state of a system given its initial condition. A mathematical probabilistic framework based on the DBN is developed to model the resilience of dynamic engineering systems. Two illustrative examples are presented in the paper to demonstrate the applicability of the introduced framework. One example evaluates the resilience of Brazil. The other one evaluates the resilience of a transportation system.

AB  - Palaeogeographic markers can be justified among a large number of geochemical indicators in separate layers of pedosediments. This determines the need to develop a system of most information-rich pedogenetic indicators for reconstruction of the dynamics of erosion-accumulative processes based on dated earthen defensive constructions of the historical period. We demonstrated this solution at the example of a frontier rampart with a ditch of the mid-17th century ("Catena linking of landscape-geochemical processes and reconstruction of pedosedimentogenesis: a case study of defensive constructions of the mid-17th century, South Russia" [1]). Using individual of macroelements and trace elements as part of complex geochemical relationships and indicators allows us to determine the geochemical associations of elements that diagnose migration of the sediments at the trans-eluvial catenas. It is shown that in the forest-steppe conditions the determined system of pedogenic indicators, such as content of particles (%) with the size >0.01 and < 0.005 mm, pH(H2O), CO2, (CaO+MgO):Al2O3, Si:Al, CaO:TiO2, the eluviation coefficient, the association of mobile (Ca, Na, Mg, Sr) and weakly mobile (K, Ba, Rb) elements, the sum of the elements accumulated in the soil (P, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Cu). They can be the basis of this classification and chronostratigraphy of pedosediments. The data obtained in these investigations are aimed at the establishment of soil-geomorphologic interrelations and calibration of mathematical models of natural processes. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Warming climate is thawing the permafrost in arctic and subarctic regions, leading to formation of thermokarst ponds. During the formation and geomorphological succession of these ponds, carbon that has been trapped in frozen soils for thousands of years is hydrologically mobilized and returned to the active carbon cycle. We sampled 12 thermokarst ponds representing three different stages of pond succession to study the potential of microbial communities to metabolize the organic carbon in the water. We investigated the quality of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water column based on the spectrophotometric and fluorometric properties of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter combined with parallel factor analysis and the potential of the microbial community for degrading these carbon compounds based on genetic markers related to carbon degradation. Our analysis showed a clear difference in the DOC quality across the different developmental stages. In the younger ponds, organic matter quality suggested that it was originating from the degrading permafrost and in the metagenomes collected from these ponds, the normalized abundance of genes related to degradation of carbon compounds was higher. There was also a shift in the degradation potential in the water column of the ponds, with higher potential for organic matter degradation in deeper, anoxic layers. In conclusion, our results show that the DOC quality and the genetic potential of the microbial community for carbon cycling change across the pond ontogeny, suggesting a capacity of the microbial communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Changes in meteorological patterns to drier conditions alter the hydrodynamic processes of reservoirs and can affect their thermal structure. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of a severe drought period on the hydrodynamics of a tropical reservoir. One-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling was applied from 2009 to 2016 to simulate the thermal dynamics of the highly drought-impacted Serra Azul reservoir, a drinking water supply reservoir located in southeast Brazil. After calibration (r = 0.91, root mean square error [RMSE] = 1.33 degrees C) and validation of the model (r = 0.87, RMSE = 2.06 degrees C), physical indicators were calculated to evaluate the stratification and mixing processes in the water column. Results showed that the reservoir hydrodynamics were affected by the drought period through an increase in mixing frequency and duration. Negative implications for water quality are expected, such as higher concentration of dissolved substances and nutrients and increased turbidity, salinity, and electrical conductivity, as observed in most lakes and reservoirs subjected to drought. Different water withdrawal scenarios were simulated, and a critical water withdrawal volume that could prevent drought impacts on the Serra Azul reservoir thermal regime was identified. This study indicates the need for managers to understand potential impacts of extreme meteorological events in reservoir dynamics, particularly when the reservoirs are part of drinking water systems.

AB  - Because carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNMs) are expected to enter soils, the exposure implications to crop plants and plant-microbe interactions should be understood. Most investigations have been under ideal growth conditions, yet crops commonly experience abiotic and biotic stresses. Little is known how co-exposure to these environmental stresses and CNMs would cause combined effects on plants. We investigated the effects of 1000 mg kg(-1) multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and industrial carbon black (CB) on soybeans grown to the bean production stage in soil. Following seed sowing, plants became stressed by heat and infested with an insect (thrips). Consequently, all plants had similarly stunted growth, leaf damage, reduced final biomasses and fewer root nodules compared with healthy control soybeans previously grown without heat and thrips stresses. Thus, CNMs did not significantly influence the growth and yield of stressed soybeans, and the previously reported nodulation inhibition by CNMs was not specifically observed here. However, CNMs did significantly alter two leaf health indicators: the leaf chlorophyll a/b ratio, which was higher in the GNP treatment than in either the control (by 15%) or CB treatment (by 14%), and leaf lipid peroxidation, which was elevated in the CNT treatment compared with either the control (by 47 %) or GNP treatment (by 66 %). Overall, these results show that, while severe environmental stresses may impair plant production, CNMs (including CNTs and GNPs) in soil could additionally affect foliar health of an agriculturally important legume.

AB  - The previous part of this article starts 100 years ago, at the time of the humble beginnings of building science, and brings us to the current stage of the net zero energy buildings (NZEB). We see how, over the years, knowledge from the observed failures of buildings has accumulated to become the basis for current building science. The strong interactions between energy efficiency, moisture management, and indoor environment and the need for their simultaneous analysis led to the concept of environmental assessment. More than 40 years of experience with passive houses (the first 10 were built in Canada in 1977) in process that would collect those developments into the mainstream of NZEB technology permits extrapolation to the future. As the first priority, we see a need for a fundamental change in the approach to NZEB-instead of improving the separate pieces of the puzzle before assembling them, we need first to establish the conceptual design of the whole system. Only after determination of the basic requirements for each subsystem and each assembly may materials that would fulfill the specific requirements of this assembly be selected. In this design process, the actual climate and socio-economic conditions (including construction cost) vary, so we must deal with a set of design principles rather than a description of a specific construction technology. A guiding set of considerations is presented below to establish a system of environmental quality management (EQM).

AB  - Background: The reduction of tetrazolium salts by NAD(P)H to formazan product has been widely used to determine the metabolic activity of cells, and as an indicator of cell viability. However, the application of a WST-8 based assay for the quantitative measurement of dehydrogenase enzyme activity has not been described before. In this study, we reported the application of an assay based on the tetrazolium salt WST-8 for the quantitative measurement of dehydrogenase activity. The assay is performed in a microplate format, where a single endpoint is measured at 450 nm.
   Results: The optimized dehydrogenase-WST-8 assay conditions, the limit of detection (LOD), accuracy, and precision for measuring NAD(P)H, were demonstrated. The sensitivity of the WST-8 assay for detecting NAD(P)H was 5-fold greater than the spectrophotometric measurement of NAD(P)H absorption at 340 nm (LOD of 0.3 nmole vs 1.7 nmole, respectively). In the dehydrogenase assay, the colorimetric WST-8 method exhibits excellent assay reproducibility with a Z' factor of 0.9. The WST-8 assay was also used to determine dehydrogenase activity in biological samples, and for screening the substrate of uncharacterized short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the WST-8 assay is a sensitive and rapid method for determining NAD(P)H concentration and dehydrogenase enzyme activity, which can be further applied for the high-throughput screening of dehydrogenases.

AB  - When confined to a single leaf, the larvae of most leafminers should suffer intense intraspecific competition. The survival and performance of individuals are expected to decline with increasing larval density within a leaf, showing a negative density-dependent effect. The maximum density of an Elachista Treitschke (Lepidoptera: Elachistidae) miner on Indocalamus tessellatus (Munro) Keng f. (Poaceae: Bambusoideae) under natural conditions can be greater than 40 per leaf, making this a good system for studying intraspecific competition and density effects. We counted the number of leaves with different mine densities in the field and found a clumped distribution of leafminer larvae among host leaves. The emergence rates of pupae (and last-instar larvae), adults and parasitoids were inversely correlated with larval density. Pupal weight and adult weight also showed negative relationships with larval density. However, pairwise tests showed that there might be no differences in pupal or adult weight at larval densities of 1-10 mines per leaf, indicating that density-dependent effects are more obvious at densities greater than 10 mines per leaf. Intraspecific competition could lead to stable density and consistent body size in surviving individual insects, which would help maintain a sustainable population size. The density threshold could be an indicator of the balance between intraspecific competitive detriments and conspecific aggregation benefits; however, the validity of the threshold density hypothesis requires further testing and confirmation.

AB  - Ibuprofen (IBU) and its major metabolites, hydroxyibuprofen (OH-IBU) and carboxyibuprofen (CA-IBU) were monitored from November 2015 to March 2017 at four full-scale constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow treating municipal wastewater in the Czech Republic. During the seven sampling campaigns, all three compounds were identified in high concentrations in the inflowing raw wastewater. The average inflow concentrations of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU amounted to 14.6, 18.3 and 36.4 mu g l(-1). The ratio between IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU is in agreement with the previously published results indicating that the ibuprofen metabolites occur in higher concentration in the raw wastewater than the parent compound with CA-IBU exhibiting the highest concentrations. The outflow concentrations off studied compounds decreased and removal amounted to 44.7%, 29.3% and 47.5% for IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU, respectively. The results are in line with general fact that ibuprofen and its metabolites are not removed with high efficiency in anoxic or anaerobic conditions and that OH-IBU is the least removed compound. The areal loadings of IBU, OH-IBU and CA-IBU averaged 0.425, 0.574 and 0.999 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The annual loads of all forms of ibuprofen varied between 458 and 958 g year(-1) among four studies constructed wetlands.

AB  - The ubiquitous cellular labile iron pool (LIP) is often associated with the production of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, which forms through a redox reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Peroxynitrite is a biologically relevant peroxide produced by the recombination of nitric oxide and superoxide. It is a strong oxidant that may be involved in multiple pathological conditions, but whether and how it interacts with the LIP are unclear. Here, using fluorescence spectroscopy, we investigated the interaction between the LIP and peroxynitrite by monitoring peroxynitrite-dependent accumulation of nitrosated and oxidized fluorescent intracellular indicators. We found that, in murine macrophages, removal of the LIP with membrane-permeable iron chelators sustainably accelerates the peroxynitrite-dependent oxidation and nitrosation of these indicators. These observations could not be reproduced in cell-free assays, indicating that the chelator-enhancing effect on peroxynitrite-dependent modifications of the indicators depended on cell constituents, presumably including LIP, that react with these chelators. Moreover, neither free nor ferrous-complexed chelators stimulated intracellular or extracellular oxidative and nitrosative chemistries. On the basis of these results, LIP appears to be a relevant and competitive cellular target of peroxynitrite or its derived oxidants, and thereby it reduces oxidative processes, an observation that may change the conventional notion that the LIP is simply a cellular source of pro-oxidant iron.

AB  - Malaysia is currently focusing on providing affordable housing all over the country, as part of the plan to tackle the problem of the rising costs of house ownership due to reasons such as the economic crisis and land limitations. However, a limited number of methodical studies have been conducted on residents' feedback on the indoor environment of affordable housing. Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is an important aspect of occupants' wellbeing, as it affects their health and productivity. Therefore, evaluating residents' feedback on IEQ is an important step in gauging building performance and conditions. In addition, the health and productivity of residents needs to be evaluated in order to identify the effect of IEQ on them. A questionnaire survey was used to achieve the study objectives and to gain access to the respondents' views and feedback. The pilot questionnaire study was conducted at two housing apartments in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the data collected were evaluated and analyzed using SPSS software. The outcome of this pilot study is significant, as it shows the residents' dissatisfaction level towards IEQ factors such as noise, glare and privacy, and other aspects of IEQ that are important, such as ventilation. Additionally, it has been found that the IEQ of the residents does affect their health and productivity. It is anticipated that the outcome of this study will serve as an indicator of building performance improvements needed to achieve a better indoor environment quality for affordable housing in Malaysia.

AB  - Papermaking process is highly energy-intensive, complicated, and influenced by multiple unit processes, which plays an important role in the energy consumption, especially of thermal energy and electricity energy. An energy management system (EMS) was built to acquire the systematic, consistent, and accurate online information of the production process in a typical coated paperboard mill. The EMS first fulfilled the online energy information calculation from the process data acquisition and integration, second provided the massive historical data to find out the internal variation of production process for inferring decisions. In a case study, the online energy flow analysis and the estimation of specific energy consumption (SEC) were carried out. Based on data-driven techniques, three different operation conditions were recognized by adopting the kernel principal component analysis and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) when the basis weight was 220 g/m(2). The energy consumption was described in each cluster. Particular attention needed to be paid to LP steam in the high-speed production process with the change in environmental temperature and humidity in cluster 3. A novel indicator was proposed to appraise the level of energy consumption in different paper machine speeds. The benchmarking SEC was extracted from the massive historical data for the estimation of energy-saving potential. With the designed capacity of 300,000 ton/year, the potential economic benefits will be 20127 thousand RMB/year.

AB  - In recent years, the use of satellite-derived vegetation indices has become a powerful tool to collect information on vegetation dynamics in a broad range of ecosystems worldwide. However, the utility of these indices as indicators of the diet composition and quality of herbivore mammals has not yet been established. This work focuses on exploring such relationships analysing four years of records of monthly Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI, a MOD13 satellite-derived index) and diet composition and quality of two populations of chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica) in the Eastern Pyrenees (Spain). Our results revealed that 68.4% and 53.3% of diet composition and quality of chamois can be explained by EVI values in the green-up season (spring) and green senescence (winter season), respectively. In both periods, EVI was related mainly to diets low in fibre (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) and heather (Calluna vulgaris) and high in nitrogen due to the consumption of Festuca, Forbs and Trifolium. During the summer season however, the EVI was not significantly related to diet components of chamois. A significant inter-year variability in the diets of the chamois was also observed. To conclude, remote sensing is appropriate to assess temporal variations in dietary components of mountain ungulates, and could be used as a component of monitoring large herbivore populations in management programmes.

AB  - Deposition of Sahara dust (SD) particles is a frequent phenomenon in Europe, but little is known about the viability and composition of the bacterial community transported with SD. The goal of this study was to characterize SD associated bacteria transported to the European Alps, deposited and entrapped in snow. During two distinct events in February and May 2014, SD particles were deposited and promptly covered by falling snow, thus preserving them in distinct ochre layers within the snowpack. In June 2014, we collected samples at different depths from a snow profile at the Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps: 3621 m a.s.I.). After filtration, we performed various microbiological and physicochemical analyses of the snow and dust particles therein that originated in Algeria. Our results show that bacteria survive and are metabolically active after the transport to the European Alps. Using high throughput sequencing, we observed distinct differences in bacterial community composition and structure in SD-layers as compared to clean snow layers. Sporulating bacteria were not enriched in the SD-layers: however, phyla with low abundance such as Gemmatimonadetes and Deinococcus-Thermus appeared to be specific bio-indicators for SD. Since many members of these phyla are known to be adapted to arid oligotrophic environments and UV radiation, they are well suited to survive the harsh conditions of long-range airborne transport.

AB  - Diagnosing the impacts of climate change on water resources is a difficult task pertaining to the uncertainties arising from the different modelling steps. Lumped hydrological model structures contribute to this uncertainty as well as the natural climate variability, illustrated by several members from the same Global Circulation Model. In this paper, the hydroclimatic modelling chain consists of twenty-four potential evapotranspiration formulations, twenty lumped conceptual hydrological models, and seven snowmelt modules. These structures are applied on a natural Canadian sub-catchment to address related uncertainties and compare them to the natural internal variability of simulated climate system as depicted by five climatic members. Uncertainty in simulated streamflow under current and projected climates is assessed. They rely on interannual hydrographs and hydrological indicators analysis. Results show that natural climate variability is the major source of uncertainty, followed by potential evapotranspiration formulations and hydrological models. The selected snowmelt modules, however, do not contribute much to the uncertainty. The analysis also illustrates that the streamflow simulation over the current climate period is already conditioned by the tools' selection. This uncertainty is propagated to reference simulations and future projections, amplified by climatic members. These findings demonstrate the importance of opting for several climatic members to encompass the important uncertainty related to the climate natural variability, but also of selecting multiple modelling tools to provide a trustworthy diagnosis of the impacts of climate change on water resources.

AB  - Soil degradation is a major agrienvironmental issue under Mediterranean climatic conditions. To assess soil erosion magnitude under orchard plantation, soils in an undisturbed area - located within an archaeological protected site in southern Spain - were analysed to establish its physicochemical status, the initial Cs-137 fallout and the natural level of radioactivity taking into account the content of naturally occurring radionuclides (NOR). The vertical profiles of NOR mass activities confirmed its non-disturbance. 90% of the Cs-137 content was concentrated in the top 20 cm and the physicochemical parameters confirmed as well the undisturbed status of the site. The base-line level of Cs-137 was established at 1925 +/- 250 Bq m(-2) with a coefficient of variation of 23% and an allowable error of 11%. This Cs-137 background was used to assess soil erosion magnitude in a close orchard field using the Cs-137 method. The maximum erosion rates reached 19t(-1) ha(-1) yr(-1) and a sediment delivery ratio of 29% was evaluated, both values confirming an unsustainable soil loss magnitude due to the combination of water and tillage erosion processes since the 1950s. The radium equivalent activity and the absorbed dose rate results highlighted a difference between eroded and deposition sectors in the cultivated field confirming that these parameters could be used to some extend to assess pedologic processes.

   Wood samples of larch (Larix sibirica LEDEB.), spruce (Picea obovata LEDEB.) and pine (Pinus sibirica Du TOUR), growing in the northern taiga of western Siberia, were screened for the occurrence of light-rings - an anomaly of tree-ring formation in extreme environments. Light-rings were dated and the resulting species-related light-ring chronologies were used (1) to explore possible causes of light-ring formation and (2) to reconstruct past extreme climatic events. Light-rings in spruce and larch were mainly formed by an unusually cool May, June, August and September, whereas light rings in pine were associated with a cool July. Between 1740 and 1997 we identified seven years when all three species had formed light-rings and 15 years when light-rings were formed in larch and spruce, but not in pine. As concluded from linear regression, summer temperatures explained 43 and 50% of the variability of light-ring intensity in spruce and larch, respectively. However, not all light rings were formed in below-average cold summers but in a few cases even in above-average warm summers, indicating the limitation of this approach.

AB  - Changes in oxidization-reduction potential (ORP) and pH along with ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in a twice-fed sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treating pig slurry were investigated in five experimental conditions with various aeration intensities, durations and feeding ratios. The lower the ORP value at the end of each non-aeration phase, the higher the nitrate nitrogen removal. To realize a complete denitrification, a supplement of organic matters should be conducted at a minimal loading rate of 45 mg BOD5 mg(-1) NO3--Nh(-1) for the non-aeration phase when the ORPAg/AgCl value reached -400 mV at the end of that phase. On-line monitoring results indicated that pH was more sensitive than ORP in revealing the termination of nitrification, not being interfered with variations of feeding load in the twice-fed SBR process. Additionally, both the pH variation rate and the logarithm of ORP variation rate are significantly correlated to the nitrification rate, expressed as the ammonia nitrogen decreasing rate, which could be used to estimate the nitrification rate during the aeration phase of the twice-fed SBR. In conclusion, the utilization of ORP and pH as indicators for process control of nitrogen removal had the potential to optimize pig slurry treatment by twice-fed SBR systems. (C) 2007 IAgrE.

AB  - The last five decades have witnessed an intensification of agriculture with a marked increase in the use of agrochemicals. This study investigated whether arable edges affect ancient woods and the extent of any modifications to the ground flora. Plant species were recorded from a total of 84 transects into the centre of the woods, of which 59 were taken from the arable-woodland interface and 25 were taken from non-arable land or woodland rides. Ellenberg indicator and CSR values were used to infer fertility and features of the environment. Results suggested that, after adjusting for light and moisture conditions, elevated nitrogen levels might occur in ancient woodlands to a distance of at least 100 m from arable farmland. Furthermore, the transects from the arable fields had a substantially altered herb-layer with respect to species composition, notably a greater percentage cover of ruderal and nitrophilous species, and a lower cover of stress tolerator species. Smaller woods contained a greater cover of competitor and nitrophilous species and a lower cover of stress tolerators and ancient woodland indicator species. We conclude that farming may be unwittingly modifying the ground flora of ancient woodlands adjacent to arable land and that small and irregularly shaped woods are most at risk. It is recommended that farmers apply agrochemicals in such a way that drift is minimised, and that large, valuable ancient woods be protected by a substantial buffer zone.

AB  - Effluent monitoring typically requires a large number of analytes and samples during the initial or startup phase of a facility. Once a baseline is established, the analyte list and sampling frequency may be reduced. Although there is a large body of literature relevant to the initial design, few, if any, published papers exist on updating established effluent monitoring programs. This paper statistically evaluates four years of baseline data to optimize the liquid effluent monitoring efficiency of a centralized waste treatment and disposal facility at a large defense nuclear complex. Specific objectives were to: (1) assess temporal variability in analyte concentrations, (2) determine operational factors contributing to waste stream variability, (3) assess the probability of exceeding permit limits, and (4) streamline the sampling and analysis regime. Results indicated that the probability of exceeding permit limits was one in a million under normal facility operating conditions, sampling frequency could be reduced, and several analytes could be eliminated. Furthermore, indicators such as gross alpha and gross beta measurements could be used in lieu of more expensive specific isotopic analyses (radium, cesium-137, and strontium-90) for routine monitoring. Study results were used by the state regulatory agency to modify monitoring requirements for a new discharge permit, resulting in an annual cost savings of US $223,000. This case study demonstrates that statistical evaluation of effluent contaminant variability coupled with process knowledge can help plant managers and regulators streamline analyte lists and sampling frequencies based on detection history and environmental risk.

AB  - Intra-specific variations in nonstructural carbohydrates and free proline were determined in leaves, apices, roots, and maturing seeds of two salt-tolerant cultivars (CR and Kharchia-65) and one salt-sensitive cv. Ghods of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in sand culture at various levels of salinity (0, 100, 200, and 300 mM NaCl and CaCl2 at 5 : 1 molar ratio) under controlled environmental conditions. The levels of leaf, apex, and root ethanol-soluble carbohydrates, fructans, starch, and proline increased in line with elevating level of salinity in all three cultivars under investigation. The contents of proline, soluble and insoluble carbohydrates in the apex increased to levels exceeding those in the leaves and roots. Soluble carbohydrate content of salt-sensitive cv. Ghods was higher in the leaves, apices, and roots and lower in the maturing seeds than in the other cultivars at all levels of salinity except at 300 mM. The results show considerable variation in the amount of soluble, insoluble sugars, and proline among plant tissues and wheat genotypes in response to salinity. Higher soluble carbohydrates and fructan in leaves, roots and maturing seeds of stressed plants indicate that their accumulation may help plant to tolerate salinity. Salt-sensitive cv. Ghods accumulated less soluble sugars in the maturing seeds and higher soluble sugars in the apices, which might be used as an indicator in screening wheat genotypes for salinity tolerance.

AB  - Laboratory toxicity trials may predict effects of chemicals under field conditions, but errors are inevitable, A chemical may be presumed harmless when in fact it has a detrimental effect, or it may appear highly toxic in the laboratory, but not in the field, Error rates depend on experimental setups, evaluation criteria, and ecological attributes, such as dietary range, of the organisms under study, The authors analyze results of standardized toxicity studies of pesticides on four species of predatory mites and assess the feasibility of drawing accurate conclusions from laboratory trials alone. This is by contrasting laboratory and field data, while varying interpretation criteria, At a 5% critical error rate, it was found that correspondence between lab and field experiments is only obtained for products harmless to Typhlodromus pyri, For this species these constitute only 30% of the total number of products in our database, Outcomes from lab tests with Amblyseius andersoni correspond with field results (for A, andersoni and A, finlandicus) tither for products yielding harmless or for products yielding harmful side effects, The decision rules required to reach either classification are not compatible and hinge on field thresholds that may be unrealistic, For Phytoseiulus persimilis only harmful insecticides and harmless fungicides enabled the setting of decision rules that resulted in correspondence between lab and field trials of more than 95%. Why these species require different interpretation criteria is discussed together with suggestions for improvement of existing test protocols and the feasibility of using indicator species.

AB  - Contrary to conventional agriculture, organic farming, where agrochemicals are entirely avoided, is considered more environmentally friendly. Numerous studies undertaken in agroecosystems have found that the intensification of agriculture has a negative impact on some small mammals species. In this study, we used two morphological indicators to evaluate the impact of agriculture intensification. Phenotypic variability and fluctuating asymmetry (FA- development instability proxy) have been widely used as morphological indicators of developmental stress. We implemented geometric morphometric methods to assess the influence of different agricultural farming systems on three rodent species. We hypothesize that conventional farming produces more stressful conditions than organic farming affecting species susceptible to agricultural intensification. We predicted that Akodon azarae, negatively affected by landscape simplification and more dependent on habitat quality, will show higher levels of phenotypic variation and greater FA in conventional farming. Whereas, Calomys musculinus and C. laucha, unaffected by agricultural intensification, will not show differences between farming systems. Akodon azarae exhibited higher phenotypic variability in conventional farms, while C. musculinus had no difference between farming systems. Contrarily, C. laucha exhibited higher values in conventional farms. Regarding FA, both Calomys species showed no differences between farming systems. Females of A. azarae tend to have higher FA values in conventional farming. Our results suggest that the effect of agricultural farming systems would vary according to the species, where the species most dependent on habitat quality would be more affected by intensive agriculture.

AB  - Increasing the income of poor rural households is essential for the realization of China's goal of sustainable development, which entails inclusive and equitable development and reducing the developmental gap between urban and rural areas. We conducted a case study of Wangqing County, a frontier minority area in Northeast China to examine spatial patterns and income differentials among poor rural households in this area. We quantified existing associations between household-level and environmental-level characteristics and income by applying hierarchical linear models. We subsequently applied Geographically Weighted Regression to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of the environmental-level variables and develop an understanding of the interaction mechanism of influencing factors. The results revealed that the distribution of villages, where income levels were similar, showed significant spatial agglomeration characteristics. Our findings also provide empirical evidence that household- and village-level characteristics together determine the income of poor households, but that household-level characteristics determine destitution to a greater extent than environmental characteristics. More specifically, the sex, health condition, and labor capacity of the household head, household size, the dependency ratio, social welfare, and off-farm work are significantly associated with household income. At the environmental level, arable land, the distance to the county center, and the average altitude had spatially heterogeneous impacts that varied in direction and intensity. This systematic study provides a more comprehensive and integrated understanding of the factors influencing the income of poor households in a frontier minority area in Northeast China.

AB  - The shared parking scheme improves the utilization rate of existing parking resources and contributes to the sustainable development of cities, but many private parking spaces that are not included in the shared parking scheme have a low utilization rate in China. In order to better promote the shared parking scheme, it is necessary to study the intention of the owners of private parking spaces to share their parking spaces. Therefore, this paper used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Benefit-Risk Analysis Model (BRA) as the combined theoretical framework (C-UTAUT-BRA). Hypothesis testing using the Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model was performed using an empirical assessment of the shared parking scheme in China. The results show that (1) the sharing behavioral intention (BI) is directly affected by perceived benefit (PB), perceived risk (PR), social influence (SI), and facilitating condition (FC) and indirectly affected by effort expectancy (EE), of which the total effect of PB is the largest; (2) exogenous variables have an indirect effect on BI through other psychological latent variables; among them, different sociodemographic and economic characteristics have a significant influence on different latent variables, while the built environment has no significant effect on latent variables. This research contributes to theory building in shared parking participation intention and informs business and government leaders on how to promote the shared parking scheme through the action mechanism of influencing factors on BI.

AB  - Evaluation was conducted to determine the impact of ecological condition to Channa striata using fluctuating asymmetry (FA) employing the landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis, using TPS software, SAGE, PAST-Hotellings Test, including Physico-chemical analysis, cyanide and four base metals. Results of Physico-chemical analysis of the two habitats showed Agusan marsh with low oxygen level (3.37-4.55) and high in Iron and TDS as compared to DENR Standards. The statistical results showed high variations (p < 0.0001) on left and right-side having percentage of 79.22% in Agusan Marsh and 72.35% in Lake Mainit which is relatively high Fluctuating Asymmetry. In terms of sex, Agusan marsh had 84.27% and 85.41% FA in males and females while Lake Mainit having 85.12% and 80.89% in males and females. The fairly similar percentage of Fluctuating Asymmetry confirms no sexual dimorphism and no shape differences between male and female, and no peculiar characters to distinguished between sexes based on the 17 landmark points. Present study concluded that FA observed in the snout tip was due to breeding behavior, the landmark points in cephalic, pectoral, and caudal region were associated with burrowing and mobility factors within the lateral line system in these fishes which thrive in high turbid habitat and low oxygen. Furthermore, it was found that the level of FA tends to increase in disturbed environs.

AB  - Information on the interactions of microplastics (MPs) with dissolved organic matter (DOM) is essential for understanding their environmental impacts. This study selected fulvic acid (FA) as a typical DOM to investigate the influence of contact time, temperature, dosage, solution pH, salinity, and coexisting metal ions on the adsorption of FA onto polyamide 6 (PA6) MPs. The adsorption kinetic and isotherm can be successfully described by mixed-order (MO) and Freundlich models. The adsorption site energy distribution based on the Freundlich equation was applied to analyze the interaction between FA and PA6-MPs and the adsorption site heterogeneity. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that the values of parameters (Delta G(ads)degrees, Delta S-ads degrees, Delta H-ads degrees) were significantly affected by initial solution concentrations and the adsorption process was spontaneous, endothermic, and randomness-increased. Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the importance of amide functional groups of PA6-MPs in controlling FA adsorption. Hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, electrostatic, and n-pi electron donor-acceptor (n-pi EDA) interactions played different roles on adsorption of FA under different conditions of solution chemistry. These findings are beneficial to provide new insights involving the adsorption behavior and interaction mechanisms of FA onto PA6-MPs for the environmental risk assessment of MPs.

AB  - In the present work, the exceptional electrochemical properties of carbon paper were characterized and explored in the development of a sensor for the anti-inflammatory drug, ketoprofen. An initial electrochemical characterization of the carbon paper with a redox indicator revealed much higher voltammetric peaks in comparison with other carbon-based electrodes, namely, screen-printed carbon electrode, boron-doped diamond electrode, glassy carbon electrode, pyrolytic graphite electrode, and pencil graphite electrode, predicting a good sensing performance. Ketoprofen showed a pronounced cathodic peak around -1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl (KCl, 3 M) at pH 5 in Britton-Robinson buffer, presenting a diffusion-controlled process. An optimized differential pulse voltammetry procedure was employed for ketoprofen determination achieving a limit of detection of 0.11 +/- 0.01 mu M, a linearity up to 6.02 mu M, and a high sensitivity of 24 +/- 4 or 35 +/- 3 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2) (depending on the calibration range: 0.088-1.96 mu M or 1.96-6.02 mu M, respectively) with acceptable (6-15% relative standard deviation) reproducibility and repeatability considering the challenging conditions of its detection in aqueous solutions. The sensor revealed to be highly selective in the presence of common interferents and other widely consumed anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, the developed sensor reached good accuracy in wastewater and fish samples with recoveries varying from 82.3 +/- 4.4 to 88.6 +/- 4.5%.

AB  - Existing guidelines and best-practices documents do not satisfy, at present, the need for guiding implementation of Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) based on core principles. Given the wide range of FLR practices and the varied spectrum of actors involved, a single working framework is unlikely to be effective, but tailored working frameworks can be co-created based on a common conceptual framework (i.e., a common core set of principles and a generalized set of criteria and indicators). We present background regarding FLR concepts, definitions, and principles, and discuss the challenges that confront effective and long-term implementation of FLR. We enumerate the many benefits that a transformative criteria and indicators framework can bring to actors and different sectors involved in restoration when such framework is anchored in the FLR principles. We justify the need to co-develop and apply specifically tailored working frameworks to help ensure that FLR interventions bring social, economic, and environmental benefits to multiple stakeholders within landscapes and adjust to changing conditions over time. Several examples of working FLR frameworks are presented to illustrate the goals and needs of communities, donors and investors, and government agencies. Transparency, feedback, communication, assessment, and adaptive management are important components of all working frameworks. Finally, we describe existing FLR guidelines and what we can learn from them. Working frameworks can be developed and used by different actors who seek to initiate an FLR process and to align restoration actions at different scales and levels.

AB  - Atmospheric oxygen has evolved from negligible levels in the Archean to the current level of about 21% through 2 major step rises: The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) in the early Proterozoic and the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE) during the late Proterozoic. However, most previous methods for constraining the time of atmospheric oxygenation have relied on evidence from sedimentary rocks. Here, we investigate the temporal variations of the Th/U of arc igneous rocks since 3.0 billion y ago (Ga) and show that 2 major Th/U decreases are recorded at ca. 2.35 Ga and ca. 0.75 Ga, coincident with the beginning of the GOE and NOE. The decoupling of U from Th is predominantly caused by the significant rise of atmospheric oxygen. Under an increasingly oxidized atmosphere condition, more uranium in the surface environment became oxidized from the water-insoluble U4+ to the water-soluble U6+ valance and incorporated in the sea water and altered oceanic crust. Eventually, the subduction of this altered oceanic crust produced the low-Th/U signature of arc igneous rocks. Therefore, the sharp decrease of Th/U in global arc igneous rocks may provide strong evidence for the rise of atmospheric oxygen. We suggest that the secular Th/U evolution of arc igneous rocks could be an effective geochemical indicator recording the global-scale atmospheric oxygen variation.

AB  - Diatoms have been successfully used as indicators of past and present environmental conditions in freshwater and marine habitats, but their diversity and indicative properties in microtidal coastal wetlands of temperate zone are relatively poorly studied. The goal of this study was to determine whether diatoms can be used as indicators of sea level and nutrient content in coastal wetlands of the mid-Atlantic region of the USA. Our exploratory analyses indicated that benthic and marsh soil diatom assemblages were jointly controlled by tidal elevation, salinity, sediment texture, and nutrient content, while the relative importance of these factors varied among datasets targeting different environmental gradients. The habitat type could be correctly inferred from diatom assemblage composition in 79% of samples. A diatom-based model developed for inferring sediment nitrogen content had an average accuracy of prediction of 12.5% of observed nitrogen range. Models for inferring tidal exposure from diatom assemblage data provided assessment with 11-16% accuracy as estimated by the bootstrapped root mean square errors of prediction, which is similar to the accuracy of models based on other microfossils. These results show that despite inherent challenges, such as tidal redistribution of diatom frustules across the intertidal zone, diatoms can be successfully used as an independent source of evidence in paleoreconstructions of sea-level change and nitrogen enrichment, as well as for monitoring current nutrient pollution in mid-Atlantic wetlands.

AB  - Background: Western Jalisco hosts archipelagos of Tropical Montane Cloud Forest, which have a high richness of rare tree species with restricted distribution same as in the eastern Mexico. At its upper limit of elevation form ecotones with fir forests.
   Hypotheses: With the increase in elevation, there is a directional change in the distribution of dominant species, vegetation structure and a decrease in woody species richness.
   Data description: The data analyzed included basal area, stems height, abundance, Shannon diversity, richness, and environmental variables.
   Study site and dates: This study was conducted in western Jalisco, at two localities with Tropical Montane Cloud Forest and Fir Forest, from September 2013 to August 2015.
   Methods: Woody species were identified and measured in 32 sampling units of 0.1 ha; regression analysis and multivariate methods were used to explore environmental variables associated with vegetation groups in relation to altitude.
   Results: Unimodal and linear patterns in structure and diversity were detected in both gradients. The analysis indicates five groups: lower montane cloud forest associated to mean annual temperature, annual precipitation and stoniness; upper montane cloud forest and fir forest associated to elevation and winter precipitation; and two groups dominated by Quercus-Pinus.
   Conclusions: The results show that different dominant species are associated with different climatic conditions and support two patterns depending of locality: a) Species richness decreases linearly with elevation in La Bufa; b) Species richness and structure show a unimodal pattern in Laguna Juanacatlan.

AB  - Pluvial flooding is a common type of natural hazard caused by rainfall events with high intensity and short duration, which may lead to substantial property damages, transportation interruptions, and casualties. Modern cities are susceptible to pluvial flooding due to dense population and advanced economic development. To facilitate the development of better flood control and risk mitigation strategies, this study presents a new quantitative flood susceptibility analysis framework to estimate the potential flood extents and scale. The framework is based on the multi-criteria decision-making methods within a platform of the geographic information system (GIS). A composite urban flood risk index (FRI) is derived from various flood conditioning factors. The FRI consists of flood vulnerability index, hazard factors, and resilience capacity indicators. The flood-susceptible map is generated using the GIS spatial analysis tools and the analytic hierarchy process method. Zhengzhou city, China, is selected as the case study area. The result map shows that the highly susceptible areas are mainly located in Jinshui District, accounting for 64% of the total area of the risk zone. To further validate this framework, a flood inventory map is produced by mapping 74 test locations identified through survey data in this area, followed by plotting a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC shows an area under the curve of 74.27%, which validates the proposed framework. Compared with other methods, the proposed framework is particularly suitable for application in data-scarce cases.

AB  - Water temperature is doubtlessly one of the most important factors affecting the well-being of fish. For pikeperch Sander lucioperca an ambient water temperature of > 20 degrees C has been suggested to achieve optimal growth in aquaculture farms, although natural habitats of pikeperch seldom reach such temperatures. We used multiplex qPCR arrays to assess the impact of temperature between 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C based on the expression of 38 potential biomarker genes characterising heat shock and hypoxia response, immune activation, energy supply and development in the liver and gills of pikeperch. In addition, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to assess the individual levels of glucocorticoids. Our data revealed that pikeperch do not develop severe responses to ambient temperatures between 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, although specific parameters indicated a phased restriction of optimal conditions, above all the heat-shock genes SERPINH1, HSP90AA1 and HSPA8b; the acute-phase genes HP, C3 and SAA; and the transcription factor-encoding gene HMX1. In contrast to these in vivo observations, a temperature rise up to 37 degrees C led to an acute response in VVF2-Sander cells characterised by the pronounced upregulation of HSP90AA1, HSP1A1, SERPINH1, HSPB1, HSPA8b and HSPB8. This report paves the ground for future assessment studies on the imbalanced homeostasis of pikeperch by means of molecular tools.

AB  - The agriculture sector plays a key role in Iran's economy, and the majority of farmers are smallholders who are highly exposed to climate change. To assess their vulnerability to climate change, this study investigates the general views and perceptions of respondents towards climate change, climatic hazard events, and the factors contributing to vulnerability. The assessment is based on a cross sectional survey that was conducted with a random sample of 280 smallholder farmers distributed in six counties of Iran's Hamadan province which is predicted to be affected by climate change. In this study 7, 12, and 23 indicators were applied for measuring three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The analysis combines two sets of climatic data which were obtained from Iran Meteorological Organization (IMO) and socio-demographics data collected by a questionnaire. According to the results the majority of respondents believed that climate change is real, and about one third of them acclaimed this phenomenon to be caused by human activity. The vulnerability assessment indicates that the majority of smallholder farmers were relatively vulnerable to climate change. Also, 13 factors highly contributed to vulnerability, including education, income, access to infrastructure, credit and land size. According to the results there is a need for the responsible governmental organizations of the Hamadan province to generate measures in order to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate change, and the government should reform environmental, institutional, and economic conditions to promote particular adaptation methods.

AB  - Background There has been little detailed systematic consideration of the delivery, setting and outcomes of paediatric Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT), although individual studies report that it is a safe and effective treatment.
   Objective This scoping review aimed to examine what is known about the delivery, settings and outcomes of paediatric OPAT and to identify key knowledge deficits.
   Design A scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley's framework was undertaken.
   Data sources Keywords were identified and used to search MEDLINE and CINAHL.
   Study appraisal methods Primary research studies were included if samples comprised children and young people 21 or under, who had received OPAT at home or in a day treatment centre. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to review the methodological quality of the studies
   Main findings From a preliminary pool of 157 articles, 51 papers were selected for full review. 19 studies fitted the inclusion criteria. Factors influencing delivery of OPAT were diverse and included child's condition, home environment, child-related factors, parental compliance, training and monitoring. There is little consensus as to what constitutes success of and adverse events in OPAT.
   Conclusions Future studies need to clearly define and use success indicators and adverse events in order to provide evidence that paediatric OPAT is safe and effective.
   Implications Consensus outcomes that include child and parent perspectives need to be developed to allow a clearer appreciation of a successful paediatric OPAT service.

AB  - In recent times, the tendency toward the use of combined heat and power cogeneration systems to supply the electrical and heat requirements has provided the heat for the buildings in addition to the cost reduction of the power distribution networks. In this study, the Carrier Software per 15th of each month did the hourly analysis of heating, cooling, and electrical loads for a 5-floor office building with a net area of 1000 m(2) (200 m(2) per each floor) in Tehran City (in Iran) and besides the average loads in that month were assumed. The mechanical air-conditioning system with absorption chiller is used to supply the heating load in the second half of the year (the autumn and winter), the heat pump system and the cooling load in the first half of the year (spring and summer). Due to the average thermal, cryogenic, and electrical loads, the number of motors required for the parallel mode of the power distribution system was 4 and for the network-independent mode was 7. The results show that the annual productions of are 648,640, 21,395, and 68,172 kg/year, respectively. The entropy production in cogeneration mode was 801,861.120 kJ/kg year. Besides, the prices of electricity in parallel-to-network and network-independent modes were calculated as 0.96 and 0.4866 US$/kWh, respectively.

AB  - Utilising a multi-profile palynological approach and a rapid scanning technique, this paper examines whether or not cereal cultivation is representative of a medieval Icelandic farmstead's social status; first as a correlate by confirming that cereals were grown in association with the archaeological features characteristic of high status and second, as an indicator in its own right through comparison with other datasets from inferred lower status farms in the same valley. The results suggest that medieval cereal cultivation in Mosfellsdalur was confined to the landholding of the Mosfell Estate. This is probably a direct consequence of the locale being settled early during Iceland's colonisation and thereby allowing settlers there to secure the prime location in the valley for agriculture. The later abandonment of cereal cultivation on the Estate also appears to be linked to social circumstances in Mosfellsdalur c. ad 1200. An evaluation of other pollen studies and historical sources intimates a transition in cereal cultivation from inland toward coastal (and perhaps geothermal) sites in the mid-13th century, probably as a consequence of the onset of the Little Ice Age. These sites may also be linked with high status institutions. Despite this effort to adapt to altered climate conditions, cereal cultivation in Iceland is believed to have been completely abandoned by ad 1500. Overall, the temporal and spatial dynamics of cereal cultivation are shown to be complex, subject to both societal and environmental changes.

AB  - Accurate population estimates and assessments of trajectory are an essential part of harvest management for game species and conservation action plans for protected species. Long-term monitoring can lead to ecological understanding by identifying biotic and abiotic drivers of population dynamics. Spotlight surveys are a widely used method to monitor abundance and size-class structure of crocodilian populations. The American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) has recovered from significant population reductions in the southeastern United States. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) has conducted alligator spotlight surveys since 1971 to monitor populations. We analyzed this long-term alligator survey dataset to assess possible trends in counts as a proxy for potential population changes. We tested for a positive trend in count data over 46 y and evaluated covariates that could influence counts to assist future survey protocols. Alligator counts during 1971-2016 increased across survey routes in Mississippi. This observed positive response may represent an increase of the alligator population in Mississippi as a result of conservation benefits accrued from improved wetland conditions and species-specific management policies. Evaluation of survey covariates indicated recent rainfall and increasing wind velocity had negative effects on alligator counts while increasing water temperature had a positive effect. Implementing robust survey techniques will improve the reliability of alligator monitoring data and their application to the management of alligator populations. Further, these improved approaches may be useful to other conservation and management agencies as well as for other crocodilian species.

AB  - Transmission line (TL) backflashover (BF) performance has been traditionally ascertained using a single number, the so-called backflashover rate, which is measured in number of BF events per 100 km-years. This paper aims at presenting a novel indicator for assessing performance of high-voltage TL tower's ability for tolerating direct lightning strikes without provoking BF events. This indicator is also defined as a single number, which can be computed for any TL tower (by means of EMTP simulations) and measures, in a novel way, its tolerance against BF events. It is given in terms of the risk of the BF occurrence, which means it is statistical in nature and depends on the total sum of conditions governing the BF events. The BF risk, as an indicator, is obtained from the probability density function of the shield wire(s) incident lightning currents and the cumulative distribution function of the BF currents statistical distribution. Hence, it merges complete probabilities of obtaining lightning currents striking a tower with probabilities of those currents provoking BF events on that tower. This novel risk-based indicator can be related to the price of that risk and the associated investment costs, enabling the cost-effective optimisation solutions to the problems of TL arrester applications and station insulation coordination design. This seems appropriate, considering the fact that the investment in surge arresters and related protective measures is commonly perceived as buying insurance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The control algorithm used for deciding on the speed limit in variable speed limit systems is crucial for the performance of the systems. The algorithm is designed to fulfil the purpose of the variable speed limit system, which can be one or several of the following aspects: increasing safety, increasing efficiency and decreasing environmental impacts. Today, many of the control algorithms used in practice are based on fixed thresholds in speed and/or flow. Therefore, they are not necessarily reflecting the current traffic conditions. Control algorithms with a greater level of complexity can be found in the literature. In this paper, four existing control algorithms are investigated to conclude on important characteristics affecting the performance of the variable speed limit system. The purpose of the variable speed limit system and, consequently, the design of the control algorithm differ. Requirements of the investigated control algorithms are that they should be easy to interpret and the execution time should be short. The algorithms are evaluated through microscopic traffic simulation. Performance indicators related to traffic safety, traffic efficiency and environmental impacts are presented. The results show that the characteristics of the variable speed limit system and the design of the control algorithm will have effect on the resulting traffic performance, given that the drivers comply with the variable speed limits. Moreover, the time needed to trigger the system, the duration and the size of speed limit reductions, and the location of the congestion are factors of importance for the performance of variable speed limit systems.

AB  - Trace element contamination is known to be widely present in sediment of Lake Roosevelt and the riverine reach of the Columbia River in Washington State, USA due to discharges from several smelters and numerous mines dating back to the mid-1800's. In this study, the concentrations of aqueous elements in contact with bed sediment from the lake and river were examined under varying degrees of physical mixing and time scales. Contrasting geochemical processes affecting aqueous concentrations were inferred from the release of major ions (Ca and Si), elements enriched in metallurgical smelter slag (Cu and Sb), and redox-sensitive species (Fe, Mn, Mo and U). Releases of major ions reflect the contrasting sediment substrates along the length of the river and large reservoir. Calcium released from carbonate minerals and slag particles was most pronounced in regions of carbonate bedrock and near sediment deposits with a large component of slag material, while Si released from unconsolidated glacial/fluvial sediment increased with increasing distance downstream. Sb release was a consistent indicator of slag presence and weathering, possibly because its anionic nature inhibits readsorption onto metal oxides. In contrast, Cu release was quite variable, likely due to varying degrees of copper readsorption or co-precipitation onto metal oxides. The release of Mo and U appeared to be affected by redox conditions, which were assessed using aqueous Fe and Mn concentrations.

AB  - Many forested mountain watersheds worldwide evolved with frequent fire, which Twentieth Century fire suppression activities eliminated, resulting in unnaturally dense forests with high water demand. Restoration of pre-suppression forest composition and structure through a variety of management activities could improve forest resilience and water yields. This study explores the potential for "managed wildfire", whereby naturally ignited fires are allowed to burn, to alter the water balance. Interest in this type of managed wildfire is increasing, yet its long-term effects on water balance are uncertain. We use soil moisture as a spatially-distributed hydrologic indicator to assess the influence of vegetation, fire history and landscape position on water availability in the Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park.
   Over 6000 manual surface soil moisture measurements were made over a period of three years, and supplemented with continuous soil moisture measurements over the top 1m of soil in three sites. Random forest and linear mixed effects models showed a dominant effect of vegetation type and history of vegetation change on measured soil moisture. Contemporary and historical vegetation maps were used to upscale the soil moisture observations to the basin and infer soil moisture under fire-suppressed conditions. Little change in basin-averaged soil moisture was inferred due to managed wildfire, but the results indicated that large localized increases in soil moisture had occurred, which could have important impacts on local ecology or downstream flows.

AB  - Status of the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, as a pest of cotton (Gossypium spp.) in the United States has diminished because of progress by eradication programs. However, this pest remains of critical importance in South America, and intractable populations in extreme South Texas and northern Mexico persistently threaten reinfestation of adjoining eradicated regions. The pheromone trap is an essential tool for detecting boll weevil infestations in eradication and management programs, and captures by the traps are also used to infer aspects of weevil ecology. Information provided by traps might be more interpretable if reliable morphological indicators can be identified from captured weevils, and less ambiguous if appropriate trapping intervals were identified to maximize the usefulness of those characters. Because captured boll weevils are isolated from food, key aspects of internal morphology were observed for informational potential based on their sensitivity to change in response to starvation. Condition of the midgut, presence of well-developed accessory glands in males, and presence of eggs as well as oosorption of vitellogenic oocytes in females, were particularly responsive to starvation. However, utility of these characters in interpretation of trap captures will require assessment of weevils that have been in the traps for no more than 1-2 d. Provided recently captured weevils are assessed, the characters we identify as indicative of a local source of weevils could improve the ecological information inferred from trap captures, and improve the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of remedial actions in eradication programs.

AB  - Trace element contents in coralline aragonite have long been used as proxies to record environmental growth conditions such as sea surface temperature (SST). In this study we explored whether trace element contents in modern and fossil corals (Cladocora caespitosa) from the Mediterranean could help constrain SST temperature and seasonality of climate in late Pleistocene interglacials. In modem Adriatic C. caespitosa, the individual corallite Sr/Ca signal captures seasonal variation with up to 68% of the variance related to SST. A similar but weaker relationship is shown by Mg/Ca. However, published equations to quantify absolute water temperature from Sr and Mg contents in modern C caespitosa did not yield consistent or credible results, because each corallite exerts a strong, non-predictable 'vital effect'. With no constant species-specific offset from equilibrium, temperaturetrace element relationships become, at best, colony specific and unsuitable for absolute palaeotemperature reconstruction. Despite this, temperature-related cyclicity in Sr and Mg is preserved in corallites up to at least MIS 7 age, allowing identification of seasonality in SST. In addition, unusual trace element anomalies in modem C. caespitosa can inform on events such as sediment discharge into the coastal zone. Partial diagenetic alteration of fossil C. caespitosa skeletons from aragonite to calcite destroys original SST driven cyclic trace element signals and is an effective indicator of corallite preservation quality.

AB  - Concentrations of Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil samples from Tibetan Plateau were determined. The average concentration of total 2,3,7,8-PCDD/Fs was (2.30 +/- 1.02) pg/g, and World Health Organization Toxicity Equivalency (WHO-TEQ) average concentration was (0.013 +/- 0.010) pg WHO-TEQ/g. The average concentration of Sigma PCBs (7 indicator PCB and 12 dioxin like-PCB congeners) was (16.2 +/- 9.25) pg/g, and WHO-TEQ average concentration was 0.043 +/- 0.049 pg WHO-TEQ/g. Comparing to previous studies in similar environmental conditions, PCDD/Fs and PCBs in this study showed a relatively lower concentration. The altitude dependences of PCDD/Fs and PCBs were also studied. Total organic carbon (TOC) normalized concentrations presented a quadratic relation with the altitudes, and an inflection could be found on the parabola of the total concentrations and some congeners of high concentration. The concentrations decreased with altitudes below about 4500 m above sea level (a.s.l.), while they increased with altitudes above it. These phenomena indicate that cold condensation of PCDD/Fs and PCBs would happen above 4500 m a.s.l, on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - The development of a decision support system (DSS) to inform policy making has been progressing rapidly. This paper presents a generic framework and the development steps of a decision tool prototype of geographic information systems (GIS)-based decision support system of river health diagnosis (RHD-DSS). This system integrates data, calculation models, and human knowledge of river health status assessment, causal factors diagnosis, and restoration decision making to assist decision makers during river restoration and management in Zhejiang Province, China. Our RHD-DSS is composed of four main elements: the graphical user interface (GUI), the database, the model base, and the knowledge base. It has five functional components: the input module, the database management, the diagnostic indicators management, the assessment and diagnosis, and the visual result module. The system design is illustrated with particular emphasis on the development of the database, model schemas, diagnosis and analytical processing techniques, and map management design. Finally, the application of the prototype RHD-DSS is presented and implemented for Xinjiangtang River of Haining County in Zhejiang Province, China. This case study is used to demonstrate the advantages gained by the application of this system. We conclude that there is great potential for using the RHD-DSS to systematically manage river basins in order to effectively mitigate environmental issues. The proposed approach will provide river managers and designers with improved insight into river degradation conditions, thereby strengthening the assessment process and the administration of human activities in river management.

AB  - The high-temperature clinoenstatite (HT-CEn) is one of the most important MgSiO3 pyroxene polymorphs, but the details of its structure and stability have been uncertain. The single crystal of the C2/c HT-CEn end-member is firstly synthesized by rapid pressure-temperature quenching from 15-16 GPa and 1173-2173 K. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows unusual bonding distances and static disorder of the atoms frozen in this metastable structure. The degree of kinking of the silicate tetrahedral chains is 175 degrees for HT-CEn. The chain angle for HP-CEn is substantially smaller (135 degrees), but the angle for L-CEn is in the opposite direction at -160 degrees (= 200 degrees). The degree of kinking increases by being curved by more than 180 degrees for the transition from HT-CEn to L-CEn. As for the reverse change from the expansion to the stretch, a potential barrier exists at the point of the continuity. It is suggested that the reason why a structure can be quenched under ambient conditions is as follows: the present HT-CEn single crystal has been formed by the isosymmetric phase transition from the high-pressure C2/c clinoenstatite (HPCEn). The presence of HT-CEn from HP-CEn in natural rocks is an indicator of quenching history, which leads to the possibility that it exists in shocked meteorites and impact materials.

AB  - This study examines criteria for the existence of two stable states of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) using a combination of theory and simulations from a numerical coupled atmosphere ocean climate model. By formulating a simple collection of state parameters and their relationships, the authors reconstruct the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) OFF state behavior under a varying external salt-flux forcing. This part (Part I) of the paper examines the steady-state solution, which gives insight into the mechanisms that sustain the NADW OFF state in this coupled model; Part II deals with the transient behavior predicted by the evolution equation. The nonlinear behavior of the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) reverse cell is critical to the OFF state. Higher Atlantic salinity leads both to a reduced AAIW reverse cell and to a greater vertical salinity gradient in the South Atlantic. The former tends to reduce Atlantic salt export to the Southern Ocean, while the latter tends to increases it. These competing effects produce a nonlinear response of Atlantic salinity and salt export to salt forcing, and the existence of maxima in these quantities. Thus the authors obtain a natural and accurate analytical saddle-node condition for the maximal surface salt flux for which a NADW OFF state exists. By contrast, the bistability indicator proposed by De Vries and Weber does not generally work in this model. It is applicable only when the effect of the AAIW reverse cell on the Atlantic salt budget is weak.

AB  - China is the largest coal ash producer in the world. Hydraulic ash transport systems are used in most coal-fired power plants, which lead to serious water pollution due to leaching of trace elements. The investigation on the leaching behavior of trace contaminants from coal ash is critical to environmental risk assessments. Batch leaching tests have been performed on the fly ash collected from each field of the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) of a coal-fired power plant to study the leaching characteristics of Cd, Cr, Pb and V. Leaching solutions included HCl solution of initial pH = 4 and NaOH solution of pH = 10. The liquid/solid (L/S) ratio was about 4: 1 in all leaching tests. Fourteen leaching time intervals were selected, ranging from 15 min to 7 days. The results show that under studied experimental conditions. Cr has a relatively higher leachability in the acid-leaching solution, while Pb has a higher leachability in the alkaline solution. With the increase of leaching time, the leachability of Cr in each ash sample increases obviously. Within the same time interval. Cr in the ash sample from the last field of ESP has the highest leachability. The concentration of Cd in FA3 is the highest, but the leachability of Cd for FA3 is not the highest among the three ash samples. The concentration of V in FA1 is the highest: no increased trend with leaching time has been found in the experiment. (C) 2009 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We analyzed biogeochemical characteristics of two temperate constructed wetlands in early and late spring to evaluate the utility of the macroinvertebrate community as an indicator of ecosystem development. The wetlands were similar in area, hydrologic regime, and influent water quality, but one was younger (15 y) and supported an early successional plant community while the older system (45 y) was forested. To characterize structural habitat in the two wetlands we analyzed water and soil quality, plant community characteristics, coarse woody debris, topographic variance and hydrologic regime. The correlation of macroinvertebrate community characteristics with structural variables was compared among wetlands, and macroinvertebrates were compared temporally within wetlands. Despite differences in nutrient concentration, substrate conditions, plant cover, and microtopography, the overall macroinvertebrate guild structure in the two systems was similar in terms of taxa richness, Simpson diversity, tolerance, and trophic distribution. Total abundance of macroinvertebrates was significantly correlated with a number of structural wetland characteristics, but trophic distribution was correlated only with nutrient availability. Temporal changes were apparent in both wetlands. The two wetlands supported proportionally different guild biomass in early spring, with the forested wetland dominated by grazing herbivores and shredders and the non-forested system by detritivores and predators. In late spring, however, there was no statistical difference in trophic distribution among the two wetlands, as both were dominated by grazing herbivores. These results suggest that macroinvertebrate community characteristics have limited utility as an indicator of successional development in created wetlands, as community characteristics are readily influenced by nutrient availability and temporal changes.

AB  - A simple and highly reproducible toxicity assay method was studied by employing 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) as a redox color indicator, baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a thermostable three-consecutive-stir unit. The absorbance of DCIP was decreased by increasing the metabolism activity of S. cerevisiae to intake glucose as an organic substance. By optimizing the measurement conditions, we obtained highly sensitive responses to glucose between 0.75 and 30 mg/L (eight points, n = 3) with an incubation time of the reaction mixture of 10 min at 30 degrees C. An excellent value of 1.15% was obtained as the average of the repeatability from eight points. Next, for the characterization of this method, we investigated the influence on the colorimetric response of dissolved substances, such as inorganic ions and surfactants, in natural water. Furthermore, the colorimetric responses to several toxicants were examined using Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, and Fe3+ as heavy-metal ions and simazine as an agricultural chemical. As a result, notable colorimetric responses were obtained for Cu2+ and Mn2+ at several concentrations, and the results were compared with those obtained using river water as a real sample. In the stability test, responses to 30 mg/L glucose were obtained for 28 days when the yeast cell suspension was stored at 4 degrees C (response reduction, 43.9%; average of the relative standard deviation for nine testing days, 22.7%; average of repeatability, 1.01%).

AB  - The enthalpy of vaporization of liquids and subcooled liquids at 298 K (Delta H-VAP(o)) is an important parameter in environmental fate assessments that consider spatial and temporal variability in environmental conditions. It has been shown that Delta H-VAP(o) for non-hydrogen-bonding substances can be estimated from vapor pressure at 298 K (P-L(o)) using an empirically derived linear relationship. Here, we demonstrate that the relationship between Delta H-VAP(o) and P-L(o) is consistent with Trouton's rule and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation under the assumption that Delta H-VAP(o) is linearly dependent on temperature between 298 K and the boiling point temperature. Our interpretation based on Trouton's rule substantiates the empirical relationship between Delta H-VAP(o) and P-L(o) for non-hydrogen-bonding chemicals with subcooled liquid vapor pressures ranging over 15 orders of magnitude. We apply the relationship between Delta H-VAP(o) and P-L(o) to evaluate data reported in literature reviews for several important classes of semivolatile environmental contaminants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorobenzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and -furans and illustrate the temperature dependence of results from a multimedia model presented as a partitioning map. The uncertainty associated with estimating Delta H-VAP(o) from P-L(o) using this relationship is acceptable for most environmental fate modeling of non-hydrogen-bonding semivolatile organic chemicals.

AB  - Asbestos was monitored in various plant samples around an asbestos cement factory. Asbestos residue was found on the surface of all plant samples monitored. Based on asbestos concentration found in different plant samples during monitoring and on the property of asbestos to cause reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative stress in animal models, laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the toxicity of chrysotile asbestos on an aquatic macrophyte, duckweed (Lemna gibba.). L. gibba plants were exposed to four concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mu g/mL) of chrysotile asbestos under laboratory conditions, and alterations in the glutathione and ascorbate antioxidative system were estimated at postexposure days 7, 14, 21, and 28 in order to assess changes in their level as suitable biomarkers of chrysotile contamination. Chrysotile exposure caused a decrease in total and reduced glutathione and an enhancement in the oxidized glutathione as well as the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio. An increase in ascorbate pool size, and reduced as well as oxidized ascorbate was found to be accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of reduced/oxidized ascorbate. Alteration in the glutathione and ascorbate level might be considered as a biomarker of exposure to an unsafe environment because these are essential compounds of the general antioxidative strategy to overcome oxidative stress due to environmental constraints. Because an increase in the oxidation rate of antioxidants weakens cellular defenses and indicates a precarious state, they could constitute indicators of toxicity.

AB  - Nest predation has been identified as the primary mechanism contributing to reduction of reproductive success for the marsh-breeding red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). Differences in rates of nest predation have been linked to nest site characteristics within a wetland, primarily water depth. However, the relationship between the landscape surrounding these habitats and the probability of nest predation is uncertain. Moreover, factors associated with reproductive success could be a potentially powerful indicator of ecological condition in wetland habitats. We investigated the influence of landscape pattern on nest success by monitoring 366 red-winged blackbird nests in 11 coastal wetlands along the south shore of Lake Superior. Of the 366 nests, 39% were successful, 56% failed, and 5% were abandoned or lacked sufficient evidence to determine nest fate. Nest predation accounted for over 93% of total failures. Predation rates ranged from 31% to 97% among the 11 wetland sites. We modeled nest predation using multi-model logistic regression analysis and the Akaike information criterion to identify and parameterize influential variables derived from the nest site, wetland, and landscape surrounding each wetland. Our results indicated that landscape variables comprised over 50% of model prediction weight in 15 of the 17 models. Nest failure was highest at sites within an urban/residential landscape matrix. Reproductive success could be a good indicator of the ecological health of Great Lakes wetlands.

AB  - We reconstructed water quality changes for 1800 to 2000 in Charlotte Harbor (Florida), a shallow subtropical estuary, by using a suite of biological and geochemical proxies in dated sediments collected in the region of a present day, midsummer hypoxic zone. The declining freshwater loading into the estuary from 1931 to the 1980s is not the probable causal agent encouraging the appearance or expansion of a hypoxia zone (measuring up to 90 km(2) in summer). Rather, the reconstructed trends in nitrogen loading indicate increased phytoplankton production has likely caused a decline in bottom water oxygen concentrations. Sedimentary biogenic silica (BSi), carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations increased concurrently with known or inferred changes in nutrient loadings. There were direct relationships between phytoplankton pigments and BSi, heavier delta S-14 with increased carbon loading, and sequestration of P, Al, and Fe as carbon loading increased. The results from the sediment analyses and the results from mixing models using C : N ratios and delta C-13 suggest an estuarine system that is responsive to increased carbon loading from the nitrogen-limited phytoplankton community and whose sediments are becoming increasingly anoxic as a result. The present nitrogen loading is about three times above that prior to the 1800s, suggesting that without management intervention the anticipated doubling of the watershed's population from 1990 to 2020 will greatly increase the nitrogen loading to this estuary and will lead to much higher amounts of phytoplankton biomass and accumulation and exacerbate hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) has been hypothesized to play a major role in N cycling in a variety of ecosystems. Our aim was to assess the seasonal and concentration relationships between dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DON, and NO(3)(-) within 102 streams and 16 lakes within catchments of differing complexity situated in Wales. Further, we aimed to assess whether patterns of land use, soil type, and vegetation gave consistent trends in DON and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) relationships over a diverse range of catchments. Our results reinforce that DON constitutes a significant component of the total dissolved N pool typically representing 40 to 50% of the total N in streams and lakes but sometimes representing greater than 85% of the total dissolved N. Generally, the levels of DON were inversely correlated with the concentration of DIN. In contrast to DIN concentrations, which showed distinct seasonality, DON showed no consistent seasonal trend. We hypothesize that this reflects differences in the bioavailability of these two N types. The amount of DON, DOC, and DIN was significantly related to soil type with higher DON export from Histosol-dominated catchments in comparison with Spodosol-dominated watersheds. Vegetation cover also had a significant effect on DON concentrations independent of soil type with a nearly twofold decrease in DON export from forested catchments in comparison with nonforested watersheds. Due to the diversity in catchment DON behavior, we speculate that this will limit the adoption of DON as a broad-scale indicator of catchment condition for use in monitoring and assessment programs.

AB  - A consortium of bacterial genera from raw and digested pig slurry (pig farm at Figa, Slovakia; input and output samples) was counted from February to October 2000. The total counts of enterococci and staphylococci were well-balanced in input samples, with visible reduction of cells in May (3.22 and/or 4.21 log c.f.u./ml). Among organisms important from a sanitary perspective only a slight reduction after standard slurry treatment was found between input and output samples (2.0 log cycles), with no effect in April and May. However, their counts were high (8.1-9.01 log c.f.u./ml). Yersinia sp. were detected in rather high counts (6.47; 6.39 log c.f.u./ml). But these species, as well as pseudomonads and Aeromonas sp. were very effectively reduced by standard slurry treatment. Enterocins (CCM4231, V24 and EC24) produced by our own isolates of enterococci were used to determine the susceptibility of selected microbial strains from slurry to those enterocins. For quantifying the inhibitory activity of enterocins, the titre (expressed in activity-arbitrary units [AU/ml]), corresponding to the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing a distinct inhibition zone of the indicator, was determined. Under the conditions used, enterocins used were active against the selected microbial consortium by activity from 100 up to 800 AU/ml. Moreover, enterocin V24 reduced the growth of Enterobacter cloacae ECL751 as well as Pseudomonas sp. minimally with differences of 1. 54 and 2.2 log cycles.

AB  - As a result of the continuous global warming in recent years, the average annual number of rain days in China has been on the decline, while the number of rainstorm days has gradually increased. These conditions make it extremely easy to form a waterlogging environment, which has an adverse impact on plant growth and development. In many apple-producing areas in China, apples are subject to severe flooding during planting. In this study, two-year-old apple rootstock M9T337 was used to explore the effects of interval water stress on the morphological and physiological parameters of apple leaves. The purpose was to determine the plant's adaptability to waterlogged environments and provide theoretical reference for management and maintenance after waterlogging. The results showed that the effect on flooded (T2) on apple stock was greater than that of waterlogged (T1), Short-term (7 d) waterlogging (T1) did not affect the growth of seedlings but was conducive to the accumulation of dry matter. Furthermore, the initial stress was be imprinted on the plants, which could directly affect their response to later stress. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that PC1, PC2, and PC3 explained 26.92%, 17.46%, and 13.03% of the physiological changes under water stress, respectively. By calculating the weight of each indicator, we concluded that high-frequency resistance r, relative chlorophyll content (SPAD) and maximum photochemical efficiency Fv/Fm are important parameters for apple rootstocks affected by water stress.</p>

AB  - Zinc is a widely distributed environmental pollutants and has been listed as priority heavy metal pollutant in China. Similar as other heavy metals, toxicity of zinc to aquatic organisms affects by environmental factors such as water hardness. It is necessary to develop regional water quality criteria (WQC) to protect native aquatic life against zinc due to the diversity of aquatic organisms' variability across different water systems, as a concretization and supplement for national zinc WQC. This study derived WQC for zinc by species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curve method. The zinc toxicity data of the aquatic organisms in Taihu Lake used in SSD curve was collected based on published toxicity data for zinc with hardness values and supplemented with acute toxicity tests conducted in this study. Six aquatic organism natives to Taihu Lake were selected to conduct zinc acute toxicity test in a range of hardness conditions. The relationship between water hardness and zinc toxicity was constructed. The criterion maximum concentration (CMC) and criterion continuous concentration (CCC) for zinc in Taihu Lake were then derived, which considered the water quality and taxonomic groups in Taihu Lake. The CMC and CCC were 100.69 mu g/L and 30.79 mu g/L, respectively. The environmental risk of zinc to Taihu Lake are acceptable, at moderate to low levels. This study has provided a basis for regional water quality criterion derivation and risk assessment in China.

AB  - This paper proposes a combined cooling, heating, and power system integrated with full-spectrum hybrid solar energy device containing molecular solar thermal system and solar water heating system to improve solar energy utilization efficiency. This system comprehensively integrates solar energy, fuel chemical energy and waste heat energy based on methanol decomposition to optimize energy utilization method. The thermodynamic models of components are established and the system evaluation indicators are presented. Based on a rated power of 834 kW, the thermodynamic performances under the design conditions were simulated and analyzed using Engineering Equation Solver, and the Sankey diagrams of energy and exergy flows were obtained in the respective cooling and heating modes. The results indicated that the solar energy share reaches 45.07%, and the energy and exergy efficiencies in cooling mode are 70.65% and 26.59%, respectively. They are increased by 1.52% and 1.92% in heating mode, respectively. The influences of various solar irradiation and power load ratio on system performances are discussed. The results indicate that the power load ratio and direct normal irradiance have positive impacts on energy and exergy efficiencies whereas they have negative impacts on solar energy share. Compared to the conventional methanol direct-fired system, the primary energy saving ratio and carbon dioxide emission reduction ratio of the proposed system reaches 16.20% and 16.14%, respectively.

AB  - Ancient proteomics is being applied to samples dating further and further back in time, with many palaeontological specimens providing protein sequence data for phylogenetic analysis as well as protein degradation studies. However, fossils are a precious material and proteomic analysis is destructive and costly. In this paper we consider three different techniques (ATR-FTIR, MALDI-ToF MS and chiral AA analysis) to screen fossil material for potential protein preservation, aiming to maximise the proteomic information recovered and saving costly time consuming analyses which may produce low quality results. It was found that splitting factor and C/P indices from ATR-FTIR were not a reliable indicator of protein survival as they are confounded by secondary mineralisation of the fossil material. Both MALDI-ToF MS and chiral AA analysis results were able to successfully identify samples with surviving proteins, and it is suggested that one or both of these analyses be used for screening palaeontological specimens.
   Significance: This study has shown both chiral amino acid analysis and MALDI-ToF MS are reliable screening methods for predicting protein survival in fossils. Both these methods are quick, cheap, minimally destructive (1 mg and 15 mg respectively) and can provide crucial additional information about the endogeneity of the surviving proteins. It is hoped that the use of these screening methods will encourage the examination of a wide range of palaeontological specimens for potential proteomic analysis. This in turn will give us a better under standing of protein survival far back in time and under different environmental conditions.

AB  - The objective of the undertaken investigations was to examine in laboratory conditions whether an introduction of an assisting opoka rock layer with the granulation of 1-6 mm into the ground improves the removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds from domestic sewage. The performed investigations concerned the layer supporting the removal efficiency of domestic sewage in a home sewage treatment plant under infiltration drainage. The model investigations of wastewater purification were carried out in a medium sand bed with an assisting, 0.10 and 0.20 m thick opoka rock layer. The effectiveness of wastewater purification related to basic qualitative indicators (total suspended solids - TSS, BOD5, COD, total nitrogen, total phosphorus) was in line with the Polish standards on sewage disposal into grounds and surface water. The medium sand soil bed with the 0.20 m thick assisting opoka rock layer showed higher effectiveness of wastewater purification than that 0.10 m thick. The application of the 0.20 m thick opoka rock layer increased the removal efficiency regarding TSS by 6.2%, total nitrogen by 20.4%, ammonium nitrogen by 8.3% and total phosphorus by 2.9%, and removal efficiency regarding BOD5 by 1.2% and COD by 1.9% with relation to the 0.10 m thick assisting layer (all percentages - in average). The results confirm that the natural opoka rock with the granulation of 1-6 mm can be used to assist in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds from wastewater with the application of infiltration drainage.

AB  - Purpose - Environmental treat poses a challenge to the entire built environment. This paper aims to focus on the building asset as the key element of any urban pattern, and, therefore, a crucial condition towards success or failure in achieving resilience. Through the environmental performance assessment of the adaptive reuse project in London, this paper identifies the design principles of resilience, focusing specifically on the measures for protecting vulnerable parts of the building from damage, as well as protecting exposed parts of the building from material degradation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the overview of both scholarly articles and practitioners' guides, the authors first offer a systematic overview of the main qualities and attributes of the resilient design. Further, to operationalise the resilient design principles, the authors use the well-established Building Research Establishments Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) on the case of adaptive reuse of the Z Hotel Holborn in London. Specifically, the authors examine if the case building applies the measures to decrease its internal vulnerability and reduce negative effects of external hazards.
   Findings - The study confirms that external shocks are controlled by protecting exposed building parts from degradation and that preventing damage to vulnerable parts of the building increases resilience.
   Originality/value - Through the analysis of both reactive and proactive perspectives of resilience, this paper elucidates the concept of resilience in the context of architectural design. Furthermore; this paper identifies the attributes of resilient architectural design and presents the measures which directly influence the durability and resilience of the building asset.

AB  - Demand forecasting for water resources is an essential planning element for cities to provide secure and sustainable water supplies. A common way of determining water demands is to identify indicators at the household level across a city or region, utilizing socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics of homes to identify patterns and trends associated with metered water demand. This bottom-up approach to water demand forecasting is in contrast to top-down approaches characteristic of urban metabolism studies. In urban metabolism studies, the city is viewed as an entity with material demands and wastes, including the withdrawal, abstraction, and discharge of water. Household studies have identified several important demographic, infrastructural, and socioeconomic indicators that provide insight into water demand. However, do these or similar indicators scale from the metered household to the monitored city? In this study, we approach water resource demand from a top-down perspective, considering the city as a singular entity. We utilize city-specific, readily available indicators, scaled from bottom-up studies, for social, environmental, economic, and infrastructure conditions to model the variability of water demand across the country. Acknowledging that there are seasonal dependencies of water use, we investigate water fluxes at an urban scale using a previously assembled database. We find that there are minimal similarities between indicators from the household level to the city level, suggesting the limits of top-down urban metabolism studies.

AB  - Nowadays the size and quality of potato yields is very important aspect in agriculture, due to the continuous climate change. Plants exposed to abiotic stress need new protection tools such as plant biostimulant. The new definition of this product include plant extracts as novel biostimulants. The aim of the study was to assess whether the extracts fromArtemisia vulgarisL. would act as classic biostimulants, by affecting metabolic pathways. Since these are pilot studies, the content of chlorophyll, carotenoids, proline and polyphenols was chosen as indicators of changes in plants. The experiment was carried out under controlled environmental conditions on a very early cultivar Irys. The obtained results showed that foliar treatment of plants with extracts fromArtemisia vulgarisL. had a positive effect on the increase of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content and its total concentration in potato leaves. The highest increase in the total chlorophyll content, amounting to 26.27% on average, was observed in plants sprayed with macerate at the dose of 0.6 mL center dot plant(-1). Additionally, an increase in the carotenoids content was observed in plants sprayed with macerate. The study demonstrated that the polyphenols level was largely dependent on the method of extracts production and the dose of the tested extracts. Macerate and infusion applied in a higher dose induced in plants the changes in the concentration of polyphenols. The overall evaluation of the effectiveness of the tested preparations showed higher effectiveness of the macerate for all the analyzed traits.

AB  - A model digital data processing platform is proposed based on "deep-learning" methodology that can be used to identify the emissions patterns from process plants with hybrid energy recovery and energy generation facilities. The non-invasive dynamic monitoring and correlation of particulate, VOCs and other greenhouse gas emissions from semi-batch and continuous process plants is demonstrated with use of neural encoding and pattern recognition using a multi-layer perceptron and multi-stack encoder configuration. A multi-layer environmental perceptron (MLEP) is developed based on the above analyses that aims to detect patterns of emission types, rates and concentrations as a function of variation of plant operational conditions and process variables. Four different task algorithms are constructed and are currently trained for use in (i) In-Plant Product Quality Control Domain and (ii) In-Plant Process Efficiency Target Control Domain. As a further consequence, environmental impact assessment is considered within the hazards and process safety frameworks that conventionally issue sanctions and penalize non-compliance with imposition of environmental levy scales rather than offering process improvement incentives. The latter is demonstrated to be possible by facilitating dynamic corrective action and hazard prevention using MLEP platforms should emission ceilings be frequently and/or periodically exceeded in 24/7 continuous plant operations. Potential applications of the MLEP (MLEP) are illustrated in the context of dynamic emissions control and abatement in hybrid energy process plants (HEPP) and combined power plants using process-integrated CO2 capture and storage schemes.

AB  - Several factors have been proposed as drivers of species diversification in the Neotropics, including environmental heterogeneity, the development of drainage systems and historical changes in forest distribution due to climatic oscillations. Here, we investigate which drivers contributed to the evolutionary history and current patterns of diversity of a polymorphic songbird (Arremon taciturnus) that is widely distributed in Amazonian and Atlantic forests as well as in Cerrado gallery and seasonally-dry forests. We use genomic, phenotypic and habitat heterogeneity data coupled with climatic niche modelling. Results suggest the evolutionary history of the species is mainly related to paleoclimatic changes, although changes in the strength of the Amazon river as a barrier to dispersal, current habitat heterogeneity and geographic distance were also relevant. We propose an ancestral distribution in the Guyana Shield, and recent colonization of areas south of the Amazon river at similar to 380 to 166 kya, and expansion of the distribution to southern Amazonia, Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. Since then, populations south of the Amazon River have been subjected to cycles of isolation and possibly secondary contact due to climatic changes that affected habitat heterogeneity and population connectivity. Most Amazonian rivers are not associated with long lasting isolation of populations, but some might act as secondary barriers, susceptible to crossing under specific climatic conditions. Morphological variation, while stable in some parts of the distribution, is not a reliable indicator of genetic structure or phylogenetic relationships.

AB  - Work, social and labor relations are changing rapidly under the influence of innovation. This is especially true today when the 4th industrial revolution and the digitalization expose social problems all over the world: environmental risks, an inconsistency between the quality of the workforce and the needs of the market, the deep stratification of the society and the growth of the poverty rate, etc. The authors in their article demonstrate the possibility and necessity to use social dialogue tools in order to solve global problems. To this end, it was proposed to implement the Sustainable Development Goals into the corporate social responsibility model through social dialogue. Having studied the interrelations of social dialogue and corporate social responsibility in the digital economy environment, the authors have built a theoretical model of digitalization opportunities that would affect the efficiency of social partnership. The article also proposes a methodology for assessing the quality of social dialogue, which consists of a number of indicators, including: the wages potential, the risk of unstable employment index, the general indicator of working conditions, the satisfaction with the social dialogue index. Based on the results of a qualitative analysis of social dialogue and content analysis of social labor contracts and agreements in Ukraine, the authors have designed a model of the innovation platform and experience for CSR projects and suggested ways to use digitalization opportunities to improve the quality of social dialogue and increase the efficiency of corporate social responsibility.

AB  - The metabolic activity of bacterial cells largely differentiates even within a clonal population. Such metabolic divergence among cells is thought to play an important role for phenotypic adaptation to ever-changing environmental conditions, such as antibiotic persistence. It has long been thought that persisters are in a state called dormancy, in which cells are metabolically inactive and do not grow However, recent studies suggest that some types of persisters are not necessarily dormant, triggering a debate about the mechanisms of persisters. Here, we combined single-cell Raman imaging spectroscopy and D2O labeling to analyze metabolic activities of bacterial persister cells. Metabolically active cells uptake deuterium through metabolic processes and give distinct C-D Raman bands, which are direct indicators of metabolic activity. Using this imaging method, we characterized the metabolic activity of Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We found that persister cells of M. smegmatis show certain metabolic activity and active cell growth in the presence of the antibiotic rifampicin. Interestingly, persistence is not correlated with growth rate prior to antibiotic exposure. These results show that dormancy is not responsible for the persistence of M. smegmatis cells against rifampicin, suggesting that the mechanism of persistence largely varies depending on the type of antibiotics and bacteria. Our results successfully demonstrate the potential of our perfusion-based single-cell D2O Raman imaging system for the analysis of the metabolic activity and growth of bacterial persister cells.

AB  - This study aims to determine if the presence of Streptococcus salivarius biofilm changes the tribological response of the tooth/zirconia contact pair. Reciprocating pin-on-plate wear tests were carried out at 37 degrees C and pH 7, using an appropriate lubricant to simulate an oral environment accounting for the presence of a S. salivarius surface biofilm. Reference wear tests were also carried out in artificial saliva with and without added glucose in aseptic conditions. Tests lasted a total of 21600 cycles under an applied normal load of 1.98 N. Human molar cusps served as pins while medical grade Y-TZP samples were used as sliding plates. Microscopy and profilometry readings were employed for the characterization of pristine and worn surfaces. Enamel/zirconia contact during sliding is notably affected by the presence of a Streptococcus salivarius biofilm. When compared to aseptic reference testing with and without added glucose, the S. salivarius biofilm decreased the dimensional wear factor by 87% and 81% respectively, and decreased the coefficient of friction by 77% and 68% respectively. Results clearly show that a streptococcus biofilm can change the tribological performance of a dental system. This work demonstrates that the presence of biofilm should be appreciated for a dental tribo-sytem, and the authors propose that further works regarding dental wear testing be carried out introducing asepsis level as a fundamental testing parameter.

AB  - Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in microbial fertilizer can not only produce plant hormones to improve the growth of roots and shoots, but also accelerate the release of nutrients in traditional organic fertilizer. Using mixture of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and traditional organic fertilizer is considered an economical and environment-friendly approach. In this research, a multifunctional composite microbial organic fertilizer was found and tried to solve the problems of soil caused by long-term use of chemical fertilizer and change the irregular release of nutrients in traditional organic fertilizer. Using active microbial concentration and the release of nutrients as indicators to study the effect of the microbial organic fertilizer application on soil fertility, this study indicated that the quantity of active bacteria increased more greatly by turf application than other traditional organic fertilizer carriers. However, using mixed chicken manure (CH) and corn straw (CO) as carriers had same active microbial concentration compared with turf. It indicated that this carrier can be used as an alternative carrier to turf as non-renewable resources. The present findings showed that the CH + CO carrier had the optimal conditions with 30% water content, 30 degrees C temperature, and 10(8) CFU mL(-1) (CFU = Colony-Forming Units) initial cell concentration. The application of the microbial fertilizer was conducive to improving the rhizospheric microecological environment, improving crop yield and quality and alleviating the problems associated with long-term use of chemical fertilizer.

AB  - Thermal stress imposed on cows adversely affects health and productivity. Various thermal indices exist in the literature that can be used to assess the level of heat stress on cattle by linking environmental conditions with physiological responses. However, many of these indices either do not incorporate all of the environmental variables or may consider only the main effects of the independent variables without considering the interaction effects. The objective of this study was to develop a thermal index for dairy cattle, referred to as Equivalent Temperature Index for Cattle (ETIC), which incorporates air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and solar radiation and their interactions. Environmental and physiological data from two studies were pooled together to develop and validate the proposed index. The index (ETIC) expressed in terms of temperature units is derived from equivalent air temperature of relative humidity, air velocity and solar radiation. ETIC heat-stress level thresholds were defined according to the thresholds for temperature-humidity index (THI). The results indicate that the ETIC model predicts the measured physiological responses very well. The coefficient of correlation, R-2, for skin temperature, core-body temperature, and respiration rate were 0.79, 0.40, and 0.49, respectively. The ETIC prediction of skin temperatures, core-body temperatures, and respiration rates were better compared to that of three recently developed thermal indices (adjusted THI, heat load index, and comprehensive climate index). The proposed index could be a useful tool to assess thermal environments to ensure animal comfort.

AB  - Ecological effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) deposition on two hardwood forest sites in the eastern United States were simulated in the context of a changing climate using the dynamic coupled biogeochemical/ecological model chain ForSAFE-Veg. The sites are a mixed oak forest in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia (Piney River) and a mixed oak-sugar maple forest in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee (Cosby Creek). The sites have received relatively high levels of both S and N deposition and the climate has warmed over the past half century or longer. The model was used to evaluate the composition of the understory plant communities, the alignment between plant species niche preferences and ambient conditions, and estimate changes in relative species abundances as reflected by plant cover under various scenarios of future atmospheric N and S deposition and climate change. The main driver of ecological effects was soil solution N concentration. Results of this research suggested that future climate change might compromise the capacity for the forests to sustain habitat suitability. However, vegetation results should be considered preliminary until further model validation can be performed. With expected future climate change, preliminary estimates suggest that sustained future N deposition above 7.4 and 5.0 kg N/ha/yr is expected to decrease contemporary habitat suitability for indicator plant species located at Piney River and Cosby Creek, respectively.

AB  - Based on methane tri-reforming process, a novel syngas producing system is proposed. The proposed system is analyzed in details from the viewpoints of thermodynamics and economics. In order to calculate the reactor volume required for its cost evaluation, a one dimensional homogenous model, based on the chemical kinetics of tri-reforming reactions is conducted for a fixed bed reactor.
   Influence of some design parameters including the reactor inlet temperature, system pressure, feed composition and reactor length on the reforming process as well as on the system performance is examined. Then, an optimization process is performed to maximize the overall energy efficiency. The results of parametric study demonstrate that the main indicators of system including H-2 yield, H-2/CO ratio, CH4 and CO2 conversions, energy efficiency and unit cost of the produced syngas are enhanced at thermodynamic conditions of high temperatures and low pressures. It is observed that, when the H2O concentration in the feed composition increases or the CO2 concentration decreases, the unit cost of produced syngas is reduced. In addition, the optimization process yields a maximum overall energy efficiency of 92.46 %. At this optimum design point, the unit cost of produced syngas is calculated as 4.48 $/GJ. Moreover, it is revealed that close to the reactor entrance, all oxygen is consumed by the methane combustion and the mixture temperature increases rapidly to a maximum value.

AB  - To be environmentally sustainable, the ocean disposal of domestic sewage via a sea outfall must be carefully studied, such as previous modeling of waste-plume dispersion processes, for environmental impact assessments. A scale model, reproducing the Santos Bay and Estuary was calibrated at the Hydraulic Laboratory of Polytechnic School, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The complete modeling of this large estuarine system used numerical and scale models, which were all related to each other. Such an overall model, composed of individual hydraulic and numerical components, is called a hybrid model. It combines the advantages of both model components and adequate field survey measurements and is particularly important for simulating the plume dispersion process in Santos Bay. The goal hereby is to present a performance comparison of the outfall plume dispersion for improvement in the length of the Santos outfall. The study required preliminary numerical simulations in the near-field mixing processes to define the boundary conditions in the beginning of the far field. In addition, numerical simulations in the far field were required to reproduce the wind effect for calibrating the scale model of the air-tunnel hydro-aerodynamics. Scale model runs, using an advanced methodology for dye-plume monitoring, were calibrated with a numerical model of the plume dispersion and validated with independent runs of another numerical model of plume dispersion and comparison with satellite images of the plume. The conclusion was that an enlargement of 1 km of the outfall would reduce the risk of the plume returning.

AB  - We studied the accumulation of the malondialdehyde and free proline in the leaves of woody plants which growing in the city parks of Dnipro in zones with different anthropogenic pollution. We registered the significant increase of free radical oxidation in the leaves of all tree species and at all monitored plots. The reactions of free radical oxidation were more intense in zones with heavy pollution and vice versa. The most intensive accumulation of products of free radical oxidation were observed in the assimilative organs of Tilia cordata Mill. and Acer platanoides L. In Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Biota orientalis Endl. the accumulated products were registered in slightly less but still significant amounts. The quantities of proline in trees of the city parks located in different functional areas exceeded the corresponding control values. The highest concentration of amino acid and malonic dialdehyde were registered in the assimilative organs of the trees from urban parks with heavy level of pollution while the lowest concentration of amino acid was registered in the trees of park located far from industrial zones. On average, amino acid content ranges between 122.61 and 585.77% from the control values. The high level of proline accumulation was observed in the leaves of Robinia pseudoacacia L., since this species is the most environment-resistant. The levels of proline accumulation attributable to anthropogenic pollution of the leaves of Tilia cordata Mill. and Robinia pseudoacacia L. were almost identical.

AB  - Key message This research demonstrates that inadequate chilling has the potential to slow both the rate and speed of bud burst of two important European forest species; Betula pubescens and Populus tremula.
   Context The timing of bud burst in deciduous trees has been widely used as an indicator of spring warming. However, winter chilling conditions can have a significant impact on the timing of bud burst. If trees receive insufficient chilling, there may be a delay in bud burst even if spring temperatures rise. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of chilling on spring phenology of trees.
   Methods Here, we exposed juvenile (3-6-year old) birch (B. pubescens Ehrh.) and aspen (P. tremula L.) trees to a range of photoperiods, chilling durations and forcing temperatures in controlled environment chambers to assess the impact on the timing of bud burst.
   Results Analysis of variance demonstrated that longer chilling duration resulted in earlier bud burst in both species, and less thermal time was needed to reach maximum bud burst. Therefore, in warmer winters bud burst in spring may be expected to be delayed if insufficient chilling is received. However, longer photoperiod may, at least in part, compensate for shorter chilling duration. These results suggest that models predicting climate warming impacts on phenology should take winter chilling into account when considering the timing of bud burst in deciduous species.

AB  - Fatty acids are among the least understood nutrients in marine environments, despite their profile as key energy components of food webs and that they are essential to all life forms. Presented here is a novel approach to predict the spatial-temporal distributions of fatty acids in marine resources using generalized additive mixed models. Fatty acid tracers (FAT) of key primary producers, nutritional condition indices and concentrations of two essential long-chain (>= C-20) omega-3 fatty acids (EFA) measured in muscle of albacore tuna, Thunnus alalunga, sampled in the south-west Pacific Ocean were response variables. Predictive variables were: location, time, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chla), and phytoplankton biomass at time of catch and curved fork length. The best model fit for all fatty acid parameters included fish length and SST. The first oceanographic contour maps of EFA and FAT (FATscapes) were produced and demonstrated clear geographical gradients in the study region. Predicted changes in all fatty acid parameters reflected shifts in the size-structure of dominant primary producers. Model projections show that the supply and availability of EFA are likely to be negatively affected by increases in SST especially in temperate waters where a 12% reduction in both total fatty acid content and EFA proportions are predicted. Such changes will have large implications for the availability of energy and associated health benefits to high-order consumers. Results convey new concerns on impacts of projected climate change on fish-derived EFA in marine systems.

AB  - The BioValueChain model facilitates the calculation of environmental impacts throughout the value chain for production of biogas from organic waste and manure in Norway. This paper describes the methodology of the model, presents the results based on general data and performs a sensitivity analysis for the input data.
   The model is based on life cycle assessment methodology and defines the boundaries of the system and a set of default parameter values which can easily be changed to obtain relevant results for a specific region or a specific biogas plant.
   The general results from application of the model show that the application of biogas and digestate, including the assumption regarding which products are substituted, has significance for the results. The sensitivity analysis reveals that results for global warming potential (GWP) appear to be less sensitive for the different parameter values than the other environmental indicators. Increased biogas production from source separated organic household waste and manure from cattle and pigs appears to be an appropriate greenhouse gases (GHG) mitigation measure for Norwegian conditions if the biogas substitutes fossil fuels and if the digestate substitutes mineral fertiliser.
   The results underline the need for the use of specific data, especially for transport distances, biogas potential and efficiency of biogas plant. Furthermore, in order to decrease the uncertainty of the results, more research is required into ways of modelling and quantifying direct emissions from the storage and application of manure and digestate on land.

AB  - Suspended particles (SP) are one of the problems of most concern about air pollution in urban areas, due to its adverse effects on health and environment. Epidemiological studies have shown that SP smaller than 10 microns (PM10) are particularly dangerous. Regarding ambient air monitoring, the reference method for estimating human exposure to SP, is the high volume method (HV), which was established through a collaborative study, based on measurements of total suspended particles (TSP). The aim of this study was to determine the applicable quality indicators to HV measurement of SP less than 10 microns using PM10 heads and cascade impactors (ImpC). Samples were taken with samplers operating simultaneously in the same place, following EPA reference method IO. 2.1. Limits of detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) for PM10 measurements were 0.56 and 2.71 mu g/m(3) respectively, which also apply for ImpC stage 6 (E6). For ImpC stages E1 to E5, LoD was 0.54 mu g/m(3) and LoQ was 1.38 mu g/m(3). Repeatability of the method was 3.04 % for PM10, and ranged from 1.7 % (E2) to 6.8 % (E3). Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between means of concentrations obtained simultaneously with different samplers (P > 0.05). According to these results, the method is suitable for PM10 and smaller fractions (using cascade impactors) measurements and can give accurate results in a wide range of environmental conditions.

AB  - Background: Though hypertension is a commonly studied risk factor for white matter lesions (WMLs), measures of blood pressure may fluctuate depending on external conditions resulting in measurement error. Indicators of arterial stiffening and reduced elasticity may be more sensitive indicators of risk for WMLs in aging; however the interdependent nature of vascular indicators creates statistical complications.
   Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine whether a factor score comprised of multiple vascular indicators would be a stronger predictor of WMLs than traditional measures of blood pressure.
   Methods: In a sample of well-characterized nondemented older adults, we used a factor analytic approach to account for variance common across multiple vascular measures while reducing measurement error. The result was a single factor score reflecting arterial stiffness and reduced elasticity. We used this factor score to predict white matter lesion volumes acquired via fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: The combined vascular factor score was a stronger predictor of deep WML (beta = 0.42, p < 0.001) and periventricular WML volumes (beta = 0.49, p < 0.001). After accounting for the vascular factor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were not significant predictors.
   Conclusions: This suggests that a combined measure of arterial elasticity and stiffening may be a stronger predictor of WMLs than systolic and diastolic blood pressure accounting for the multicollinearity associated with a variety of interrelated vascular measures.

AB  - The effect of promoted biota on the production parameters, water quality, nutritional and immunological condition of Litopenaeus vannamei was assessed in semi-intensive ponds. Earthen ponds were used as experimental units: three with formulated + natural promoted feed + shrimp (T1), three with formulated feed + shrimp (T2), and three with promoted natural feed without shrimp (Control). The dissolved oxygen (DO) levels were optimal for all treatments (>= 6 mg L-1) as well as the pH (8.4-8.6). Total ammonia nitrogen was greater in T2 (0.10 mg L-1) than T1 (0.07 mg L-1) and the Control (0.06 mg L-1). Phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthos were more abundant in T1 and the Control. The promotion of natural feed had a positive effect on all the production parameters of shrimp with an increase of 19.0%, 3.5% and 23.9% in weight gain, survival, and final biomass, respectively; also it was observed a decrease of 13.9% in feed conversion ratio. No differences in haemolymph parameters were observed for nutritional indicators (glucose, cholesterol, proteins, and triglycerides) nor for immunological response (phenoloxidase and prophenoloxidase). The results indicate that the promotion of biotic communities enhances the production parameters of farmed shrimp, without affecting the nutritional and immunological status. Also the water quality was improved by the presence of biota.

AB  - Electrodes have become more and more Popular in biomedical and bioengineering applications, where they are used mostly to apply/measure potentials or currents to/from biological systems. Under such conditions, electrochemical reactions commonly occur at the electrode surface. With the aim to better describe these processes we applied constant currents using transparent indium tin oxide microelectrodes to induce a local change in pH. associated with electrolysis. The pH change was monitored optically within the first lateral 170 mu m, vicinity using microscopy and a pH sensitive fluorescent dye combination its indicator. The data were then fitted with a simple diffusion model. The effect of such an induced pH change was also assessed by measuring the desorption of a cationic polyelectrolyte (poly(L-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol)) as a function of the local pH. Since this polymer interacts electrostatically with surfaces in a pH dependent manner, we could show a strong effect in unbuffered solutions while buffered solutions restricted the electrochemically induced pH change below the optical resolution of the microscope. The effect of applied current on the behavior of cells was also Studied on myoblasts cultured directly on the microclectrodes. We have found that current densities larger than 0.57 A m(-2) in induced cell death within 2 min of exposure. Based on our model we could attribute this to the change in local pH although the effect of other electrochemically created reactive molecules could not be excluded.

AB  - Microstructural characteristics of various real Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts for methanol steam reforming (MSR) were investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and electron microscopy (TEM). Structure-activity correlations of binary Cu/ZnO model catalysts were compared to microstructural properties of the ternary catalysts obtained from in situ experiments under MSR conditions. Similar to the binary system, in addition to a high specific copper surface area the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts is determined by defects in the bulk structure. The presence of lattice strain in the copper particles as the result of an advanced Cu-ZnO interface was detected only for the most active Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in this study. Complementarily, a highly defect rich nature of both Cu and ZnO has been found in the short-range order structure (XAS). Conventional TPR and TEM investigations confirm a homogeneous microstructure of Cu and ZnO particles with a narrow particle size distribution. Conversely, a heterogeneous microstructure with large copper particles and a pronounced bimodal particle size distribution was identified for the less active catalysts. Apparently, lattice strain in the copper nanoparticles is an indicator for a homogeneous microstructure of superior Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for methanol chemistry. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Differenced North America from multispectral satellite imagery, but has not been rigorously validated across the great diversity in vegetation types. The importance of these maps to fire rehabilitation crews highlights the need for continued assessment of alternative remote sensing approaches. To meet this need, this study presents a first preliminary comparison of immediate post-fire char (black ash) fraction, as measured by linear spectral unmixing, and Delta NBR, with two quantitative one-year post-fire field measures indicative of canopy and sub-canopy conditions: % live tree and dry organic litter weight ( gm 22). Image analysis was applied to Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery acquired both before and immediately following the 2000 Jasper Fire, South Dakota. Post-fire field analysis was conducted one-year post-fire. Although the immediate post-fire char fraction (r(2)=50.56, SE=28.03) and Delta NBR (r(2)=0.55, SE=29.69) measures produced similarly good predictions of the % live tree, the standard error in the prediction of litter weight with the char fraction method (r(2=)0.55, SE=4.78) was considerably lower than with DNBR (r(2)=0.52, SE=8.01). Although further research is clearly warranted to evaluate more field measures, in more fires, and across more fire regimes, the char fraction may be a viable approach to predict longer-term indicators of ecosystem recovery and may potentially act as a surrogate retrospective measure of the fire intensity.

AB  - Increased focus on the possible evironmental risk associated with large-scale use of grouting agents has revealed that leakage of chemicals from grouting activities may cause harm to the environment. Chemical grouting agents are used to reduce water leakages in e.g. tunnel constructions. The present study focuses on monitoring results and environmental risk caused by releases of non-polymerised monomers during use of the acrylamide-based grouting agent Rhoca-Gil (Siprogel). Drainage water From the tunnel Romeriksporten was monitored with respect to acrylamide and methylolacrylamide. as leakage of these substances was observed earlier in connection with similar constructions where Rhoca-Gil was used. Concentrations of acrylamide and methylolacrylamide in the draining water showed that these substances leaked nut both in connection with the injection of Rhoca-Gil and in connection with after-injection using other grouting agents. Gel formation studies with Rhoca-Gil showed that a low degree of polymerisation land hence, large leakages of monomers) can be expected if the product is diluted with water. Results From investigation of the environmental fate of methylolacrylamide showed that this substance is chemically transformed at the high-pH conditions of the tunnel. Ecotoxicological testing of the substances and an environmental effects assessment for the receiving water (River Alna and the Oslofjord) showed th;lt the discharge of acrylamide and methylolacrylamide may have caused effects on the aquatic life in the river and in a limited area of the fjord.

AB  - The elemental and biochemical composition of particulate organic matter (POM) was investigated in the Straits of Magellan during February-March 1991. Twenty-two stations were selected in order to identify different areas of the Magellan ecosystem from a trophic point of view. The Strait of Magellan can be divided into three subsystems characterized by different hydrological and geomorphological conditions. Seston concentrations were mostly constrained by physical events, particularly the influence of oceanic and land run-off water inputs and the strong vertical mixing and resuspension events. POM composition displayed quali-quantitative differences between the three areas. In the first subsystem, influenced by Pacific waters, the low seston and POM concentrations and the high POC/Chl-a ratio values indicated the general predominance of the detrital and heterotrophic fractions. In the second subsystem, characterized by superficial stratification, higher seston and organic matter concentrations and lower values of POC/Chl-a ratio were found, indicating that this subsystem was influenced by an active autotrophic component. Shallow waters with intense tidal regime and strong vertical mixing characterized the third subsystem, connected to the Atlantic Ocean, which displayed an increasing importance of the inorganic fraction (values of the POC/TSM ratio lower than in the other systems). Moreover, the third subsystem showed higher values of the RNA/DNA ratio, possibly indicating that resuspension events may enhance the metabolic stare of the organic particles mainly dominated by heterotrophic components.

AB  - In a series of experiments the desiccation-sensitive seeds of Quercus robur were exposed to drying conditions both before and after a period of moist storage. Viability loss occurred at higher moisture contents in stored seed than in newly harvested seeds. Measurements were made at intervals during desiccation, In both stored and unstored seeds viability loss was preceded by an increase in the rate of ethane evolution, a commonly used indicator of lipid peroxidation, and by an increase in electrolyte leakage indicative of membrane damage. Jasmonic acid (JA), its methyl ester (MeJA) and ABA were quantified in the same extracts from both cotyledonary and axis tissues. The concentration of all three hormones was higher in the axis than in the cotyledons of untreated seeds and were within the range of concentrations quantified elsewhere in seed tissues from other species, The concentration of JA, MeJA and ABA progressively increased during drying in both cotyledons and axes of whole seeds and in excised axes prior to viability loss and then subsequently declined. The concentration of these hormones increased earlier during drying in stored seeds in line with their enhanced desiccation sensitivity.
   Exogenous JA, MeJA and ABA were shown to inhibit germination. However, none of these substances promoted ethylene evolution, which also inhibits germination of Q. robur seeds, or induced senescence-like deterioration.
   The results presented are discussed in relation to the nature of desiccation sensitivity and viability loss in Q. robur seeds.

AB  - Vigour testing was undertaken on seed from 4 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivars taken from field trials in eastern Australia. The seed from each cultivar exhibited moderate to good germination and a range in vigour. Vigour tests consisted of the controlled deterioration and modified versions of the accelerated aging test. Accelerated aging was carried out in 4 ways using 2 periods of incubation (76 and 96 h), with or without the seed protectant Thiram to control saprophytic fungi. Results were compared with seedling emergence from the same seed samples when planted in a controlled environment glasshouse. A combination of 2 day/night temperatures, cold (28/13 degrees C), warm (33/28 degrees C), and 3 soil moisture regimes, dry (-0.3 MPa), field capacity (-0.01 MPa) and saturated soil, produced a total of 6 different environments. Emergence was also recorded under a moderate day/night temperature of 23/18 degrees C in soil at field capacity. The standard germination test and modified accelerated aging test with a 72-h incubation period with Thiram were significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with emergence from all 7 soil environments. A 96-h period of accelerated aging (with or without Thiram) tended to suppress germination and there was no correlation with emergence from most soil environments. The controlled deterioration test correlated with seedling emergence from most soil environments except for dry soil. The vigour test which gave the best indicator of performance under a range of different seedbed moisture and temperature conditions was the modified accelerated aging test using a 72-h incubation period with Thiram.

AB  - In temperate regions of the world dominated by intensive agriculture, cities harbor a rich diversity and abundance of bee species, often exceeding those of the rural environment. In less industrialized tropical countries, in contrast, stressful conditions may exist in cities for bees with perennial colonies such as stingless bees because of the lack of resources such as amenity green spaces (flowers) and appropriate nesting sites. Yet, we currently lack studies on the ecology of bees in tropical urban areas to test this idea. Here, we compared the body size (as a possible indicator of floral resource supply) and the frequency of diploid males (as a measure of inbreeding) of a widespread stingless bee, Nannotrigona perilampoides, at mating congregations within the city of Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, and in surrounding rural areas. We found that males in Merida were significantly smaller compared with those in rural areas. While diploid males were found in both in the city and rural congregations, their frequency was significantly higher in urban sites. Our results suggest that the performance of colonies of N. perilampoides is poorer in tropical urban compared with rural sites, possibly as a consequence of limited resources and mating among a small number of colonies. We discuss the implications of these findings for the survival and fitness of stingless bees in the tropics.

AB  - Today inverter system is one of the enabling technologies for efficiently harnessing energy from renewable energy sources (Solar, Wind, etc.,) and also for high reliable grid interfacing systems. With the advancements in power electronics, inverter conversion efficiency pushed to 98%, also PV is becoming a major renewable energy source globally. Nevertheless, the reliability performance of PV inverter is of high concern. Different environmental factors like solar irradiance, ambient temperature (also called Mission Profile) affect the reliability performance of PV inverter. Environmental conditions vary from location to location. Hence to quantify the reliability performance of PV inverter all these factors need to be considered. In this paper reliability performance of PV inverter is evaluated considering environmental factors and geographical locations. For the reliability evaluation, a 1-phi, 3-kW grid connected PV system is developed in PLECS. Full bridge PV inverter with 600V/30A IGBT is employed as the interface between grid and PV source. Real time mission profile data of one-year logs at India (Relatively hot climate) and Denmark (Relatively cold climate) to account for environmental factors and geographical locations during the reliability performance evaluation of PV inverter. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate a population of 20000 samples with 5% variation. Lifetime for 20000 samples is calculated and fitted in Two Parameter Weibull distribution. Bio lifetime is calculated at two locations. The results of this paper reveal that environmental factors and geographical locations have a significant impact on PV inverter reliability performance.

AB  - From the chronological analytical review regarding municipal solid waste management (MSWM) and governance optimisation progress in Hong Kong since 2002, it is noted that the policy outcomes have seriously deviated from the original policy goals under the hitherto lack of effective development in bureaucratic and economic policy cultures in municipal solid waste (MSW) strategies formulation and related programmes implementation. The policy analysis specially stated that although the MSW recycling ratio (30%) is not particularly poor, the recovered percentage of plastics, glass and food waste in Hong Kong are extremely low. Based on the unfavourable outcomes and consequences for MSWM and governance in Hong Kong, a conclusion of negative correlation between the per capita MSW disposal rate and bureaucratic policy culture development, as well as positive correlation between recycling rate of low value items and economic policy culture development, can be made. With considering the key factors of benchmark indicators, socio-economic factors, driving force, and communication of MSW policy, conducive options and prospects are also developed for the attempt to provide insights to restructure MSWM and governance in Hong Kong in the next decade. First, the government can build up strategic innovation from a global benchmark case - MSWM and governance improvement from the South Korea case. Second, to create opportunities and conditions to develop high value biofuel from waste through flexible local environmental policies formulation and implementation. Third, shifting a front-line MSWM for governance structure reform.

AB  - Three-year observations made it possible to assess the degree of pollution and variability in quality of rainwater collected in two reservoirs in the Lublin agglomeration (south-eastern Poland). The studied objects are characterised by different construction, size, hydraulics and type of drained surface. In particular, a large variation in water quality indicators was observed for suspended solids, NH4+, NO3- and K+. Higher conductivity, NH4+, SO4- and Cl- was found in the reservoir receiving rainwater from the national road, compared to the water from the housing estate. In the second reservoir, a higher load of NO2-, PO4-, Fe+ and K+ was observed. Among the analysed variables, the most disturbing values were recorded for conductivity, pH, suspended solids, oxygen indicators, NO2-, NH4+ and PO4-. The liquid flowing into the reservoirs during snowmelt was characterised by high pollution. In the year with the highest sum of atmospheric precipitation, there was a reduction in medium concentrations of many quality variables (flushing effect, dilution of pollutants). An increase in oxygen demand and oxygen deficits were observed in warm seasons. An emission of inconvenient odors in the vicinity of the reservoir in the housing estate was also observed. These phenomena may be intensified in the case of improper use of the system (e.g. when bottom sediments are not removed) and further increase of air temperatures. Under such conditions, the possibility of using open rainwater reservoirs near human settlements becomes questionable.

AB  - Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with infant low birth weight and with multiple health indicators affecting childhood morbidity and mortality. The condition is twice as prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries but poorly studied.
   Aim: To conduct a review of published literature on interventions for perinatal depression in LMICs.
   Methods: A search of the literature was performed for articles published up to October 2017. The key inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed studies focusing on interventions for perinatal depression during pregnancy and/or up to one-year postpartum.
   Results: 1088 citations were retrieved, of which 18 studies with representation from countries in Africa, Asia, North America (Mexico) and South America were included. The majority of interventions were conducted in lower-income settings. Most were psychosocial in nature and often provided by lay health workers and in the community. Interventions integrated as part of general health programs and employing psychotherapeutic approaches were more effective and were also preferred. Only one study incorporated the use of psychiatric medications.
   Conclusion: Despite the limited publications, there is reasonable evidence for the benefit of psychological interventions in perinatal depression in LMICs. More research is needed to verify and extend these results and, in particular, to evaluate the benefit of adjunctive medications when treating moderate to severe depression and whether interventions can increase social supports.

AB  - Business function-specific stand-alone enterprise applications (SEAs) are displacing functionally integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, despite strong empirical support for the business benefits of the latter. This study explores the conditions under which it may be more effective to use a set of SEAs instead of a single-suite ERP system, and vice versa. Based on Organizational Information Processing Theory, we expect differences in effectiveness to grow in prominence when the uncertainty of the operating environment increases, that is, when operational glitches in production processes become more frequent. Extending the existing literature, we postulate that high functional differentiation is a precondition for SEAs to be more effective than an ERP system, hypothesizing that the level of functional interdependence ultimately determines which type of software is superior for a given production process. We test our hypotheses using data collected from 163 make-to-order (MTO) production processes nested within 73 manufacturing plants and seven supply chains of complex, high-tech machinery. Results show that when functional interdependence is low, the negative effect of operational glitches on delivery performance is effectively mitigated in MTO production processes wherein process-related information is managed predominantly using SEAs; conversely, when functional interdependence is high, using an ERP system is more effective. Our findings offer practical guidelines as to when to use SEAs versus an ERP system while also integrating and updating the findings of earlier empirical research, in which each has been analyzed separately.

AB  - Due to critical impacts of air pollution, prediction andmonitoring of air quality in urban areas are important tasks. However, because of the dynamic nature and high spatio-temporal variability, prediction of the air pollutant concentrations is a complex spatio-temporal problem. Distribution of pollutant concentration is influenced by various factors such as the historical pollution data and weather conditions. Conventional methods such as the support vectormachine (SVM) or artificial neuralnetworks (ANN) show some deficiencies when huge amount of streaming data have to be analyzed for urban air pollution prediction. In order to overcome the limitations of the conventional methods and improve the performance of urban air pollution prediction in Tehran, a spatio-temporal systemisdesignedusingaLaSVM-basedonline algorithm. Pollutant concentration andmeteorological data along with geographical parameters are continually fed to the developed online forecasting system. Performance of the system is evaluated by comparing the prediction results of theAir QualityIndex(AQI) with thoseof a traditionalSVM algorithm. Results show an outstanding increase of speed bytheonline algorithmwhile preserving the accuracyof the SVM classifier. Comparison of the hourly predictions for next coming24 h, with those of the measured pollution data in Tehran pollution monitoring stations shows an overall accuracy of 0.71, root mean square error of 0.54 and coefficient of determination of 0.81. These results are indicators of the practical usefulness of the online algorithm for realtimespatial and temporal prediction of the urban air quality.

AB  - The challenge of identifying cause of death in discarded bycaught marine mammals stems from a combination of the non-specific nature of the lesions of drowning, the complex physiologic adaptations unique to breath-holding marine mammals, lack of case histories, and the diverse nature of fishing gear. While no pathognomonic lesions are recognized, signs of acute external entanglement, bulging or reddened eyes, recently ingested gastric contents, pulmonary changes, and decompression-associated gas bubbles have been identified in the condition of peracute underwater entrapment (PUE) syndrome in previous studies of marine mammals. We reviewed the gross necropsy and histopathology reports of 36 cetaceans and pinnipeds including 20 directly observed bycaught and 16 live stranded animals that were euthanized between 2005 and 2011 for lesions consistent with PUE. We identified 5 criteria which present at significantly higher rates in bycaught marine mammals: external signs of acute entanglement, red or bulging eyes, recently ingested gastric contents, multi-organ congestion, and disseminated gas bubbles detected grossly during the necropsy and histologically. In contrast, froth in the trachea or primary bronchi, and lung changes (i.e. wet, heavy, froth, edema, congestion, and hemorrhage) were poor indicators of PUE. This is the first study that provides insight into the different published parameters for PUE in bycatch. For regions frequently confronted by stranded marine mammals with non-specific lesions, this could potentially aid in the investigation and quantification of marine fisheries interactions.

AB  - Simulations of aerobic biodegradation have been widely employed to investigate the mechanisms of crude oil biodegradation in geological environments. In this study, a simulated biodegradation experiment was performed with crude oil under aerobic conditions, in which n-alkanes were nearly depleted, thus providing an opportunity to study the biodegradation mechanisms of n-alkanes in crude oils. The sequences of biodegraded oils with a slight to moderate degree of biodegradation were characterized by negative-ion electrospray (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and gas chromatography (GC). Semiquantitative results on the molecular compositions of heteroatom classes were obtained by coinjection of internal standards. The biodegradation mechanisms for n-alkanes and n-fatty acids, as well as some other heteroatomic compounds, are discussed, Evidence from FT-ICR MS and GC analyses of biodegraded oils indicates that n-alkanes can be progressively biodegraded to n-fatty acids through beta-oxidation, or to hydroxycarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids though omega-oxidation. The O-3 class species which have a high relative abundance in the carbon number range of C-33-C-38 with a Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) of 1-3 were assigned and speculated to be bacterial metabolites, which could be a conspicuous indicator of bacterial activity. Neutral nitrogen compounds, such as carbazoles, exhibited a very slight decrease in the stage of biodegradation that was investigated.

AB  - Ostreopsis cf. ovata is a benthic marine dinoflagellate, which blooms in summer along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, including many Italian regions since early 1990s. In tropical areas O. cf. ovata produces mainly palytoxins whereas in the Mediterranean basin it produces ovatoxins, and only trace amounts of a putative palytoxin. The toxicological profile of ovatoxins is still unknown. This paper describes the update of the Italian guidelines for the management of O. cf. ovata blooms related to bathing and recreational activities. The rationale for the guidelines starts from the current scientific knowledge on chemical, toxicological, and epidemiological aspects and on its diffusion, which are briefly summarized in the first part of the paper. On this basis a risk-based approach is developed, with the purpose to protect people from oral, dermal and inhalation exposure (the ones that so far caused major health problems), taking into account also the weather and sea conditions, which are crucial for the onset of blooms. Accordingly, the guidelines provide information on what indicators are needed to set up environmental monitoring activities and actions to take during diverse phases. They also outline a multistep health surveillance system, and a system of communication to the public. Finally the still important scientific gaps and research needs are highlighted.

AB  - Ground-level ozone (GLO) is produced by a complex chain of atmospheric chemical reactions that depend on precursor emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. GLO concentration in a particular location is also governed by local weather and climatic factors. In this work an attempt was made to explore a Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM) approach to quantify the inter-relationship between local conditions (weather parameters and primary air pollution) and GLO concentrations. PLS path modeling algorithm was introduced and applied to GLO concentration analyses at Gulfport, Mississippi, USA. In the present analysis, three latent variables were selected: PRC (photochemical reaction catalyst), MP (meteorological factor), and OPP (other primary air pollutants). The three latent variables included 14 indicators for the analysis; with PRC having two (extraterrestrial radiation on horizontal surface, and extraterrestrial radiation normal to the sun), MP having nine (temperature, dew point, relative humidity, pressure, visibility, maximum wind speed, average wind speed, precipitation, and wind direction) and OPP having three (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2) parameters. The resulting model revealed that PRC had significant direct impact on GLO concentration but very small overall effect. This is because PRC had significant indirect negative impact on GLO via MP. Thus, when both direct and indirect effects were taken into account, PRC emerged as having the weakest effect on GLO. The third variable (OPP) also had a positive impact on GLO concentration.

AB  - The conversion processes of macroalgae for biofuels can be divided into thermochemical (dry) and microbiological (wet) processes. The chemical composition of macroalgae together with the pre-treatment method, conversion conditions, and the characteristics of the microbes involved (wet processes) determine the yield and the properties of the biofuel produced. Macroalgae are often rich in carbohydrates, and therefore well suited for biogas, biobutanol and bioethanol productions. The content of triacylglycerols (TAGs) is the best indicator for the suitability of the alga for biodiesel production. TAGs have a high conversion rate to biodiesel, high percentage of fatty acids, and they lack phosphorus, sulfur and nitrogen. Macroalgae can have high metal concentrations, which can have an impact on conversion processes: metals may inhibit or catalyse the processes. High sulfur (especially in green algae) and nitrogen contents are also characteristic to macroalgae, and may be problematic in the production of biogas (NH3-toxicity) and the use of the oil and biodiesel (high concentrations of H2S and NOx-compounds). Macroalgae have proven to be suitable material for conversion processes, but further optimization of the processes is needed. At present, macroalgae are not economically, or in many cases not even environmentally, sustainable material when the whole production chain is considered. In this review we summarize information on the chemical composition of macroalgae in a prospect of biofuel production, and the current situation in the field of macroalgal-based biofuel production.

AB  - Biogenic silica (BSi) and phosphorous (P) accumulation were investigated in sediment cores from Karlskanrsviken, a bay of Lake Manlaren. The aim was to make use of BSi and P relations in sediment stratigraphies in order to investigate the historical nutrient trophy in a near shore lake environment since the Middle Ages, with focus on industrial times, and to evaluate anthropogenic influences on the bay's trophic state. The BSi accumulation in the sediments is a better indicator of former nutrient pelagic trophy than P accumulation in sediments and for this reason a BSi inferred P (BSi-P) water concentration is calculated. This method enables the determination of the background total phosphorous (TP) concentration (which is related to the reference conditions) in the investigated bay; this background TP is determined equal to 0.020-0.022 mg L-1. There is an increasing trend of BSi-P concentration in the bay since the Middle Ages to the present, about 0.025 mg L-1, with a small decrease in the inner bay section during the last decades. The P accumulation rate is not found to have changed since the 1960s and 1970s, which indicates that the P loading to Karlskanrsviken has not decreased. In Karlskanrsviken, the shallow inner section of the bay, where the water quality is dominated by loading from the bay catchment area, is less nutritious than the water in the outer section, which is influenced by the main streams from the western part of Lake Manlaren.

AB  - Current turbomachinery design systems increasingly rely on Multistage CFD as a means to diagnose designs and assess performance potential. However design weaknesses attributed to improper stage matching are addressed using often ineffective strategies involving a costly iterative loop between blading modification, revision of design intent, and further evaluation of aerodynamic performance. A scheme is proposed herein which greatly simplifies the design point blade row matching process. It is based on a three dimensional viscous inverse method that has been extended to allow blading analysis and design in a multi-blade row environment. For computational expediency, blade row coupling is achieved through an averaging-plane approximation. To limit computational time, the inverse method was parallelized. The proposed method allows improvement of design point blade row matching by direct regulation of the circulation capacity of the blading within a multistage environment. During the design calculation, blade shapes are adjusted to account for inflow and outflow conditions while producing a prescribed pressure loading. Thus, it is computationally ensured that the intended pressure-loading distribution is consistent with the derived blading geometry operating in a multiblade row environment that accounts for certain blade row interactions. The viability of the method is demonstrated in design exercises involving the rotors of a 2.5 stage, highly loaded compressor Individually redesigned rotors display mismatching when run in the 2.5 stage, evident as a deviation from design intent. However simultaneous redesign of the rotors in their multistage environment produces the design intent, indicating that aerodynamic matching has been achieved.

AB  - Ionic equilibria and fluorescence decay of rhodamine B were studied in micellar solutions of sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with various additives (NaCl, pentanol-1, crown ether, and tetra-n-butyl ammonium salt), and five nonionic surfactants (Brij 35, nonyl phenol 12, Triton X-100, Triton X-305, Tween 80), as well as in beta-cyclodextrin solutions. The apparent dissociation constants, K-a(a), of rhodamine B (HR+ reversible arrow R + H+) were obtained. The distribution of the dye species HR+ and R in the ultramicroheterogeneous systems was studied using absorption and emission spectra, fluorescence lifetimes, tau, and the plots of pK(a)(a) versus surfactant concentration. The pK(a)(a) values under conditions of complete binding, pK(a)(ac), were found to be markedly higher than that in water (pK(a)(w)). The medium effects, DeltapK(a)(ac) = pK(a)(ac) - pK(a)(w), in organized solutions studied are in accord with the charge type of the acid-base couple +/+/-, confirming the zwitterionic nature of rhodamine B neutral species. Both tau and DeltapK(a)(ac) values of the dye were shown to sense the changes in the micellar microenvironments, and the possibility of using rhodamine B as an interfacial acid-base indicator, for example, for monitoring of surface potentials and of bulk ionic strength, were demonstrated.

AB  - Theory suggests that the level of enrichment of O-18 above source water in plant organic material (Delta) may provide an integrative indicator of control of water loss. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of the processes affecting Delta. One such gap is the observed discrepancy between modeled enrichment of water at the sites of evaporation within the leaf and measured enrichment of the leaf water as a whole (Delta(L)). Farquhar and Lloyd (1993) suggested that this may be caused by a Peclet effect. It is also unclear whether organic material formed in the leaf reflects enrichment of water at the sites of evaporation within the leaf or Delta(L). To investigate this question castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) leaves, still attached to the plant, were sealed into a controlled-environment gas exchange chamber and subjected to a step change in leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference. Sucrose was collected from a cut on the petiole of the leaf in the chamber under equilibrium conditions and every hour for 6 h after the change in leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference. Oxygen isotope composition of sucrose in the phloem sap (Delta(suc)) reflected modeled Delta(L). A model is presented describing Delta(suc) at isotopic steady state, and accounts for 96% of variation in measured Delta(suc). The data strongly support the Peclet effect theory.

AB  - Forty-two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of the genera Lactobacillus (32), Leuconostoc (6), Pediococcus (3) and Lactococcus (1), isolated from Rioja red wines, were tested for antimicrobial activity. All these strains, as well as 18 Leuconostoc oenos and 19 yeast strains were used as indicators. Only nine strains showed antimicrobial activity, and all were of the species Lactobacillus plantarum, which constitutes the predominant microflora in Rioja red wines after alcoholic fermentation. Lact. plantarum strain J-51 showed the widest range of action, inhibiting the growth of 31 strains of the four studied LAB genera. Lact. plantarum J-51 antimicrobial activity was lost after treatment with proteases, suggesting a proteinaceous nature for this activity. It was found to be stable between pH 3 and 9 and under strong heating conditions (100 degrees C for 60 min). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of Lact. plantarum J-51 genome revealed the presence of the plnA gene that encodes the plantaricin precursor PlnA. A 366-bp fragment was sequenced and showed 95% identity with pln locus of Lact. plantarum C-11. The deduced precursor peptide sequence showed one mutation (Gly7 to Ser7) at the double glycine leader peptide, and the three putative 26-, 23- and 22-residue active peptides remain identical to those of Lact. plantarum C-11. Therefore, antimicrobial peptides constitute a potent adaptation advantage for those strains that dominate in a medium such as wine, and can play an important role in the ecology of wine microflora.

AB  - Many Vibrio species are capable of causing infections in humans. Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus are part of the normal microflora of estuaries and have been implicated in diseases from consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish. In the Great Bay Estuary of Maine and New Hampshire, oysters (Crassostea virginica) and soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) are harvested for commercial and recreational purposes. Only one incidence of V. parahaemolyticus infection from shellfish consumption has been documented. Traditional methods and a gene probe assay were used to enumerate V. vulnificus in water from sites along salinity gradients from two tributaries to the main water body (Great Bay) of the estuary. V. parahaemolyricus, Escherichia coli, enterococci, fecal coliforms, nitrate, ammonium, orthophosphate, suspended solids, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), temperature, and salinity were also measured. Results showed lower salinity and higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients, suspended solids, fecal indicator bacteria, and chlorophyll a in tributaries compared to Great Bay. Both Vibrio sp. were detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in the tributaries. Multiple regression analysis suggested suspended solids were the most significant variable, accounting for similar to 27% of the variance in V. vulnificus and V. parahaernolyticus concentrations. However, the gene probe results showed DOC was the most significant variable for explaining (44%) the variance in V. vulnificus concentrations. The results suggest that improved detection methods can enhance the understanding of environmental conditions conducive to both growth and inhibition of these pathogens.

AB  - Population decline of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis has been evaluated as a sensitive and reliable bioassay for assessing toxicity of marine sediment interstitial water. Three environmental conditions were examined using both interstitial and seawater cultures: (a) adverse effects from dissolved contaminant concentrations; (b) effects from particulate organic matter; and (c) increase or decrease of bacterial biomass from addition of mixtures of antibiotics. Three different parameters were measured to characterize decline: (i) time required for 50% of inoculated population to die (TL(50)); (ii) curve of the decline rate of Brachionus plicatilis (mu(BP)); and (iii) graphical area contained below plot of the egg:female ratio curve against time (A(BP)) Results indicated that, for each of the different assays, the three parameters of the Brachionus plicatilis population decline test were sensitive to concentrations of contaminants dissolved in interstitial waters (principally: total ammonia, Cu, Cr and alkylbenzenesulphonates) but not to particulate organic matter. Nevertheless, the presence or absence of mixed antibiotics with the contaminants may influence the Brachionus plicatilis population decline test, principally by retarding the hatching of eggs. Based on these results, Brachionus plicatilis is confirmed as an appropriate organism for use as an indicator of interstitial water contamination, using either decline rate, TL(50) or both parameters. The presence of particulate matter has no effect on these parameters, but the bacterial population may be an influence, although to a lesser extent than the toxicants.

TI  - SABAKI RIVER SEDIMENT LOAD AND CORAL STRESS - CORRELATION BETWEEN SEDIMENTS AND CONDITION OF THE MALINDI-WATAMU REEFS IN KENYA (INDIAN-OCEAN)
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Sediment discharges from rivers have a negative impact on coral reef ecosystems. Indicators of coral decline measured in the present study were: (1) injury to living stony corals; (2) soft coral cover; and (3) bare rocky substrate suitable for colonization by corals. The relationship between these indicators and the distribution of terrigenous sediment was studied for the Malindi-Watamu fringing reef complex along the Kenyan coast off East Africa during 1982 and 1983. Decline of this reef had been repeatedly noted during the preceding decade. The influence of terrigenous sediment from the Sabaki River appears to be strongest in the Watamu area in the south and in the northern-most part of the Malindi reef area. Correlations, between each of the above three coral stress response indicators, on the one hand, and quantitative indicators of sediment loading, on the other hand, were not clear. However, a combined coral stress indicator involving all three factors was shown to have a clear relationship with terrigenous sediment loading and provided a rapid means of field evaluation of the effects of sediment stress on stony corals. Values for the combined coral stress indicator were found to increase in proportion to increasing values of terrigenous sediment loads in both study areas. A higher coral stress indicator value means a high proportion of injured or algae infested corals, and/or a high soft coral cover, and/or a high proportion of rocky substrate suitable for, but unoccupied by, living corals.

AB  - The deep blue sky is an indicator of a lower concentration of aerosols and a cloudless sky. With increasing human emissions, a trend towards days with fewer deep blue skies might indicate a decline in a good living environment for humans. This study investigates the long-term changes of the deep blue sky in China from 1980 to 2018. Due to a lack of direct measurements, we use atmospheric visibility and low cloud cover to classify blue sky days into three grades: light blue day, medium blue day, and deep blue day. Climatologically, annual deep blue days increase from southeast China to northwest China, with the maximum number in Xinjiang and eastern Inner Mongolia and the minimum number in western Qinghai and southern Hebei. From 1980 to 2018, annual deep blue days show a prominent decreasing trend in most of China, with area-mean annual deep blue days decreasing by -0.48 days per year (d/y) in China, and the variation becomes more obvious after 2013. The maximum decreasing trend is observed in eastern China. The most prominent decreases of deep blue days are seen in winter. Both air pollution and the change in meteorological conditions contribute to the decrease of wintertime deep blue days in China. Specifically, the decrease in surface wind speed hinders the cleaning of air by winds, the increase in surface air temperature, and decrease in relative humidity is favorable for low cloud increase, and the increasing emission of pollution reduces atmospheric visibility.

AB  - The present review contains information on classification, sources and environmental risks of antibiotics entering the environment. A critical review of the main modern wastewater treatment methods of antibiotics removal is presented; their advantages and disadvantages are shown. The prospects and advantages of the photocatalytic method as the most efficient and economical useful are demonstrated. The antibiotics photocatalytic degradation mechanisms on the titanium dioxide surface and the influence of various factors on it are described. The efficiency of TiO2 co-doping in small concentrations, ratio of which is established experimentally for a real object, is shown. Structuring the photocatalyst allows to achieve a combination of high surface area and high density of available active centers. The optimal ratio of photocatalyst concentrations is recommended in the range of 0.5-1.0 g/L. It is shown that it is necessary to take into account the acid-base properties of the antibiotic and maintain the optimal pH to achieve a synergistic effect of dissociation, hydrolysis, and sorption properties of the photocatalyst during the antibiotics degradation. It is found that antibiotics with a stronger structure (sulfonamides and macrolides) will take longer to decompose than less chemically resistant (beta-lactam). This review allows selecting the optimal conditions for wastewater treatment from antibiotics using TiO2 based materials under UV or visible light irradiation with maximum efficiency.

AB  - The main goal of this article is to define the characteristics of and to evaluate the three selected models used to measure the performance of public administration bodies, with an emphasis placed on their application in different perspectives. The contemporary public administration institutions are obligated to increase their operating efficiency as well as the satisfaction of their stakeholders. This is precisely why they have been implementing diverse models, especially those already used for years in managing profit-oriented organisations. The models chosen for analysis are applied in public administration, making it possible to measure numerous indicators of both financial and nonfinancial nature. The research method adopted by the authors is a conceptual literature review performed using the resources of the Scopus, Springer, WoS, Emerald, and EBSCO databases. The items subject to analysis were the 3Es (i.e., economy, efficiency, effectiveness) and IOO (e.g., input, output, and outcome) models as well as the model included in the BSC (Balance Scorecard). The research has evidenced that each of the models has its strengths and limitations. The results thus obtained have led to a conclusion that the solution showing the highest potential in the area of the study is the performance measurement model proposed under the BSC; however, according to the authors, it still requires some fine-tuning to public administration's operating conditions and organisational culture. The article also highlights the fundamental operationalisation problems related to the subject in question.

AB  - Scholars and practitioners have considered Industry 4.0 a comprehensive set of emerging technologies that establish a new industrial perspective based on the "Internet of Things". As smart manufacturing is at the core of the Industry 4.0 concept, production planning and control (PPC) should play a key role in Industry 4.0 activities. Prior research has mainly focused on technological issues of Industry 4.0, while little is known about how PPC is influenced by digital capabilities and how it operates in this new context. We conduct a systematic literature review to develop an analytical framework that explains how PPC in the Industry 4.0 context is influenced by smart capabilities from five base technologies (Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Big Data and Analytics/Artificial Intelligence, and Additive Manufacturing), and how this is related to manufacturing system performance indicators, and environmental factors. The review includes studies from 2011 (when the Industry 4.0 concept was coined) to October 2019. Our findings provide a complete list of 18 smart capabilities (e.g., real-time capabilities, adaptability and dynamicity, visibility and traceability, autonomy, smart scheduling, PPC-as-a-service); 13 performance indicators (e.g., manufacturing flexibility, agility, reliability); and environmental factor conditions (e.g., product, demand, and manufacturing process). We also propose a future agenda with 10 research directions for PPC's study in the Industry 4.0 context.

AB  - Analysis of precipitation trends as well as the observed trends in precipitation concentration can be useful tools for the identification of natural hazards. This study aimed to analyze the trends in precipitation and precipitation concentration at the seasonal and annual levels in Mexico from 1960 to 2010. To do this, an entropy-based concentration index was used to calculate the concentration of precipitation at 44 climatological stations distributed throughout the country. The trend analysis was developed based on the Mann-Kendall test. There were fifteen significant precipitation trends at the annual level, and the numbers of positive and negative trends were nearly even. The interannual average of the concentration index ranged from 0.084 to 0.265, although extreme values of up to 0.56 were observed at the annual level and of up to 1 at the seasonal level. There were more positive trends than negative trends in the concentration index. The comparison of the trends of the precipitation and the concentration index showed an increase in precipitation at some stations with an associated decrease in the concentration index. On the other hand, decreases in precipitation at other stations were accompanied by increases in the concentration index. The first case did not seem to represent risk because the conditions suggested a more regular precipitation pattern. However, the second case could be considered a cautionary indicator, especially in the northern region, where it could signal the potential for drought.

In the era of nearly zero energy buildings, the embodied energy along with operational energy use are essential for evaluating the environmental impacts and building performance throughout their lifecycle. Key metrics and baselines for the embodied energy intensity in representative Hellenic houses are presented in this paper. The method is set up to progressively cover all types of buildings. The lifecycle analysis was performed using the well-established SimaPro software package and the EcoInvent lifecycle inventory database, complemented with national data from short energy audits carried out in Greece. The operational energy intensity was estimated using the national calculation engine for assessing the building's energy performance and the predictions were adapted to obtain more realistic estimates. The sensitivity analysis for different type of buildings considered 16 case studies, accounting for representative construction practices, locations (climate conditions), system efficiencies, renovation practices, and lifetime of buildings. The results were used to quantify the relative significance of operational and embodied energy, and to estimate the energy recovery time for popular energy conservation and energy efficiency measures. The derived indicators reaffirm the importance of embodied energy in construction materials and systems for new high performing buildings and for renovating existing buildings to nearly zero energy.

AB  - Soil health (SH) is important to the economics and environmental impacts of crop production, including coffee (Coffea spp.) culture.This study was conducted to gain insights into farmers' perceptions related to SH concepts and their realities on Colombian coffee farms.A total of 223 soil samples were collected from 145 coffee farms in Cauca, Colombia, that vary by municipality, their membership status with a coffee co-op (member or nonmember), and farmer gender. Samples were analyzed for 13 SH indicators, including wet aggregate stability (WAS), available water capacity (AWC), respiration rate, pH, active carbon (AC), organic matter (OM), protein, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn). Farmer co-op membership and municipality, but not farmer gender, were significant factors for SH status on farms. Farmer co-op members were asked to identify on their farms the plot that they perceived to have the highest soil fertility and the plot with the lowest soil fertility, which allowed for the evaluation of (1) the correctness of farmers' SH perception, i.e., whether their perception was aligned with or similar to scientific measurements of SH, and (2) which SH indicators strongly influence farmer perception of SH. Farmers' perceptions were found to be in line with the scientific laboratory measurements of SH, and their perceptions were significantly positively influenced by the soil's organic matter and protein contents but negatively influenced by soil respiration. Finally, SH perception correctness was not correlated with farmer gender, locality, or SH conditions.

AB  - Plants need an ideal and healthy soil condition for their growth and a sufficient amount of soil macronutrients. To determine soil nutrients, several methods have been widely employed. Yet, most of them are based on solvent extraction, which is normally time-consuming, requires complicated sample preparation, and sometimes involves chemical materials. Thus, a novel, fast and simultaneous method is required as an alternative method used to predict soil macronutrients in a short period and without involving chemical materials. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be considered for this need, since this method is fast, environmentally friendly, and non-destructive. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to apply an NIRS method to predict soil macronutrients (N, P, and K). The diffuse reflectance spectrum was acquired for soil samples in a wavelength range from 1000-2500 nm. Spectra data were corrected using a smoothing method whilst prediction models were developed using principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square regression (PLSR). Prediction accuracy and robustness were evaluated using these following statistical indicators: correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSEC) and residual predictive deviation (RPD). The results showed that NIRS was able to predict soil macronutrients simultaneously with a maximum correlation coefficient r = 0.97 for N prediction, r = 0.99 for P prediction, and r = 0.95 for K prediction. Thus, it may be concluded that an NIRS method is feasible to be applied as a novel, reliable and fast method to predict soil macronutrients (N, P, and K) simultaneously.

AB  - The article adresses an important issue that ties together the history of the Ministry of the Imperial Court, interactions between merchants and government, and history of palace towns, such as Tsarskoe Selo, Gatchina and Peterhof. Palace towns were exempt from gubernia administration and were governed by special structures within the Court Department. Drawing on materials from the Russian State Historical Archive, the author analyses the procedure for consideration of the private entrepreneurs' petitions on trade establishment in Peterhof in 1855-1860s. The article focuses on petitions rejected by local authorities and reformulated and readdressed to superior authority. Having studied different scenarios of interaction between Peterhof merchants and the Ministry of the Imperial Court officials, the author concludes that submitted applications were tried on their merits and refusals were supported by evidence. The Court Department officials checked proposed edifices for conformity with construction rules, took into account the nature of future enterprises, personal and business qualities of the applicants, and, in case of alcoholic products, estimated their influence on the public order. Negative response to first petition did not preclude other, which could be addressed either to the town administration or to superior bodies, all the way to the Court Department. Merchants who wished to open a new trade enterprise or to expand business used this opportunity to renew their petition. When they reformulated the essence of their request or expressed their readiness to satisfy conditions set by the authorities, entrepreneurs were granted their applications.

AB  - Fatigue is a body defensive measure, limiting the intensity and volume of effort. The intensity and volume of effort can be maintained at a high level only if the body's adaptability allows it.
   Measurement of fatigue is performed by measuring pulse and respiratory rate.
   The decisive factor in ensuring the success of an intervention and rescue operation in toxically or chemically aggressive environments resides in the optimal and efficient design of a training process for intervention personnel, correlated, amongst other things, with the evolution of pulse and oxygen saturation, which need to be monitored through an integrated system.
   Pulse is a physiological parameter commonly used in telemonitoring as it allows assessment of the rescuer's general condition, heart rhythm disturbances being recorded promptly and variations being easily differentiated between abnormal / normal. The parameter provides indications of cardiovascular function. Pulse sampling is performed automatically using devices that frequently use photometric plethysmography at the level of peripheral arteries as a measuring method.
   Blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) is a global indicator of blood oxygenation (the amount of oxygen bound to haemoglobin in arterial blood), being used in cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring.
   Within the paper, change in heart rate and blood oxygen saturation will be monitored, so as to determine the physical exertion of rescuers, using closed-circuit breathing apparatuses, as well as open-circuit breathing apparatuses, in confined spaces, ergometers, treadmill and ladders on different degrees of temperature and humidity.

AB  - Multiple changes are influencing work, workplaces and workers in the US including shifts in the main types of work and the rise of the 'gig' economy. Work and workplace changes have coincided with a decline in unions and associated advocacy for improved safety and health conditions. Risk assessment has been the primary method to inform occupational and environmental health policy and management for many types of hazards. Although often focused on one hazard at a time, risk assessment frameworks and methods have advanced toward cumulative risk assessment recognizing that exposure to a single chemical or non-chemical stressor rarely occurs in isolation. We explore how applying cumulative risk approaches may change the roles of workers and employers as they pursue improved health and safety and elucidate some of the challenges and opportunities that might arise. Application of cumulative risk assessment should result in better understanding of complex exposures and health risks with the potential to inform more effective controls and improved safety and health risk management overall. Roles and responsibilities of both employers and workers are anticipated to change with potential for a greater burden of responsibility on workers to address risk factors both inside and outside the workplace that affect health at work. A range of policies, guidance and training have helped develop cumulative risk assessment for the environmental health field and similar approaches are available to foster the practice in occupational safety and health.

AB  - This study purposed to determine endogenous enzymes, color parameters, phytochemicals, antioxidant capacity, indicator microbes and acceptability of litchi pulps in syrup after pasteurization (90 degrees C/5 min) and pressurization (100-600 MP/25 degrees C/20 min). The results showed that the polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities in litchi still remained after pressurization, while pasteurization completely inactivated both enzymes. Moreover, the levels of ascorbic acid, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols and antioxidant activities (DPPH and FRAP assays) in pressurized samples were significant higher than those in heated one. Also, pressurization could preserve the natural color better than pasteurization. The microbiological contamination was noticeably inhibited after pasteurization and pressurization at 400-600 MPa. Pressurized pulps were shown to have the liking scores apparently higher than pasteurized pulp. In overall, pressurization at 600 MPa was an appropriate condition for decreasing the PPO and POD activities as well as the indicator microbes of litchi pulps in syrup. During refrigerated storage, browning index (BI) of pressurized pulp (600 MPa) was higher than that of thermally treated pulp, while the degradation of the phytochemicals and antioxidant activities in both processed products were observed. However, residual levels of both endogenous enzymes and antioxidant properties in pressurized pulp were still higher than those of pasteurized pulp throughout the storage period.

AB  - The use of natural zeolite in agriculture has grown in the past 20 years, and it is neccessary to follow up on the soils on which it it applied to know its residual effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of five zoelite particle and dose sizes in the chemical properties of soils, N volatilization and foliar nutrient contents. Between the years 2010 to 2012, four experiments were carried out in 1.6 kg pots with a completely randomized design, five particle sizes (< 0.25, 0.25-0.50, 0.50-1.00, 1.00.-2.00, and 2.00-3.00 mm), and zeolite doses (0.00, 1.88, 4.74, 6.88 and 9.38 g kg(-1) of soil) and four replications. As an indicator plant, we used Rhodes grass (Chlorys gallane c.v Pioner). The soils evaluated were prepresentative of Cuba, allitic (Ultisol), pardos grisaceo and with carbonates (Inceptisoles), and humic siallitic (Molisol). The particle sizes of 1.00 to 3.00 mm inmproved the chemical conditions of the soils, and reduced N volatilization up to 57 %. Particles below 1 mm increased Na+ and K+ retention, which could improve soil despersal. The greatest doses of zeolite in the pardo grisaceo, pardo con carbonatos y humic siallitic soils increased the content of exchangeable bases in the soil, the dry mass yield, and the concentration of foliar nutrients. In contrast, no significant differences were found in the allitic soil for these agronomical variables.

AB  - Plant drought responses are still not fully understood. Improved knowledge on drought responses is, however, crucial to better predict their impact on individual plant and ecosystem functioning. Mechanistic models in combination with plant measurements are promising for obtaining information on plant water status and can assist us in understanding the effect of limiting soil water availability and drought stress. While existing models are reliable under sufficient soil water availability, they generally fail under dry conditions as not all appropriate mechanisms seem yet to have been implemented. We therefore aimed at identifying mechanisms underlying plant drought responses, and in particular investigated the behaviour of hydraulic resistances encountered in the soil and xylem for grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) and oak (Quercus robur L.). A variable hydraulic soil-to-stem resistance was necessary to describe plant drought responses. In addition, implementation of a variable soil-to-stem hydraulic resistance enabled us to generate an in situ soil-to-stem vulnerability curve, which might be an alternative to the conventionally used vulnerability curves. Furthermore, a daily recalibration of the model revealed a drought-induced increase in radial hydraulic resistance between xylem and elastic living tissues. Accurate information on plant hydraulic resistances and simulation of plant drought responses can foster important discussions regarding the functioning of plants and ecosystems during droughts.

AB  - Aim of study: To optimize an interpolation method and distribution of measured diameters to represent regular stem form of coniferous trees using a set of discrete points.
   Area of study: Central-Bohemian highlands, Czech Republic; a region that represents average stand conditions of production forests of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) in central Europe.
   Material and methods: The accuracy of stem curves modeled using natural cubic splines from a set of measured diameters was evaluated for 85 closely measured stems of Norway spruce using five statistical indicators and compared to the accuracy of three additional models based on different spline types selected for their ability to represent stem curves. The optimal positions to measure diameters were identified using an aggregate objective function approach.
   Main results: The optimal positions of the input points vary depending on the properties of each spline type. If the optimal input points for each spline are used, then all spline types are able to give reasonable results with higher numbers of input points. The commonly used natural cubic spline was outperformed by other spline types. The lowest errors occur by interpolating the points using the Catmull-Rom spline, which gives accurate and unbiased volume estimates, even with only five input points.
   Research highlights: The study contributes to more accurate representation of stem form and therefore more accurate estimation of stem volume using data obtained from terrestrial imagery or other close-range remote sensing methods.

AB  - Inherently, confined animal farming operations (CAFOs) and other intense fecal-rich environments are potential sources of groundwater contamination by enteric pathogens. The ubiquity of microbial matter poses unique technical challenges in addition to economic constraints when sampling wells in such environments. In this paper, we evaluate a groundwater sampling protocol that relies on extended purging with a portable submersible stainless steel pump and Teflon (R) tubing as an alternative to equipment sterilization. The protocol allows for collecting a large number of samples quickly, relatively inexpensively, and under field conditions with limited access to capacity for sterilizing equipment. The protocol is tested on CAFO monitoring wells and considers three cross-contamination sources: equipment, wellbore, and ambient air. For the assessment, we use Enterococcus, a ubiquitous fecal indicator bacterium (FIB), in laboratory and field tests with spiked and blank samples, and in an extensive, multi-year field sampling campaign on 17 wells within 2 CAFOs. The assessment shows that extended purging can successfully control for equipment cross-contamination, but also controls for significant contamination of the well-head, within the well casing and within the immediate aquifer vicinity of the well-screen. Importantly, our tests further indicate that Enterococcus is frequently entrained in water samples when exposed to ambient air at a CAFO during sample collection. Wellbore and air contamination pose separate challenges in the design of groundwater monitoring strategies on CAFOs that are not addressed by equipment sterilization, but require adequate QA/QC procedures and can be addressed by the proposed sampling strategy.

AB  - While marine organisms such as bivalves, seagrasses and macroalgae are commonly used as biomonitors for the environment pollution assessment, widely distributed sponges received little attention as potential helpful species for monitoring programmes. In this study, the trace element and radionuclide bioaccumulation and retention capacities of some marine sponges were estimated in a species-comparative study using radiotracers technique. Six Mediterranean species were exposed to background dissolved concentrations of Ag-110m, Am-241, Cd-109, Co-60. Cs-134, Mn-54, Se-75, Zn-65 allowing the assessment of the uptake and depuration kinetics for selected elements. Globally, massive demosponges Agelas oroides, Chondrosia reniformis and Ircinia variabilis displayed higher concentration factor (CF) than the erectile ones (Acanthella acuta, Cymbaxinella damicornis, Cymbaxinella verrucosa) at the end of exposure, suggesting that the morphology is a key factor in the metal bioaccumulation efficiency. Considering this observation, two exceptions were noted: (1) A. acuta reached the highest CF for Ag-110m and strongly retained the accumulated metal without significant Ag loss when placed in depuration conditions and (2) C. reniformis did not accumulate Se as much as A. oroides and I. variabilis. These results suggest that peculiar metal uptake properties in sponges could be driven by specific metabolites or contrasting biosilification processes between species, respectively. This study demonstrated that sponges could be considered as valuable candidate for biomonitoring metal contamination but also that there is a need to experimentally highlight metal-dependant characteristic among species.

AB  - During 2008, under a region-wide drought, there were a large number of simultaneous fires in the Parana River Delta region: the most affected vegetation was in marshes dominated by Schoenoplectus californicus (C.A.Mey.) Sojak or Cyperus giganteus Vahl. The objective of this paper was to study fire severity in terms of fire effect on vegetation cover and soil properties, and the recovery of those properties after one growing season, using optical remote sensing techniques and fieldwork data. To this aim, we performed unsupervised classification of Landsat TM imagery and conducted vegetation censuses and soil sampling in November 2008 and May 2009. Our results show that we could identify three fire severity classes: low severity, medium severity, and high severity. These classes are characterized by a remnant vegetation cover of approximately 75%, 25%, and 5%, respectively, and a diminution of soil organic carbon and nitrogen of 66% and 59% in the case of medium severity and high severity. Fire had almost no effect over pH and a slight effect on electrical conductivity. After one growing season, vegetation recovery is dependent on fire severity and hydrological condition, while soil properties did not show signs of recovery. This is one of the first studies of fire effects and recovery on fluvial herbaceous wetlands.

AB  - The coconut-based upland farming system of Capul, a small island municipality of Northern Samar was analyzed. The existing farming system in the area is combined with fishing, and these two activities serve as the main sources of livelihood of the Abaknons (the islanders of Capul). The paper examined the interrelationships of the island's present farming system of Abaknons and the coastal ecosystem productivity. Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection and analyses, the impacts of upland farming on the coastal ecosystem were assessed employing indicators such as sediment load, run-off water quality, seagrass net primary productivity and fish productivity. Population increase in the island after World War II led to the complete loss of its forest cover with consequent loss of biodiversity. The forest was replaced with coconut-based subsistence farming system. The present condition of the coastal ecosystem of the island is still good as shown by the increased seagrass subsystem net primary productivity, clear visibility of coastal water at a depth of 4-6 m at high tide during the rainy season, presence of Cymodocea seagrass species - an indicator of low sediment deposition, good fish productivity, and high fish diversity at the seagrass subsystem. All these evidences show that the present farming system has minimal negative impact on the coastal ecosystem. However, the coastal water has high coliform contamination from unhygienic and unsanitary practices of the coastal residents.

AB  - The aim of this work was to find new sources of resistance to chocolate spot disease, and to validate their stability across different environments. In order to do so, a collection of 307 accessions of Vicia faba was screened for resistance to Botrytis fabae under field conditions; stability of resistance of the 40 most-resistant accessions was tested in a multi-location experiment in Austria, Chile, Egypt, France and Spain over two field seasons. Although complete resistance was not found, nine accessions showed interesting levels of incomplete resistance (ranging from 10 to 20% of average severity across environments, maximum average severity being 47.9%). Genotype x environment interaction accounted for 22% of the sum of squares of the multi-environment evaluation, revealing instability of the phenotypic expression across environments. This usually hampers the efficiency of selection and reduces the adaptability of the plant material. Three accessions stand out for their consistent resistance, both in terms of reduced disease severity and high stability, which make them good candidates for breeding programs. As for environments, those with the highest total severity mean were the most discriminant between accessions. In contrast, those with lower severity means were the most representative of the whole range of environments. It can be concluded that validation of resistance to chocolate spot in different environments is an essential step when screening for material of interest and should be taken into account for further works.

AB  - Reliable models of enzyme kinetics are required for the effective design of bioconversion processes. Kinetic expressions of the enzyme-catalysed reaction rate however, are frequently complex and establishing accurate values of kinetic parameters normally requires a large number of experiments. These can be both time consuming and expensive when working with the types of non-natural chiral intermediates important in pharmaceutical syntheses. This paper presents ail automated microscale approach to the rapid and cost effective generation of reliable kinetic models useful for bioconversion process design. It incorporates a model driven approach to the experimental design that minimises the number of experiments to be performed, while still generating accurate values of kinetic parameters. The approach has been illustrated with the transketolase mediated asymmetric synthesis of L-erythrulose. Experiments were performed using automated microwell studies at the 150 or 800 mu L scale. The derived kinetic parameters were then verified in a second round of experiments where model predictions showed excellent agreement with experimental data obtained under conditions not included in the original experimental design.]it comparison with conventional methodology, the modelling approach enabled a nearly 4-fold decrease in the number of experiments while the microwell experimentation enabled a 45-fold decrease in material requirements and a significant increase in experimental throughput. The approach is generic and could be applied to a wide range of enzyme catalysed bioconversions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agri-environmental measures are among the most important instruments for the promotion of environmentally adapted agricultural land use. While their pertinence in Europe has been increasing for some years, evaluations of these measures have shown that their design is still lacking in both effectiveness and efficiency. This paper describes the derivation of indicator plant species that make it possible to implement result-oriented remuneration schemes in the grassland sector. In many ways, result-oriented agri-environmental schemes can be expected to prove superior to the measure-oriented schemes which are currently most widely used.
   It is demonstrated how a checklist of indicator species can be derived by using expert knowledge and statistical crosschecks with a database of pre-existing vegetation samples. These species are indicators for conservationally relevant, agriculturally usable grassland on moderately dry to moderately wet sites. The qualities that make a site eligible for remuneration are defined by societal demand as expressed through political objectives and guidelines. One of the challenges in deriving an indicator checklist was to represent quality through species that not only satisfy scientific criteria like validity, but are also operational within remuneration programmes. For example, operational indicator species have to be easily identifiable. The checklist of indicator species for result-oriented remuneration in the Land Brandenburg presented here covers the entire spectrum of site conditions and all types of usable grassland in Brandenburg.

AB  - The biology and fishery of the lobster, Palinurus elephas from the SW coast of Portugal was studied during two distinct periods 10 years apart in 1993-1994 (March 93 to March 94) and during 2003 (May to July). The landings at the port of Sagres, representing half of the catch of the country for this species, were sampled twice a week. The ovigerous season extends from September to March, with an individual incubation period of five months. Considering the ovigerous condition as an indicator of maturity in females, 50% of the females were mature at carapace length of 110 mm. Females below this size represent 95% of the population and account for 41% of the egg production. Females above 50% maturity, representing only 5% of the population, provide 59% of the eggs, showing the importance of larger individuals in the reproduction of this species. Most biological parameters estimated are within the range of values reported for this species in other areas with the exception that in our study the total length was smaller in relation to carapace length, so that females of a given carapace length carried fewer eggs. Parameters were estimated for the following relationships: total length and carapace length, weight and carapace length, weight and total length, maturity at size (carapace length) and fecundity at size (carapace length). It is suggested that a set of measures including catch control, effort control, gear control and protected areas are combined to allow the recovery of this resource.

AB  - Sipha flava is a serious pest in sugarcane in southern Florida, so efforts in better understanding its biology were initiated. Development, longevity, and fecundity of alate and apterous S. flava (Forbes) feeding on Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench., cultivar 'Kow Chow,' were examined under near-ambient temperature and lighting conditions within a glasshouse. After examining several body dimensions during apterous aphid development (antennal length, head width, body length, and abdominal width), antennal length was found to be the best indicator of an instar. Apterous aphids completed development from nymph to adult in approximate to8 d and passed through four instars. A comparison between the sizes of apterous and alate morphs indicated that apterous females were larger and weighed more than the alates. Both morphs survived equally as long during reproduction (21 d) but produced slightly different numbers of nymphs over their life (apterous = 54.3, alate = 48.2). During the first 8 d of reproduction, apterous adults produced 3.3 nymphs/d and alates produced 2.3 nymphs/d. However, during the following 8 d, nymphal production by apterous females dropped to 2.7 nymphs/d but increased to 2.9 nymphs/d by alates. The estimated intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) for apterous aphids was 0.314. The net reproductive rates (R-o) for alate and apterous adults based on 0% nymphal mortality were 45.80 and 53.09 and for 21% nymphal mortality were 36.3 and 41.9, respectively.

AB  - The rupture of the Funda similar to o mining dam (Doce river basin, Brazil) caused a wide range of negative impacts. Yet, assemblage-level implications to estuarine and coastal fishes remain unclear, partly due to the lack of pre-disaster information. Based on monthly otter trawl surveys, we analyzed spatial and seasonal variability in univariate (total biomass, biomass of species vulnerable to exploitation, rarefied richness and evenness) and multivariate (species composition and trophic composition) indicators of fish biodiversity in the Doce river delta, eastern Brazil. We determined the independent and interactive effects of environmental, seasonal and spatial variables on species composition to test whether environmental alterations provoked by mine tailings could affect assemblage's organization. Most indicators present idiosyncratic spatiotemporal patterns, suggesting they have complementary roles in revealing changes in fish biodiversity. Environmental variables, including those affected by the Funda similar to o dam collapse such as turbidity, dissolved oxygen and pH, were much more important than seasonal and spatial predictors in explaining the variation in fish species composition. These findings highlight the potential from mine tailings to disrupt local ichthyofauna and indicate a preponderant role of environmental conditions in assemblage structuring. Given the lack of data prior to rupture, our results may be used as a baseline against which to assess temporal trends in fish biodiversity relative to changes detected in less disturbed estuarine and coastal assemblages.

AB  - The development of civilization contributed to the exponential growth in the production of plastics. Policy of the, so-called, "European Green Deal" places particular emphasis on reducing the use of plastics through various mechanisms, including their reuse, recycling and, in particular, the development of new biodegradable and compostable plastics. In order to check if plastics are suitable for biodegradability and compostability they must undergo a series of tests in accordance with applicable standards. The biodegradation test procedures are very general and allow for the use of different temperatures of the biodegradation process in the test. The aim of the research was to evaluate the influence of temperature on the biodegradation process of selected packaging materials. The obtained results show a significant influence of the temperature of the biodegradation process of all 3 tested types of packaging materials: oxy-biodegradable, corn starch and paper. Statistically significant differences in the biodegradation rate of the tested packaging materials were demonstrated in as low as 40 degrees C, despite the low intensity of the process. As the process temperature increased to 45 and 50 degrees C, a statistically significant increase in CO2 productions was recorded. CO2 is produced by the degradation of polymers and is an indicator for this process. At 50 degrees C, the highest decomposition rate, resulting in the highest CO2 production, was recorded in the case of corn starch films. Oxy-biodegradable material showed worst degradation potential what excludes it from composting processes.

AB  - The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster continue to threaten humans and ecosystems across fallout gradient in Northern Ukraine and nearby. Forest ecosystems contain substantial stocks of long-lived radionuclide Sr-90 which was leached from the fuel matrix during the disaster. Nowadays, there is a lack of information about current transfer factors (TF) of this radionuclide from soil to the stemwood of native tree species. We have estimated Sr-90 content in the forest stemwood of three tree species utilizing models of their growth and yield and collected woody samplings. TFs provided here vary greatly across studied tree species (18.0 x 2.1(+/- 1), 8.7 x 2.8(+/- 1), and 10.4 x 6.0(+/- 1)n x 10(-3) m(2)kg(-1) (geometrical mean (GM) +/- geometrical standard deviation, GSD) for the above species, respectively) and together with indicators of soil contamination allow us to reliably assess local stocks in the stemwood. Silver birch stands are estimated to deposit the highest Sr-90 stocks. Herewith, at 25 years old Black alder stands could accumulate higher stocks (up to 35 MBqha(-1)) under rich growth conditions. TFs obtained in this study substantially exceed values provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency for studied tree species and thus could entail respective restrictions on use of firewood across large areas in Ukrainian Polissya. Data provided here may be harnessed to support decisions of respective stakeholders to provide credibly safe management of the contaminated forest ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding soil health condition is essential to the sustainability and stability of the entire ecosystem of farmland. The primary objective of this study was to improve the soil health index (SHI) based on principle component analysis (PCA) and develop a new analysis method for soil health assessment based on Meta-Analytic Hierarchy Process (Meta-AHP), which provides consistent minimum data sets (MDS), weight and scoring function for different locations, studies and management. The thirteen variables of MDS that exhibited sensitivity to management between organic and conventional soil were selected by meta-analysis. The indicator weight was assigned by a combination of experts scoring, AHP and meta-analysis. To test the applicability and sensitivity of the soil health assessment by Meta-AHP, a sixteen-year long-term test was assessed by the conventional SHI method (cSHI) and Meta-AHP. The results showed that similar evaluation results and significant positive correlations (** P < 0.01, n = 9) between the two evaluated methods were observed, and the results calculated using Meta-AHP had the best discrimination under different plant systems due to the higher F values when compared with the cSHI. This study developed a sensitive and consistent SH assessment framework that can be used applied to a variety of location, study, and soil management systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aims: To identify the beech forest types in southwestern Poland and the main environmental gradients affecting their species composition. Study area: SW Poland. Methods: Vegetation types of beech forests were identified using the modified TWINSPAN algorithm, whereas unconstrained (DCA) and constrained (CCA) ordination methods were applied to identify the main environmental gradients shaping the plant communities. An initial dataset of 920 phytosociological releves collected by the authors was numerically classified and geographically stratified and the resulting dataset of 670 releves was subjected to further analyzes. Results: We distinguished eight vegetation units identified as the associations Calamagrostio arundinaceae-Fagetum sylvaticae Sykora 1971, Deschampsio flexuosae-Fagetum sylvaticae Schroder 1938, Luzulo luzuloidis-Fagetum sylvaticae Meusel 1937, Calamagrostio villosae-Fagetum sylvaticae Mikyska 1972, Poo chaixii-Fagetum sylvaticae Somsak 1979, Cephalanthero damasonii-Fagetum sylvaticae Oberdorfer 1957, Galio odorati-Fagetum sylvaticae Sougnez et Thill 1959 and Hordelymo europaei-Fagetum sylvaticae Kuhn 1937. The species composition is mainly influenced by elevation-related temperature gradient and the type of bedrock. The observed environmental patterns were further supported by the significant differences in Ellenberg indicator values for soil reaction and temperature among the syntaxa. Conclusions: Our study provides a new survey of beech forest vegetation in southwestern Poland. The vegetation units defined by unsupervised numerical classification correspond to current classifications of Central European beech forests. They are distributed over the same range of environmental conditions as throughout the rest of Central Europe, while they also reflect the local floristic and environmental patterns.

AB  - A review has been made to understand the hydrogeochemical behaviour of groundwater through statistical analysis of long term water quality data (year 2005-2013). Water Quality Index (WQI), descriptive statistics, Hurst exponent, fractal dimension and predictability index were estimated for each water parameter. WQI results showed that majority of samples fall in moderate category during 2005-2013, but monitoring site four falls under severe category (water unfit for domestic use). Brownian time series behaviour (a true random walk nature) exists between calcium (Ca2+) and electric conductivity (EC); magnesium (Mg2+) with EC; sodium (Na+) with EC; sulphate (SO42-) with EC; total dissolved solids (TDS) with chloride (Cl-) during pre-(2005-2013) and post-(2006-2013) monsoon season. These parameters have a closer value of Hurst exponent (H) with Brownian time series behaviour condition (H = 0.5). The result of times series analysis of water quality data shows a persistent behaviour (a positive autocorrelation) that has played a role between Cl-and Mg2+, Cl-and Ca2+, TDS and Na+, TDS and SO42-, TDS and Ca2+ in pre- and post-monsoon time series because of the higher value of H (> 1). Whereas an anti-persistent behaviour (or negative autocorrelation) was found between Cl-and EC, TDS and EC during pre-and post-monsoon due to low value of H. The work outline shows that the groundwater of few areas needs treatment before direct consumption, and it also needs to be protected from contamination.

AB  - Barbula fallax Hedw., Erythrodontium julaceum (Schwaegr.) Par., and Bryum argenteum Hedw. are typical rock mosses growing on rocks in different terrestrial habitats. In this study, B. fallax and E. julaceum, which are epilithic mosses growing in rock desertification in Guizhou, China, were used as ecophysiological mosses in a combination of field investigations and laboratory experiments. We also investigated the reference moss B. argenteum, which is a widely distributed moss in habitats with soil as substrate. Our research focused on the response of the antioxidant defense system of epilithic mosses to drought stress. Most antioxidant defense indicators increased initially, then declined at later stages of drought stress. In contrast, the carotenoid content increased constantly. In addition, there was an initial increase (albeit variable) in relative membrane permeability, with this parameter showing a parabolic trend in all of the epilithic mosses. Among the three species, E. julaceum demonstrated the strongest resistance followed by B. fallax and then by B. argenteum. The epilithic mosses displayed stronger resistance compared to the native mosses; the increase in O (2) (-center dot) content and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the early stage of drought stress induced the enzymatic and non-enzymatic scavenging systems to sequester ROS. Moreover, the radical scavenging ability and strong drought tolerance was maintained. The long-term growth of bryophyte under drought conditions in a karst environment can help eliminate the intense response of mosses to drought stress as they adapt.

AB  - Urban parks are community assets, providing people places to play and rest. Access to parks in urban environments promotes social equity and improves quality of life for surrounding neighborhoods. In this context, social equity is related to accessibility, i.e. the possibility of walking or biking from home to a public park, giving people who do not have access to a variety of entertainment an option that is a public good. This paper examines the spatial distribution of urban parks in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, and how it relates to the socio-economic conditions of surrounding neighborhoods. Curitiba is known for its urban parks; however, no systematic study has been conducted to verify which neighborhoods enjoy park access within walking distance and what the socio-economic differences are between the better and worse served neighborhoods. In addition, we investigate if access to green open space has improved between the last two decennial census, a period marked by unprecedented socio-economic affluence in Brazil. Research questions, to be addressed using spatial analysis, focus on equitable distribution, and spatial evolution of parks and social equity. Variables include measurable walking distances from census tracts to parks, income data from the 2000 and 2010 Brazilian decennial censuses, and qualitative data of urban parks in Curitiba. Findings offer recommendations for future implementation of additional parks in Curitiba so that all areas of the city have adequate green open space and all citizens have equal access to recreation and leisure opportunities.

AB  - Genotype by Environment Interaction (GEI) was investigated on grain yield of 10 rice genotypes in 12 lowland rice growing environments in the Philippines. Biplots were used in selecting and recommending the top-performing genotypes on different environments. Additive Main Effect and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) and Genotype by Genotype Environment (GGE) models were used in the analyses. The ANOVA for grain yield was significant (P<0.05) for genotypes, environments and their interaction. Environments accounted for the greater proportion (80.73%) of variation in grain yield, followed by GEI (12.80%), and genotypes (6.69%), indicating the need for multi-year and multi-location testing of rice varieties. The first two terms of the AMMI models explained 62.10% of the GEI while GGE biplot analysis accounted for 72.4 % of the total GEI variation. Based on AMMI and GGE biplots, no single variety has superior performance across environments. However, G2 (PSB Rc82) and G5 (PR37273-5-16-5-2-1-2-1) were the best genotypes having high and stable yields. The GGE model identified Nueva Viscaya State University as the most discriminating environment, while Naujan, Oriental Mindoro as the most representative environment. These environments are good test environments for selecting adapted genotypes. In this study both AMMI and GGE biplots were evaluated as effective tools for the analysis of GEI and visualization of genotype performance under varying test environments. Findings in this study are useful inputs in breeding rice varieties that are adapted to certain recommendation domains.

AB  - The present study uses stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (delta(15)Nand delta C-13) as trophic indicators for Atlantic bluefin tuna larvae (BFT) (6-10 mm standard length) in the highly contrasting environmental conditions of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and the Balearic Sea (MED). These regions are differentiated by their temperature regime and relative productivity, with the GOM being significantly warmer and more productive. MED BFT larvae showed the highest delta N-15 signatures, implying an elevated trophic position above the underlying microzooplankton baseline. Ontogenetic dietary shifts were observed in the BFT larvae from the GOM and MED which indicates early life trophodynamics differences between these spawning habitats. Significant trophic differences between the GOM and MED larvae were observed in relation to delta N-15 signatures in favour of the MED larvae, which may have important implications in their growth during their early life stages. These low delta N-15 levels in the zooplankton from the GOM may be an indication of a shifting isotopic baseline in pelagic food webs due to diatrophic inputs by cyanobacteria. Lack of enrichment for delta N-15 in BFT larvae compared to zooplankton implies an alternative grazing pathway from the traditional food chain of phytoplankton-zooplankton-larval fish. Results provide insight for a comparative characterization of the trophic pathways variability of the two main spawning grounds for BFT larvae.

AB  - Assuring the well-being of children has emerged over the past several decades as an important goal for health and social policymakers. Although the concept of child well-being has been operationalized and measured in different ways by different child-serving entities, there are few unifying theories that could undergird and inform these various conceptual and measurement efforts. In this paper, we attempt to construct a theory of child well-being. We first review the social and policy history of the concept of child well-being, and briefly review its measurement based on these conceptualizations. We then examine three types of theories of well-being extant in philosophy-mental states theories, desire-based theories and needs-based theories-and investigate their suitability to serve as prototypes of a theory of child well-being. We develop a constraint that child well-being is important in and of itself and not merely as a way station to future adult well-being (we call this a non-reduction constraint). Using this constraint, we identify the limitations of each of the three sets of theories to serve as a basis for a theory of child well-being. Based on a developmentalist approach, we then articulate a theory of child well-being that contains two conditions. First, a child's stage-appropriate capacities that equip her for successful adulthood, given her environment; and, second, an engagement with the world in child-appropriate ways. We conclude by reviewing seven implications of this theoretical approach for the measurement of child well-being.

AB  - In this study, well-preserved leaf-blade compressions and impressions from shale levels in the Fonseca Formation (Priabonian/Rupelian of the Fonseca Basin, state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil) and associated epiphyllous fungi are described. Based on leaf architecture and indumentum, a new species is established, assigned to the extant tropical genus Terminalia L. (Combretaceae). The leaf of Terminalia palaeopubescens sp. nov. is mesophyll, narrow obovate and with an entire margin. Its secondary veins are camptodromous-brochidodromous, the tertiary pattern is percurrent mixed predominantly alternate, the quaternaries are alternate percurrent and the higher orders regular polygonal reticulate, with small and well developed areoles. Trichomes are present in the indumentum and are simple, slender, pointed, and with a swollen base, typical of the Combretaceae. Epyphyllous fungi, in the shape of microthyrioid disks of variable size and profusely colonizing the leaf surface, were assigned to Callimothallus Dilcher (Microthyriaceae). The presence of those biogenic structures (besides Phragmothyrites Edwards, already reported in the same levels of the Fonseca Formation) indicates that a prominent leaf mycoflora was associated to the vegetation, probably sustained by warm and humid conditions. The data here presented, analyzed together with other taxonomic, taphonomic and foliar physiognomic indicators, lead to the hypothesis that a dense rainforest, supported by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, was thriving near the banks and floodplain environments associated to fluvial systems of the Fonseca Formation, during the Eocene/Oligocene transition, in southeastern Brazil.

AB  - In the aftermath of a release of microbiological agents, environmental sampling must be conducted to characterize the release sufficiently so that mathematical models can then be used to predict the subsequent dispersion and human health risks. Because both the dose-response and environmental transport of aerosolized microbiological agents are functions of the effective aerodynamic diameter of the particles, environmental assessments should consider not only the total amount of agents but also the size distributions of the aerosolized particles. However, typical surface sampling cannot readily distinguish among different size particles. This study evaluates different approaches to estimating risk from measurements of microorganisms deposited on surfaces after an aerosol release. For various combinations of sampling surfaces, size fractions, HVAC operating conditions, size distributions of release spores, uncertainties in surface measurements, and the accuracy of model predictions are tested in order to assess how much detail can realistically be identified from surface sampling results. The recommended modeling and sampling scheme is one choosing 3, 5, and 10 mu m diameter particles as identification targets and taking samples from untracked floor, wall, and the HVAC filter. This scheme provides reasonably accurate, but somewhat conservative, estimates of risk across a range of different scenarios. Performance of the recommended sampling scheme is tested by using data from a large-scale field test as a case study. Sample sizes of 10-25 in each homogeneously mixed environmental compartment are sufficient to develop order of magnitude estimates of risk. Larger sample sizes have little benefit unless uncertainties in sample recoveries can be reduced.

AB  - Methanogen populations and their domains are poorly understood; however, in recent years, research on this topic has emerged. The relevance of this field has also been enhanced by the growing economic interest in methanogen skills, particularly the production of methane from organic substrates. Management attention turned to anaerobic wastes digestion because the volume and environmental impact reductions. Methanogenesis is the biochemically limiting step of the process and the industrially interesting phase because it connects to the amount of biogas production. For this reason, several studies have evaluated the structure of methanogen communities during this process. Currently, it is clear that the methanogen load and diversity depend on the feeding characteristics and the process conditions, but not much data is available. In this study, we apply a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method based on mcrA target to evaluate, by specific probes, some subgroups of methanogens during the mesophilic anaerobic digestion process fed wastewater sludge and organic fraction of the municipal solid waste with two different pre-treatments. The obtained data showed the prevalence of Methanomicrobiales and significantly positive correlation between Methanosarcina and Methanosaetae and the biogas production rate (0.744 p < 0.01 and 0.641 p < 0.05). Methanosarcina detected levels are different during the process after the two pre-treatment of the input materials (T-test p < 0.05). Moreover, a role as diagnostic tool could be suggested in digestion optimisation.

AB  - Salicylate hydroxylase (SHL) catalyzes the production of catechol (plus CO2 and H2O) from salicylate, NADH, and O-2. Coimmobilization of SHL with a NAD(P)(+)-dependent dehydrogenase in front of a Clark-type oxygen electrode has been investigated in the development of a general type of dehydrogenase-based biosensors that can detect various biological analytes; however, currently, no fluorophores are available for these applications. We synthesized the first new long-wavelength latent fluorogenic substrate SHLF (3) for SHL. In the presence of NADH and under aerobic conditions, SHL catalyzes the decarboxylative hydroxylation of SHLF followed by a quinone- methide-type rearrangement reaction concomitant with the ejection of a fluorescence coumarin 2, which is spontaneous and irreversible at physiological temperatures in aqueous media. The fluorescence signal generated by this process is specific and, in the near red spectral region with an emission maximum at 595 nm, is suppressed by salicylic acid. The fluorescence response of SHLF is insensitive to various biological reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reductants. Furthermore, SHLF is a sensitive fluorimetric indicator for analyte determination in the SHL-coupled dehydrogenase assay in which NAD+ is converted to NADH. This novel fluorescence assay detected 3-hydroxybutyrate and cholesterol in the nanomolar range and is more sensitive than the current SHL dehydrogenase amperometric sensors, making it applicable to the construction of a fiber-optic fluorescence biosensor for clinical diagnostic uses.

AB  - The impact of chronic urban air pollution on asthma and allergy remains controversial, probably because exposure is difficult to evaluate. In this cross-sectional epidemiological survey of 9- to 11-year-old children living in six French towns, levels of air pollution were estimated by using dispersion models that take into account background air pollution levels along with traffic density, topography and meteorological conditions. We estimated three-year exposure, in the school environment, to benzene, volatile organic compounds, SO2 particles less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), nitrous oxides (NO2 and NOx) and CO, which are the main urban air pollutants. Several health indicators were gathered by means of a questionnaire, a physical examination, skin prick testing, and measurement of peak-flow variations following an exercise test. Among the nearly 5000 children who had been living in the survey area for at least three years, the 12-month and cumulative prevalence rates of asthma and exercise-induced hyper-reactivity correlated with estimated levels of benzene, SO2, PM10, NOx and CO. The 12-month and cumulative prevalence rates of atopic dermatitis correlated with estimated benzene, PM10, NO2, NOx and CO levels. Pollen sensitization correlated with benzene and PM10 levels, and the cumulative prevalence of allergic rhinitis correlated with the PM10 level. These associations remained statistically significant among children who had spent their entire lives in the same community

AB  - Pedogenic carbonates in arid and semi-arid regions of the world have a great significance as palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological indicators and form a major pool in the carbon cycle. We analysed the ultra-microfabric and the stable isotope composition of C and O in pedogenic carbonates in colluvial soils derived from limestone in an arid region of central Iran. Our objective was to determine the conditions for the formation of soft pedogenic carbonate nodules and their co-existence with palygorskite in the palaeo-argillic horizon. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the calcite aggregates were matted with palygorskite. Ultra-microtome cuts, examined using transmission electron microscopy, provided more detailed information about the fundamental particle association of secondary carbonates and palygorskite. Although less abundant, other silicate clays were detected in both the acid-insoluble clay fractions and in ultra-cuts, mostly in fine clay size, suggesting the engulfing of palygorskite by growing calcite or illuviation of palygorskite during or after formation of the calcite. Coatings of illuvial clays on calcite crystals support the hypothesis that palygorskite was trapped by pedogenic carbonate when the climate was wetter than it is today to form an argillic horizon. However, electron microscopic evidence of the occurrence of fibres on the immediate pedogenic carbonate particle surfaces suggests the in situ formation of palygorskite. The delta(13)C and delta(18)O values of pedogenic carbonates suggest that these carbonates were formed in an environment with more available moisture and more C4 plants than now.

AB  - The Central Himalayan region is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and characterized by regional climatic conditions. The livelihood of the mountain communities across the Himalaya is at risk owing to the consequences of variable precipitation patterns. There exists limited empirical research on precipitation variability due to inadequate hydro-meteorological stations at highaltitude regions. The study uses a novel methodology which integrates precipitation variability with resource sensitivity over the three verticals of Central Himalaya: Himadri, Himachal and Shivaliks and across four major river basins: Yamuna, Upper Ganga, Ghaghar and Ramganga. The magnitude of the significant precipitation trends was estimated through time series analysis at a 95% confidence interval. To assess the sensitivity of natural resources (forest, water and land) and human resources, fourteen mountain-specific indicators were identified which captured resource index using data standardization and principal component analysis. Sen's slope and Resource index were plotted in a 2D Cartesian coordinate to draw precipitation-resource quadrants with their effective coverage area: High Precipitation and Scarce Resources (35.92%); Low Precipitation and Abundant Resources (30.10%); Low Precipitation and Scarce Resources (22.33%) and High Precipitation and Abundant Resources (11.65%). This helped in developing quadrant-specific adaptation strategies under regional variability of precipitation. The methodology and the research findings will certainly assist water experts, resource managers and policy makers to strengthen adaptive capacity and improve the resilience of vulnerable communities across Himalaya.

AB  - This study was conducted on the Ngaoundaba Crater Lake sediments to infer provenance, weathering conditions, organic matter accumulation, and trace metal concentrations. Ngaoundaba Lake sediments were collected using a manual core sampler at 5 to 8 m water depth. Two sediment cores from the littoral and center of the lake were analyzed for grain size distribution, water content (WC), organic matter content, mineralogy, and major and trace element concentrations. The Ngaoundaba sediments were classified as silt and sandy silt. Sediments show high content in organic matter, which is more to the littoral than to the center of the lake, varying from 14.6% to 24% and 21.2% to 40.8%, respectively. The grain surface features identified by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) show both chemical and mechanical microtextures with sub-rounded to angular shape suggesting both proximal and distal sources. The lake sediments are composed of quartz, kaolinite, and hematite, with low amounts of feldspars, rutile, calcite, illite, and ilmenite. Weathering indices such as the chemical index of alteration (CIA), chemical index of weathering (CIW), and index of compositional variability (ICV) indicate moderate to intense chemical weathering in the source area and immature to mature sediments. The geochemical composition indicates that the sediments were derived from felsic to intermediate igneous rocks, such as granitoids, and mafic alkali lavas like basanites. The environmental risk assessment of trace metals obtained by enrichment factor (EF) and geo-accumulation index (I-geo) shows low contamination of the lake sediments.

AB  - Indoor airborne fungi have been associated with adverse human health effects. Therefore, it is important to understand the causes of underlying variation in airborne fungi in indoor environments. This study consequently aimed to investigate the association between indoor fungi with temporal variation, environmental parameters, and potential confounders over 10 months in four library rooms using Andersen samplers. Indoor fungal concentrations peaked in October and were lowest in March in both stack rooms, whereas the highest concentrations in both reading rooms were observed in September with lowest concentrations in July. Nonparametric analyses revealed higher fungal concentrations in the rooms that were significantly associated with relative humidity >= 60%, PM2.5 >= 35 mu g/m(3), number of people >= 16, open windows, working air conditioners, and room area < 400 m(2). Multiple linear regression modeling for the library building considering only continuous variables revealed that relative humidity, PM2.5, and the number of people were significant predictors of fungal concentrations. Additionally, the model with continuous and categorical variables suggested that relative humidity, PM2.5, the number of people, ceiling fan condition, window state, and air conditioner operating status were significant predictor variables of concentrations. Outdoor fungal concentrations were a significant predictor for the two models of indoor fungal concentrations for each room. Ceiling fan or air conditioner operation was associated with altered fungal particle concentrations. These results provide a deeper understanding of indoor air fungal quality.

AB  - The high-gravity rotating packed bed (HiGee RPB) developed here can simultaneously remove multiple air pollutants using alkaline solution, thus achieving the flue gas deep purification. The electric-arc-furnace reduction slag (EAFRS) leachate was then used as the alkaline absorbent in HiGee RPB for assessing the removal efficiencies of nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matters (PM) from flue gas. The results indicated the changes to the CO2 capture was enhanced by increasing the initial PH value of the alkaline solution. In contrast, this value has no significant influence on NOx removal. The suitable NOx removal efficiency ranged from 90.9% to 97.09% at the liquid-to-gas (L/G) ratio of 0.01 and high gravity factor of 58.9 to 368. The precipitated calcium carbonate gained from carbonation via HiGee process exhibited similar physical properties to commercial products. In addition, 95.9% of PM removal efficiency was achieved at the L/G ratio and high gravity factor of 0.03 and 235.4, respectively. This treatment furthermore demonstrated a high efficiency for PM collection of over 90% and balanced the energy consumption. Based on the result, an Aspen simulation and a preliminary cost-benefit analysis were carried out to develop a mass-balance model for this system and determine the favorable operating conditions.

AB  - Waste activated sludge requires effective dewatering, high biological stability and retention of nutrients prior to disposal for agricultural application. The study was conducted to evaluate the impact of pressure-driven electro-dewatering (EDW) on improving sludge characteristics related to disposal in agriculture, including biological stability, pathogen availability, heavy metals concentrations and nutrients content. Thickened conditioned and mechanically dewatered sludge samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), characterized by different stabilization processes, and treated by a lab-scale device at 5, 15 and 25 V. EDW increased significantly the dry solid (DS) content, up to 43-45%, starting from 2 to 3% of raw sludge. The endogenous value of specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), monitored as indicator of biological stability, increased up to 56% and 39% after EDW tests for sludge from two WWTPs. On the other hand, the exogenous SOUR decreased, indicating a significant drop in the active bacterial population. Likewise, a 1-2 log unit reduction was observed for E. coli after EDW tests at 15 and 25 V. However, no remarkable removal of heavy metals, namely chromium, nickel, lead, copper and zinc, was achieved. Finally, the concentration of nutrients for soil, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, was not affected by the EDW process. In conclusion, EDW exerts considerable effects on the biological characteristics of sludge, which should be considered in a proper design of sludge management to ensure safe and sustainable resource recovery.

AB  - Important features of the Novorossiysk bora are being investigated using a nonlinear analytical stationary two-dimensional model. Vertical unboundedness of the atmosphere, characteristic features of the shape of the streamlined mountains, the effect of the upper layers on the disturbances in the troposphere are considered. For the first time disturbances are being studied in a wide range of changes in the features of an incident flow. It has been shown that disturbances quite often assume a rotor nature in the leeward zone behind the mountains, and the dependence of disturbances on the wave scale is decreasing only on average, and noticeable deviations from it are oscillatory in nature and depend on the level of reflection of wave energy from the upper layers. Jet stream velocity at the leeward slope estimates energetics of disturbances behind the mountains. It has been shown that its value lies in the range of 18-22 m/s under normal conditions. It has been testified that a sharp cooling in event of a bora is determined not by the process of flowing around the mountains, but by the arrival of a colder air mass. It has been concluded that an increase in speed indicator in the surface layer turbulent layer beyond the mountains is determined by the height and steepness of the leeward slope of the mountains, the effects of turbulence behind the mountains and is very sensitive to changes in the flow velocity at the leeward slope of the mountains.

AB  - A detailed analysis of the environmental geochemistry features of the sediments of two small lakes located in Petrozavodsk city was presented. Samples of lakes were collected in 2016 and 2018 using a peat drill for deep layers of sediments and a sampler Limnos for modern layers of deposits. In the laboratory, after the drying and abrasion of samples until the powder condition, sediments were measured by an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and mass-spectral method on a XSeries-2 ICP-MS instrument. To have an environmental interpretation of results the sum indicator of pollution and index of geoaccumulation were calculated for each waterbody. The results showed the lake sediments of Petrozavodsk have different geochemistry features and various levels of pollution of heavy metals. In comparison with the background, such metals as Pb, Sb, V, Cu, Zn, W, and Bi have the highest level of accumulation in Petrozavodsk's lakes. At the same time, the sediments of lake Chetyrekhverstnoye characterized by pollution from low to middle level and the sediments of lake Lamba have a pollution level from low to extremely high values. Almost all metals are predominantly in mineral phases, however, metals significantly have an association with organic matter and exchange fractions that present dangerously due to the migration of pollutants in systems "from sediments into the water" and "from sediments into biota".

AB  - Vulnerability to natural hazards not only depends on the magnitude of the hazards but also on the socioeconomic conditions of people. Considering vulnerability as a social construct, the social vulnerability index (SoVI) was introduced to measure the vulnerability of people across space. Very little is known about the social vulnerability of the coastal region of Bangladesh despite their high exposure to natural hazards like cyclones and coastal flooding. Applying modified SoVI, we investigated the social vulnerability of this region at the union level. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), twenty-seven variables are reduced to nine components, which explain 80.79% of the variance in the data. We mapped the composite SoVI score, which was calculated by adding the nine principal components. Results show that 24.26% of the areas of the region are high to very highly vulnerable and most of these areas are either situated near the Meghna estuarine or in the Cox's Bazar district. Results from Local and Global Moran's I show that there are significant clusters of composite scores of social vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of scalar changes (from the union to mouza) on the distribution of SoVI. Introducing a binary classification method to SoVI analysis, we found that scalar change reduces about 30% of the accuracy of vulnerability classification. The findings of this study will help policy-makers and disaster managers to formulate informed policy and disaster management plans.

AB  - Pseudo-hexagonal aragonite crystals occur profusely at various locations within the Upper Triassic sequences in Europe, America and Africa. In the Spanish Iberian Basin, they are associated with corrensite and gypsum, which characterize saline mudflat and salt-pond facies. Similarly, shaped crystals occur as dolomite, quartz, chalcedony or even copper pseudomorphs after aragonite in several parts of North and South America, and they are currently forming in association with hydrothermal spring deposits in Kenya. In Spain, this aragonite was first described at Molina de Aragon (Spain). Its origin has previously been explained as resulting from burial diagenetic processes, although petrographical, geochemical, stable isotope, and fluid inclusion evidence suggest a formation in other conditions. The aragonite crystals occur dominantly at locations near outcrops of pre-Hettangian alkaline magmatism, along Middle-to-Late Jurassic NW-SE faults. The formation of these aragonite crystals is interpreted as the result of upwards flow of hydrothermal fluids through the Middle-to-Late Jurassic synrift faults and the interaction with infiltrated shallow marine water. This hydrothermal circulation caused also the transformation of Mg-rich clay into corrensite. The pseudomorphs after aragonite found in other areas of the world appear related to sequences of similar depositional environments and interaction of magmatic intrusions within rifting settings. Such aragonite crystals may therefore help to unravel the geological and tectonic history in their area of occurrence.

AB  - Ascorbic acid (AA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) serve as an important coenzyme and enzyme in multiple biological metabolism reactions, respectively, and abnormal levels of these substrates have been associated with several diseases. Herein, a new and simple fluorescence strategy has been developed for AA and ALP sensing by exploiting CdTe quantum dots (QDs) as an effective signal indicator. This method is mainly based on the selective fluorescence-quenching reaction between Ag+ and CdTe QDs, as opposed to silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs); Ag+ can be reduced to Ag NPs by AA. Furthermore, by taking advantage of AA as a mediator, this strategy is further exploited for ALP assay given that ALP can cause the hydrolysis of l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AAP), which yields AA. Under optimal conditions, controlled generation of Ag NPs and the selective recognition-based sensing system exhibit high sensitivity toward AA and ALP with limits of detection (LODs) of 3 M and 0.25 U L-1 and linear ranges of detection from 0 to 800 M and 1 to 1000 U L-1, respectively. Moreover, the sensor was successfully used for assaying AA in fruit juice and ALP in human serum. The results demonstrate that the proposed fluorescence strategy has significant advantages, such as its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and rapid runtime, and the operational convenience of this label-free method further demonstrates its potential for constructing effective sensors with biochemical and clinical applications.

AB  - Skin, being one of the vital organs and a protective barrier needs to be pampered and taken care of from early childhood. It is the most visible and the widest exposed organ and by far reflects the general health condition and the aging process in humans. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to this complex biological process of skin aging. In recent times, skin health and its beauty is perceived as an indicator of one's health which has resulted in an increasing demand for anti-aging products. Exposure to UV radiation is considered to be one of the factors responsible for aging termed as photoaging. In this review, we have discussed the various factors which may accelerate the process of skin aging. Various approaches and strategies to delay the process of skin aging have been emphasized upon. The patents filed in the area of anti-aging and sunscreen products have also been reviewed to gain an insight into the new formulations which have been developed as an anti-aging product. There has been a tremendous rise in the cosmetic and cosmeceuticals market with products having a dual activity of anti-aging and sun protection. Research is constantly on the rise to ensure the safety of these products. Alternatives to the current topical application of sunscreen are being considered to overcome the drawback of reapplication of the sunscreen often which can be a boon to the cosmeceutical market.

AB  - In Africa, the early Holocene was characterized by wetter, warmer conditions than today, followed by rapid aridification at similar to 5.2 ka. However, a lack of lowland vegetation records has prevented a detailed evaluation of forest response to Holocene climate change. Additionally, although modern vegetation communities are linked to human disturbance, few studies have addressed how prehistoric human activities helped engineer the character of modern African ecosystems. Understanding the architecture of lowland and highland forests is important to prevent further degradation from climate/land-use change. We present an 11,000 yr fossil pollen record from Lake Edward, Uganda. We show that Guineo-Congolian forests dominated the highlands and lowlands in equatorial East Africa in the early Holocene, highlighting the importance of rainfall and temperature in controlling forest communities. These forests remained until similar to 5.2 ka, when the climate became drier. The lacustrine ecosystem response to aridification was abrupt; however, forest decreased gradually, replaced by deciduous woodlands. Woodlands dominated until after an arid period at 2 ka; however, forest did not recover. Increased disturbance indicators and grasses suggest that the arrival of Iron Age people resulted in the modern fire-tolerant vegetation. Although late Holocene climate played a role in vegetation opening, the modern ecosystem architecture in East Africa is linked to early human activities.

AB  - Five treatments (short-neck clam Ruditapes philippinarum and four formulated diets with the green microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta or the golden-brown microalgae Isochrysis galbana in the ratio (dw/dw) of 5% or 10% to that of clam meat) were used to investigate the growth performance and haemolymph quality of juvenile Chinese horseshoe crabs Tachypleus tridentatus under laboratory culture. At the end of the 12-week study, various growth and moulting indicators as well as haemolymph biochemical parameters did not show any significant differences among the treatments. Significantly higher percentages of haemolymph amoebocyte viability and granular-spherical amoebocyte state were noted in both 5% and 10% I.galbana-supplemented diets compared to that of clam meat. However, the percentages of these two haemolymph parameters in juveniles fed with D.tertiolecta decreased significantly at the end of the experiment. Such differences were attributed to the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), notably eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in I.galbana that was absent in D.tertiolecta and clam meat. Like many marine invertebrates, juvenile horseshoe crabs do not naturally obtain sufficient PUFAs from their diets to meet developmental and physiological needs; hence, supplementing microalgae with high levels of EPA in a protein-rich diet boosts immune competence and the health status of juvenile horseshoe crabs while under culture.

AB  - Impact assessment of sluice regulation on water quality is one of the crucial tasks in the present river management. However, research difficulties remain because of insufficient in situ data and numerous influencing factors in aquatic environments. The Huaidian Sluice, the main control sluice of the Shaying River, China, was selected for this study. Three field experimental programs were designed and carried out to analyze spatial and temporal variations in water quality parameters under various sluice regulation conditions and to explore the impacts of regulation mechanisms on water quality. Monitoring data were used to simulate water quality under different scenarios by the water quality analysis simulation program (WASP). Results demonstrate that the influences of sluice regulation on permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) concentrations (indicators of water quality) were complex and nonlinear and presented different trends of increase or decrease from different regulation modes. Gate openings of different widths and different flow rates affected CODMn and NH4-N concentrations differently. Monitoring results and numerical simulation results indicate that the sluice opening should be small. Flow discharge through the sluice should be greater than 10 m(3) s and less than 60 m(3) s to maintain low CODMn concentrations, and discharge should be low (e. g., 14 m(3) s) to maintain low NH4-N concentrations. This research provides an experimental basis for further research on the construction of water quality models and for the development of reasonable regulations on water quality and quantity.

AB  - Seabirds are considered reliable indicators of the marine environment due to their reliance on ocean-based resources and position at the top of the marine foodweb. The status of the world's bird populations have deteriorated over the past 20 years with seabirds declining faster than any other bird group. For some seabird species, a lack of data or synthesis of available data limits our ability to detect changes in population trends and gain insight into the condition of the surrounding marine environment. The Flesh-footed Shearwater (FFSH; Puffinus carneipes) exemplifies this with demographic and count data either absent or outdated for most breeding islands. Results of a survey of 20 FFSH breeding islands in South and Western Australia during 2011-2014, and a synthesis of all available data indicate the current global population is substantially smaller than previously thought, comprising no more than 74 000 breeding pairs. While much of the reduction in numbers is due to outdated burrow counts which are shown to be a poor measure of population size in this species, there is evidence of a decline in numbers on at least six islands that account for similar to 40% of the world's population. A review of novel and existing data on FFSH breeding habits (burrow occupancy and density), concurrent threats, and population size in South and Western Australia are presented here along with priorities for management of this declining marine predator.

AB  - In the eastern United States, there is interest among forest landowners in American ginseng husbandry, and particularly in cultivating this plant on forestlands using a wild-simulated forest farming approach. This study documented the flora and soil conditions associated with wild and wild-simulated ginseng populations throughout Pennsylvania (PA) to develop floristic "indicators" that can be used to identify supportive growing sites on forestlands. A total of 243 plant species were documented associates of ginseng across PA: 32 over-story trees, 37 shrubs and understory trees, 15 vines, 143 herbs, and 16 ferns. Statistical analysis revealed a largely shared floristic assemblage throughout the state although some associates did differ according to region and physiographic province. Previous studies have suggested that a soil calcium content, especially soils having at least 3,360 kg ha(-1) (3,000 lbs ac), appear to be particularly conducive to wild and wild-simulated ginseng occurrence and/or vigor, and indicator species analysis in this study revealed that three of the top plant associates that can be used for determining sites that meet this calcium threshold in PA are white ash, Jack-in-the-pulpit, and rattlesnake fern. These results suggest that successful adoption of wild-simulated ginseng forest farming is likely to be improved in forested areas where these species are found collectively as a dominant component of local plant assemblages.

AB  - Premise of the study: Reconstruction of floristic patterns during the early diversification of angiosperms is impeded by the scarce fossil record, especially in tropical latitudes. Here we collected quantitative palynological data from a stratigraphic sequence in tropical South America to provide floristic and climatic insights into such tropical environments during the Early Cretaceous.
   Methods: We reconstructed the floristic composition of an Aptian-Albian tropical sequence from central Colombia using quantitative palynology (rarefied species richness and abundance) and used it to infer its predominant climatic conditions. Additionally, we compared our results with available quantitative data from three other sequences encompassing 70 floristic assemblages to determine latitudinal diversity patterns.
   Key results: Abundance of humidity indicators was higher than that of aridity indicators (61% vs. 10%). Additionally, we found an angiosperm latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) for the Aptian, but not for the Albian, and an inverted LDG of the overall diversity for the Albian. Angiosperm species turnover during the Albian, however, was higher in humid tropics.
   Conclusions: There were humid climates in northwestern South America during the Aptian-Albian interval contrary to the widespread aridity expected for the tropical belt. The Albian inverted overall LDG is produced by a faster increase in per-sample angiosperm and pteridophyte diversity in temperate latitudes. However, humid tropical sequences had higher rates of floristic turnover suggesting a higher degree of morphological variation than in temperate regions.

AB  - 1. Many recent studies have quantified the relative importance of environmental variables and dispersal limitations in shaping the structure of stream communities. However, the relative importance of these factors at different spatial extents has been seldom evaluated. 2. We analysed the distribution of caddisfly species in 89 Amazonian streams in relation to stream characteristics and spatial variables representing overland dispersal routes. The streams occur in three regions that differ in spatial extent and environmental characteristics. We analysed the data using partial redundancy analysis with two predictor data sets, one environmental and one spatial, to evaluate the variation in assemblage composition. We also separated caddisflies into good and poor dispersers to evaluate possible differences in the responses of these two groups. 3. The environmental component explained a higher proportion of variance in assemblage composition than did the spatial component. Spatial effects were evident only when data from all three regions were analysed together, although the exclusive spatial fraction was quite low. Good dispersers responded similarly to the community as a whole, while poor dispersers were related to environmental variables only in one region and also were not related to spatial variables. 4. Caddisflies were most affected by environmental factors. The large environmental effect and small spatial effect are in accord with the use of these stream insects as good indicators of site properties and disturbances in monitoring programmes.

AB  - Snow cover and glaciers are sensitive indicators of the environment. The vast spatial coverage of remote sensing data, coupled with the tough conditions in areas of interest has made remote sensing a particularly useful tool in the field of glaciology. Compared to optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are hardly influenced by clouds. This is important because glacial areas are usually under cloud cover. The Dongkemadi glacier in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau was selected as the study area for this paper. We use polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image for classification on and around the glacier. The contrast between ice and wet snow is remarkable, but it is difficult to distinguish the ice from the ground on SAR images due to similar backscatter characteristics in former research. In our study, we found that this distinction can be achieved by target decomposition. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are performed to classify the glacier areas using the selected features. The glacial areas are classified into six parts: wet snow, ice, river outwash, soil land, rocky land and others. The PolSAR-Target decomposition-SVMs (PTS) method is proven to be efficient, with an overall classification accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.875. Moreover, 86.63% of the bare ice and 96.76% of the wet snow are correctly classified. The classification map acquired using the PTS method also helps to determine the snow line, which is an important concept in glaciology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The aim of the present study is to propose a nonlinear model which provides an indicator for the maximum phytoextraction of metals to help in the decision-making process. Research into different species and strategies plays an important role in the application of phytoextraction techniques to the remediation of contaminated soil. Also, the convenience of species according to their biomass and pollutant accumulation capacities has gained important space in discussions regarding remediation strategies, whether to choose species with low accumulation capacities and high biomass or high accumulation capacities with low biomass.
   Methods The effects of heavy metals in soil on plant growth are studied by means of a nonlinear interaction model which relates the dynamics of the uptake of heavy metals by plants to heavy metal deposed in soil.
   Results The model, presented theoretically, provides an indicator for the maximum phytoextraction of metals which depends on adjustable parameters of both the plant and the environmental conditions. Finally, in order to clarify its applicability, a series of experimental results found in the literature are presented to show how the model performs consistently with real data.
   Conclusions The inhibition of plant growth due to heavy metal concentration can be predicted by a simple kinetic model. The model proposed in this study makes it possible to characterize the nonlinear behaviour of the soil-plant interaction with heavy metal pollution in order to establish maximum uptake values for heavy metals in the harvestable part of plants.

AB  - A model study was conducted to understand the influence of non-point sources including bather shedding, animal fecal sources, and near shore sand, as well as the impact of the environmental conditions, on the fate and transport of the indicator microbe, enterococci, at a subtropical recreational marine beach in South Florida. The model was based on an existing finite element hydrodynamic and transport model, with the addition of a first order microbe deactivation function due to solar radiation. Results showed that dog fecal events had a major transient impact (hundreds of Colony Forming Units/100 ml [CFU/100 ml]) on the enterococci concentration in a limited area within several hours, and could partially explain the high concentrations observed at the study beach. Enterococci released from beach sand during high tide caused mildly elevated concentration for a short period of time (ten to twenty of CFU/100 ml initially, reduced to 2 CFU/100 ml within 4 h during sunny weather) similar to the average baseline numbers observed at the beach. Bather shedding resulted in minimal impacts (less than 1 CFU/100 ml), even during crowded holiday weekends. In addition, weak current velocity near the beach shoreline was found to cause longer dwelling times for the elevated concentrations of enterococci, while solar deactivation was found to be a strong factor in reducing these microbial concentrations.

TI  - CARBON STORAGE IN THE ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS AS INDICATOR OF LOGGING IMPACT IN THE IMATACA FOREST RESERVE, VENEZUELA
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
LA  - Spanish
KW  - GROWTH
KW  - TREES
AB  - Tropical forests are threatened by several and diverse forms of human activity that can severely compromise their long term stability Land use changes, unsustainable logging and global change are probably the most relevant. Using information from permanent plots periodically monitored in logged and unlogged areas in the Imataca Forest Reserve, Southeastern Venezuela, aboveground carbon storage for both forest conditions was estimated for an eight year period. Although selective logging only concentrates on similar to 10% of total aboveground biomass (5.93.m(3).ha(-1)), one year after logging operations the exploited forests had similar to 50% less carbon than unlogged areas, which is expressed in a net difference of 81.43MgC.ha(-1) between both areas, suggesting a considerable impact on the remnant forest. Additionally, with an annual rate of 0.55 +/- 0.61MgC.ha(-1).year(-1) in logged areas, a total recovery of original carbon stocks is expected after similar to 150 years. Results also indicate that in terms of impact, carbon stocks after logging are under a medium change threshold (MCT), indicating a negative effect. Through the improvement of forest operations, in particular the adoption of reduced impact logging (RIL) techniques and an adequate carbon monitoring program, among others, carbon loss due to logging could be considerably reduced and a faster ecosystem recovery and CO2 absorption allowed. The results obtained may serve as a basis for a new strategy that can contribute to promote a sustainable forest management in Venezuelan tropical forests in the context of global change.

AB  - A 200 m(2) pilot-scale field test successfully demonstrated the use of nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) for effective remediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds in Taiwan within six months. Both commercially available and on-site synthesized NZVI were used. A well-defined monitoring program allowing to collect three-dimensional spatial data from 13 nested multi-level monitoring wells was conducted to monitor geochemical parameters in groundwater. The degradation efficiency of vinyl chloride (VC) determined at most of monitoring wells was 50-99%. It was found that the injection of NZVI caused a significant change in total iron, total solid (TS) and suspended solid (SS) concentrations in groundwater. Total iron concentration showed a moderate and weak correlation with SS and TS, respectively, suggesting that SS maybe used to indicate the NZVI distribution in groundwater. A decrease in oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) values from about -100 to -400 mV after NZVI injection was observed. This revealed that NZVI is an effective means of achieving highly reducing conditions in the subsurface environment. Both VC degradation efficiency and ORP showed a correlative tendency as an increase in VC degradation efficiency corresponded to a decrease of ORP. This is in agreement with the previous studies suggesting that ORP can serve as an indicator for the NZVI reactivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial distribution of breeding resources can have pronounced demographic and evolutionary consequences. We used 20 experimental groups of the bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), an annual fish with a promiscuous, resource-based mating system, and extended breeding season to investigate how the spatial distribution (clumped or regular) of bitterling oviposition sites (live freshwater mussels) affected offspring production, variation in reproductive success, and directional selection on phenotypic traits over their entire reproductive lifetime. We did not detect any effect of resource distribution on offspring production or variation in reproductive success among individual fish, although variation between replicates was higher with a clumped distribution. This finding is discussed with regard to the incidence of alternative mating behaviors (sneaking) within the limitations imposed by our experimental design. Breeding resource distribution had a significant effect on selection on male phenotypic traits. Stronger directional selection on traits associated with intrasexual competition for fertilizations, gonad mass (an indicator of sperm competition), and the extent of red, carotenoid-based pigment in the iris (an index of dominance status), was detected with a clumped resource distribution. With a regular resource distribution, a stronger positive selection on male body size was detected. We discuss the implications of our results for natural populations.

AB  - We have estimated the pK(a), values of different series of imidazol-1-ylalcanoic acid derivatives using combinations of semiempirical or ab initio methods and two semiempirical solvation models SM2 and SM5.4. None of these procedures was able to describe the zwitterionic structure of the carboxylic monoacids series as their most stable form determined experimentally in solution. Under these conditions, a comparison of the theoretical and experimental pK(a), values showed RMS differences ranging from 1.43 to 3.04 pK(a) units. As an alternative strategy we describe here a mathematical model for pKa determination based on quantitative structure-property relationships. The model uses two quantum chemical descriptors, the natural atomic charge on the N3 proton (q(H)(+)) and the frontier orbital energy (epsilon(L)), allowing the determination of pK(a), values for every compound of a given series with a reasonable computational effort. A linear relationship is described among pKa, qH+, I-L and the number of ester groups in the molecule n. Multiple linear regression analysis of the available series of imidazol-1-ylalcanoic compounds allowed to obtain the expression pKa 119.435 X q(H)(+) + 0.612 X epsilon(L) - 1.043 X n + 65.204 which reproduced the experimental values within 0.1 pK(a) units.

AB  - Being suspected to have carcinogenic and estrogenic properties, the determination of phthalate esters in various environmental samples is very important for environmental risk assessment. In the present paper, a new solid-phase extraction system for HPLC determination of di-ethyl-phthalate, di-n-propyl-phthalate, di-iso-butyl-phthalate, and di-cyclohexyl-phthalate was developed. The four analytes were quantitatively adsorbed on multi-walled carbon nanotubes packed cartridge, then the analytes were quantitatively desorbed with acetonitrile, finally the analytes in acetonitrile eluate were determined by HPLC. Parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as volume of sample solutions and eluent volume, were examined. Under the optimized conditions, detection limits of 0.18-0.86 ng ml(-1) were achieved for four phthalate esters. The proposed method had been used to determine the four phthalate esters in tap water, river water, and sea water samples. No phthalate esters were found in the river water and sea water samples. For the case of tap water sample, di-ethyl-phthalate, di-n-propyl-phthalate, and di-cyclohexyl-phthalate were not found, only 2.0 ng ml(-1) of di-iso-butyl-phthalate was found. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested by recovery measurements on spiked samples, the recoveries of 80.3-104.5% were obtained in most cases. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) flux density at the earth's surface depends on the incoming solar energy and the transmission properties of the atmosphere. UV radiation is strongly absorbed by ozone in the spectral range 200-310 nm, while the attenuation is increasingly weaker at longer wavelengths. Following the discovery of the Antarctic ozone bole in 1985, the risk of a possible UV increase at ground level, due to the observed stratospheric ozone depletion, has heightened the interest within the scientific community given the potentially harmful effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Spectroradiometers, broad-band meters and dosimeters may be used for measurements of solar UV. In addition, radiation transfer models can be used to quantify UV irradiances at various times and locations, provided that the extraterrestrial solar radiation and the state of the atmosphere are known. Information about UV radiation at the earth's surface is given by the ultraviolet index UVI', which is defined as the effective integrated irradiance (280-400 nm) weighted by the erythemal action spectrum. The UV Index is widely used by many international weather services as an indicator of UV levels at the earth's surface providing public awareness of the effects of prolonged exposure to the sun's rays.
   The aim of this paper is to present a device capable of estimating the UV Index. This device is a compact disc, used as a sundial, and is based on modelled UV irradiances derived from the STAR radiative transfer model (System for Transfer of Atmospheric Radiation). The device was tested in an urban setting under clear sky conditions.

AB  - Conservation of rare plant species often involves small, local populations dispersed within apparently suitable habitat. We used enzyme electrophoresis to study genotypic diversity in 32 populations of Calystegia collina, a self-incompatible clonal plant endemic to serpentine substrate in northern California's Coast Range. Genotypic diversity within a population was a good predictor of seed set by randomly marked flowers. Ramets from the most abundant genotypes in a population were most likely to produce flowers, but flowers from abundant genotypes were less likely to produce seed capsules than were flowers from rarer genotypes. These results are consistent with previous findings that reproductive success in C. collina is limited by the availability of compatible pollen. On small serpentine outcrops supporting only one or two populations, C. collina did not show reduced genotypic diversity or heterozygosity compared with populations on large outcrops supporting many populations. Instead, genotypic diversity and outcrop size had strong but independent influences on reproductive success. Although large serpentine outcrops contain more populations and provide better conditions for flower and seed production, significant diversity of unique genotypes clearly exists in isolated serpentine outcrops. Our findings suggest that plant conservation strategies must take into account the natural distribution of populations. The effects of habitat fragmentation on C. collina and other plant species that occur naturally in small, discrete patches may be unlike those that have been documented in more recently fragmented species.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are one of the most widely and abundantly distributed organisms in the fjords of Svalbard and Norway. Due to their short life span and quick reactivity to environmental changes they can be used as indicators of the "atlantification" process. Here, we compare the benthic foraminifera assemblages along the latitudinal gradient, from the fjords of northern Svalbard to southern Norway to assess whether the "atlantification" process may homogenise the foraminiferal assemblages in terms of their abundance and species composition. Furthermore, the previously published data on benthic foraminiferal faunas was updated to identify changes in distribution that have occurred over the last few decades. For this purpose, fjord mouths in western and northern Svalbard (Isfjorden, Wijdefjorden and Rijpfjorden) and northern and southern Norway (Balsfjorden, Raunefjorden and Hjeltefjorden) were resampled. The analysis revealed similarities between the Svalbard and Norwegian foraminiferal assemblages of up to 30%; however, there were essential differences in terms of abundance and biodiversity. These results suggest that Svalbard fjords will remain distinct in the future, even under conditions of further warming or "atlantification". Svalbard fjords may be dominated by Atlantic Water- preferring species, whereas, in Norwegian fjords, pressure from human activity will probably be the main driver of environmental changes, leading to changes in the foraminiferal assemblages with the increasing dominance of opportunistic, hypoxia-tolerant species.

AB  - The timing of lake ice breakup and freezeup are important indicators of climate change in Arctic and boreal regions because they respond rapidly and directly to variations in climate conditions. Despite its importance, lake ice phenology remains poorly documented in most lakes of Alaska. To fill this data gap, we constructed a remote sensing-derived lake ice phenology database covering all lakes in Alaska larger than 1 km(2) (n = 4241) over the period 2000-2019. This dataset, which includes lake ice on/off dates and lake ice duration, was based on an automatic method using daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiomenter (MODIS) imagery to measure lake ice fraction. This method extracts lake ice pixels from MODIS images using a dynamic threshold that was calibrated against Landsat Fmask. Different filters that account for clouds, polar night, and other sources of error were applied to increase the accuracy of lake ice phenology estimation. Trend analysis shows earlier breakup (-5.5 d decade(-1)) for 440 lakes and later breakup (7.5 d decade(-1)) for four lakes (p < 0.05). A total of 289 lakes had significant trends toward later freezeup (2.9 d decade(-1)) and 11 lakes towards earlier freezeup (-3.3 d decade(-1)). Most lakes with significant trends are north of the Brooks Range. This dataset can contribute to increased understanding of interactions between lake processes and climate change, and it supports the study of biogeochemical, limnological and ecological regimes in Alaska and pan-Arctic regions.

AB  - Dispersion modelling is an effective tool to estimate traffic-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in near-road environments. However, many sources of uncertainty and variability are associated with the process of near-road dispersion modelling, which renders a single-number estimate of concentration a poor indicator of near-road air quality. In this study, we propose an integrated trafficemission-dispersion modelling chain that incorporates several major sources of uncertainty. Our approach generates PM2.5 probability distributions capturing the uncertainty in emissions and meteorological conditions. Traffic PM2.5 emissions from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. were estimated at 3400 +/- 117 g. Modelled PM2.5 levels were validated against measurements along a major arterial road in Toronto, Canada. We observe large overlapping areas between modelled and measured PM2.5 distributions at all locations along the road, indicating a high likelihood that the model can reproduce measured concentrations. A policy scenario expressing the impact of reductions in truck emissions revealed that a 30% reduction in near-road PM2.5 concentrations can be achieved by upgrading close to 55% of the current trucks circulating along the corridor. A speed limit reduction of 10 km/h could lead to statistically significant increases in PM2.5 concentrations at twelve out of the eighteen locations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In modern conditions, investment activity is a non-alternative option for increasing the competitiveness of agricultural production and a driver for increasing the country's export potential. The aim of the work is the development of methodological approaches to assessing the investment attractiveness of agriculture and the study of factors influencing it, as well as the rationale for practical recommendations to increase it. An author's methodological approach to assessing the investment attractiveness of agriculture has been developed, the essence of which is to build an integrated indicator based on the synergy of assessment indicators of innovative, scientific, intellectual, production and technological potential, natural resources, as well as taking into account the risks of financial and economic activity. The study identified constraining and accelerating factors of investment attractiveness of agriculture at the macro, meso and micro levels. Based on the correlation and regression analysis, a model of the dynamics of innovative development in accordance with investment investments is built. The empirical analysis revealed significant imbalances in the investment policy of agriculture. To eliminate them, innovative sources of financing investment in agriculture are proposed. The study developed a mechanism for managing investment attractiveness in agriculture, a feature of which is the stimulation of innovative susceptibility to the introduction of innovations at all stages of the innovation process. The practical significance of the results of the study is to increase the efficiency of agricultural production by improving the forms and mechanisms of attracting investment resources to the innovative development of the industry.

AB  - In the field of construction industry, the research work has widely focused on identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and critical success factors (CSFs) without assessing the impact of conflict environment factors. There is a lack of research on the organization performance in the post-conflict environment. This study focuses on the effects of post-conflict environment factors on construction organization performance. This article explores the relationship of post-conflict environment and organization performance to formulate success strategy in a post-conflict condition. This article presents a performance predicting model comprising the impact of post-conflict environment factors on construction organization. The proposed framework of this research consists of four stages: identify post-conflict environment impacting factors, determine KPIs, assess CSFs and adopt the best strategy to improve performance. Analytical hierarchy process and multiple linear regression modeling technique have been used to analyze quantitative and qualitative variables obtained from the literature and expert opinion through a comprehensive literature search and survey questionnaire. The study finding suggests that top twenty factors from the survey have a critical impact on the identified five performance measures. This study examined 51 local construction organizations performance initiated between 2001 and August 2016 in Afghanistan. This research contributes to cover the lack of research on the organization performance in the post-conflict environment. The developed models will benefit organizations in assessing their performance in post conflict situations.

AB  - Wildfires are a driving factor of forest soils and their biota, especially in fire-prone ecosystems. Fire effects on soil microbial community are complex and still largely unknown. Greater knowledge is needed as fire frequency is expected to increase with human-induced climate change. This study aims at assessing the effects of a single moderately severe wildfire on microbial community diversity and activity in a Mediterranean forest soil by DNA molecular screening (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). For this purpose, the soil of a burned area was sampled 3 days and 10 months after the fire and compared with the soil of an unburned contiguous area. For the DNA fingerprinting, we analyzed both extracellular and intracellular DNA fractions of the soil metagenome. The fire impact on soil was also rated in terms of selected enzyme activities, as reliable bioindicators of biogeochemical cycles. An immediate fire-induced general decrease in enzyme activities and more durable changes in the bacterial and fungal communities structure were found, although microbial biomass was not significantly affected. Litter layer was completely turned to char and ash by the fire, but after 10 months, it showed a fair amount of DNA, a structured microbial community, and a good enzymatic activity. Overall, such relatively fast recovery was likely caused by the microbial biomass that survived the fire, which evidently adapted to the new soil conditions.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment (ERA) methodologies for consumer product chemicals are well established in most developed regions including the United States, Canada, and the European Union. However, such methodologies are not yet fully developed for emerging economies, such as China. The objective of the present study was to develop an ERA framework involving an exposure methodology using conditions specific to China (i.e., physical setting, infrastructure, and consumers' habits and practice). Incorporated in this newly developed ERA framework for assessing consumer product chemicals were China's current regulatory screening and prioritization schemes as part of a tiered risk assessment approach. The framework started with tier 0, which utilized the existing Chinese regulatory qualitative method; tiers 1 and 2 were quantitative, and used deterministic and probabilistic methods that accounted for per capita residential water usage, wastewater treatment capability, and wastewater/in-stream dilution factors. Due to major differences in wastewater treatment infrastructure and water usage between urban versus rural regions in China, 2 scenarios were identified for quantitatively assessing environmental exposure: 1) urban with wastewater treatment, and 2) rural without wastewater treatment (i.e., direct discharge of wastewater). Our study presents the methodology of the framework with its technical rationale and the companion model Chera, and also provides an overview of the current status of ERA research in China.

AB  - We study propagation of uncertainty related to bioreactive parameters through the biodegradation reaction network of atrazine (ATZ) and its metabolites in soils. The work is motivated by the recognition that detailed analyses of these aspects in models of complex biogeochemical systems is especially critical when the feedback amongst hydraulic, chemical and microbial processes is strong. With an emphasis on microbial processes, the ATZ reaction network is exemplary because it includes 19 biological reactions mediated by 3 microbial functional groups that compete in 6 metabolic and co-metabolic degradation pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Propagation of model parametric uncertainty yields the probability distributions of ATZ, its metabolites, and the microbial biomass. It also enables us to identify key parameters that drive the long-term system dynamics. We base our analyses on an initial screening of model parameters and a subsequent moment-based global sensitivity analysis, and we show that the probability density of target outputs are multimodal as a result of nonlinearities in the degradation rate formulations. The employed global sensitivity metrics reveal that joint effects of the uncertainty of multiple kinetic parameters significantly contribute to output uncertainties, thus suggesting the presence of a high level of coupling between processes included in the network. Specific biomass affinity to a given substrate is found to be a lumped indicator that can facilitate the analysis of microbial growth when multiple and competing microbial functional groups coexist.

AB  - Resilience is a broad concept that encompasses different kinds of phenomena, such as effective functioning under severe conditions, adaptation to stress and attaining normal functioning after exposure to potentially traumatic experiences. The study of resilient behavior of individuals, communities and societies provide researchers and practitioners with better knowledge and understanding of human coping and adaptation. Reports about unfortunate and stressful events in social media news sites trigger various appraisals among social media users. Some of these appraisals are translated into user generated symbolic, textual and visual content - and offer a unique opportunity to observe how the public "digests" and copes with the changing reality. With the rise of social media, the abundance of user-generated content, public application programming interfaces for social media services and the availability of efficient data extraction and analytical tools - researchers and practitioners can explore in detail citizen' attitudes towards various issues in their external environment, including in-depth understanding of their coping modes and resiliency. The objective of this review is to describe how existing and recently developed tools in the field of social computing can be utilized to assess different aspects of resilience, through mining of the social media. We propose several indicators for resilience factors, and present methods and techniques to search, processes and analyze textual and visual content, commonly published on social media. It is proposed that automatic and immediate detection of resilience factors in users' discourse, will significantly improve the ability of decision makers generate public situational awareness based on social media data.

AB  - The stray flux that is present in the vicinity of an induction motor is a very interesting information source to detect several types of failures in these machines. The analysis of this quantity can be employed, in some cases, as a supportive tool to complement the diagnosis provided by other quantities. In other cases, when no other motor quantities are available, stray flux analysis can become one of the few alternatives to evaluate the motor condition. Its noninvasive nature, low cost, and easy implementation makes it a very interesting option that requires further investigation. The aim of this work is to evaluate the suitability of the stray flux analysis under the starting transient as a way to detect certain faults in induction motors (broken rotor bars and misalignments), even when these types of faults coexist in the motor. To this end, advanced signal processing tools will be applied. Several positions of the flux sensors are considered in this study. Also, for the first time, a fault indicator based on the stray flux analysis under the starting is introduced and its sensitivity is compared versus other indicators relying on other quantities. It must be emphasized that, since the capture of the transient and steady-state flux signals can be carried out in the same measurement, the application of the approach presented in this work is straightforward and its derived information may become crucial for the diagnosis of some faults.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in 16 sites in three industrial regions in Poland was analysed to delineate dendroclimatologically uniform areas. A dendrochronological and mass spectrometric analysis revealed the following: a dry and sunny previous September, low winter temperature, and moisture supply in July limit the radial growth of the pines in all the regions. The weather conditions of the current growing season have been the most strongly reflected in the isotopic ratio. Positive relationships were noted between delta C-13 and temperature and delta C-13 and sunshine. A negative relationship was observed between delta C-13 and precipitation and delta C-13 and humidity. At the same time, a positive relationship was noted between delta O-18 and sunshine and delta O-18 and temperature, but negative between delta O-18 and humidity. The climate signal recorded in the stable isotope composition was temporally unstable and only for a few of the climatic parameters did we find temporally stable climate signals. However, variability in the strength and direction of the relationships between variables has been observed. In general, the weather in July and August is important for determining the delta C-13 and delta O-18 signals. Instability can reflect the physiological adaptation of the plants to changes in the ecosystem.

AB  - Global warming during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) approximate to 55.5 million years ago (Ma) was associated with a massive release of carbon to the ocean-atmosphere system, as evidenced by a prominent negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) and widespread dissolution of marine carbonates. The paleohydrologic response to the PETM warming has been studied worldwide; however, relevant records of environmental perturbation in Asia are lacking so far. Here we extend the record of this event in central China, a subtropical paleosetting, through geochemical and mineralogical analyses of lacustrine sediments. Geochemical indicators of authigenic carbonatesincluding molar Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratiossuggest an overall increased precipitation across the PETM, compatible with the disappearance of authigenic dolomite and the appearance of kaolinite in the strata. The relatively humid conditions persisted long after the carbon-cycle perturbation had stopped, implying that the transient hyper-greenhouse warming might have forced the regional climate system into a new climate state that was not easily reversed. Additionally, a gradual increase in chemical index of alteration (CIA) and the appearance of kaolinite are associated with the PETM, indicating an intensified silicate weathering and pedogenesis in the watershed in response to warmer and more humid climate. Our results corroborate the theory that an accelerated continental chemical weathering served as a negative feedback to sequester carbon and lower the atmospheric greenhouse-gas levels during the PETM.

AB  - The sulfate mineral jarosite is considered a key indicator of hydrous, acidic, and oxidizing conditions on the surface of early Mars. Here we report an analog terrestrial locality hosting jarosite from Matanumadh, Kachchh, western India, using detailed spectroscopic studies on weathered basalts of the Deccan Volcanic Province and overlying tuffaceous shales and sandstones of the Matanumadh Formation. Hyperspectral data in the visible/near-infrared (350-2500nm) to midinfrared (4000-400cm(-1)) region of the electromagnetic spectrum and X-ray diffraction patterns have been acquired on samples collected from the field to detect and characterize the hydrous sulfate and phyllosilicate phases present at the studied site. Hydrous sulfates occur in association with Al-rich phyllosilicates (kaolinite) that overlie a zone of Fe/Mg smectites in altered basalts. Jarosite is found within both saprolitic clay horizons altered from the basalt and within variegated sandstone and shale/clay units overlying the saprolite; it mostly occurs as secondary veins with or without gypsum. Jarosite is also seen as coatings on kaolinite clasts of varying shapes and sizes within the tuffaceous variegated sandstone unit. We argue that the overall geological setting of the Matanumadh area, with this unusual mineral assemblage developing within altered basalts and in the overlying sedimentary sequence, mimics the geological environment of many of the identified jarosite localities on Mars and can be considered as a Martian analog from this perspective.
