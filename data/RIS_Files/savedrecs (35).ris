AB  - To investigate the effects of extreme rainfall events (EREs) on lake water quality, we analyzed the lake monthly monitoring data at the stations close to inflow rivers. We tested the hypothesis that the effects depend on rainfall magnitude, season, distance from the rivers, etc. The highest correlations with many water-quality indicators were obtained for the rainfall amount for the preceding 10 days before the water sampling days; i.e., negatively with Na+, Cl-, chlorophyll a (Chla), and COD, and positively with ortho-phosphate. We used the threshold of rainfall amount >= 140 mm to choose EREs and evaluate the water quality on such occasions because quite low values of Na+, Cl-, and Chla thresholds (<= 25th percentile) were observed in some of the EREs. The event samples (group 1; G1) meeting the above thresholds probably represented the inflow waters during EREs (generally occurred in Oct-May), and the others (group 2; G2) indicated significant changes in the lakes (Jun to Sep), probably depending on the lake's state of primary production. In the events of lower rainfall events (50 mm to 140 mm for 10 days), fast recoveries of algal production usually occurred even in Oct to May. The values of COD, total phosphorus, and ortho-phosphate in G1 were higher than the values of river water quality in the baseflow conditions, whereas both the G1 and baseflow values of nitrogen were nearly the same. The effects of ERFs on lake water quality from the viewpoints of tempo-longitudinal distributions, future monitoring, and climate change were discussed.

AB  - Underwater noise has been identified as a relevant pollution affecting marine ecosystems in different ways. Despite the numerous studies performed over the last few decades regarding the adverse effect of underwater noise on marine life, a lack of knowledge and methodological procedures still exists, and results are often tentative or qualitative. A monitoring methodology for the behavioral response of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) when exposed to ship and wind turbine operational noises was implemented and tested in a fixed commercial tuna feeding cage in the Mediterranean sea. Fish behavior was continuously monitored, combining synchronized echosounder and video recording systems. Automatic information extracted from acoustical echograms was used to describe tuna reaction to noise in terms of average depth and vertical dimensions of the school and the indicators of swimming speed and tilt direction. Video recordings allowed us to detect changes in swimming patterns. Different kinds of stimuli were considered during bluefin tuna cage monitoring, such as noise generated by feeding boats, wind farm operational noise, and other synthetic signals projected in the medium using a broadband underwater projector. The monitoring system design was revealed as a successful methodological approach to record and quantify reactions to noise. The obtained results suggested that the observed reactions presented a strong relationship with insonification pressure level and time. Behavioral changes associated with noise are difficult to observe, especially in semi-free conditions; thus, the presented approach offered the opportunity to link anthropogenic activity with possible effects on a given marine species, suggesting the possibility of achieving a more realistic framework to assess the impacts of underwater noise on marine animals.

AB  - Purpose - Poor indoor air quality in schools is a worldwide challenge that poses health risks to pupils and teachers. A possible response to this problem is to modify ventilation. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to pilot a process of generating alternatives for ventilation redesign, in an early project phase, for a school to be refurbished. Here, severe problems in indoor air quality have been found in the school.
   Design/methodology/approach - Ventilation redesign is investigated in a case study of a school, in which four alternative ventilation strategies are generated and evaluated. The analysis is mainly based on the data gathered from project meetings, site visits and the documents provided by ventilation and condition assessment consultants.
   Findings - Four potential strategies to redesign ventilation in the case school are provided for decision-making in refurbishment in the early project phase. Moreover, the research presents several features to be considered when planning the ventilation strategy of an existing school, including the risk of alterations in air pressure through structures; the target number of pupils in classrooms; implementing and operating costs; and the size of the space that ventilation equipment requires.
   Research limitations/implications - As this study focusses on the early project phase, it provides viewpoints to assist decision-making, but the final decision requires still more accurate calculations and simulations.
   Originality/value - This study demonstrates the decision-making process of ventilation redesign of a school with indoor air problems and provides a set of features to be considered. Hence, it may be beneficial for building owners and municipal authorities who are engaged in planning a refurbishment of an existing building.

AB  - Fungal contamination of agricultural commodities, particularly by mycotoxigenic fungi, repre-sents an enormous concern for global food security in terms of feeding the world's growing pop-ulation with sufficient and safe food. Not only do they reduce crop yield and quality, but they also produce substantial numbers of mycotoxins, which pose serious adverse health effects in human and animals. As the genome of most mycotoxigenic species have been sequenced, the gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of agriculturally important mycotoxins including aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins, zearalenone and trichothecenes, have been largely identi-fied and characterised, with their roles elucidated by researchers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of genes involved in the biosynthetic path-ways of mycotoxins. In addition, the influence of climatic factors including water, temperature and carbon dioxide on differential mycotoxin gene expressions have been highlighted. Overall, the relationship between the relative expression of key regulatory and structural genes under different environmental conditions is significantly correlated with mycotoxins production. This indicates that mycotoxin gene induction can be used as a reliable indicator or marker to monitor mycotoxin production pre-and-post harvest. Furthermore, current strategies to manage mycotoxin risks still require improvement. Thus, an accurate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mycotoxin biosynthesis in mycotoxigenic species could help to develop an innovative, robust targeted control strategy. This could include the exploitation of novel compounds, which can inhibit biosynthetic genes, to minimise mycotoxin risks. (c) 2021 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is the principal vector of medically-important infectious viruses that cause severe illness such as dengue fever, yellow fever and Zika. The transmission potential of mosquitoes for these arboviruses is largely shaped by their life history traits, such as size, survival and fecundity. These life history traits, to some degree, depend on environmental conditions, such as larval and adult nutrition (e.g., nectar availability). Both these types of nutrition are known to affect the energetic reserves and life history traits of adults, but whether and how nutrition obtained during larval and adult stages have an interactive influence on mosquito life history traits remains largely unknown. Results Here, we experimentally manipulated mosquito diets to create two nutritional levels at larval and adult stages, that is, a high or low amount of larval food (HL or LL) during larval stage, and a good and poor adult food (GA or PA, represents normal or weak concentration of sucrose) during adult stage. We then compared the size, survival and fecundity of female mosquitoes reared from these nutritional regimes. We found that larval and adult nutrition affected size and survival, respectively, without interactions, while both larval and adult nutrition influenced fecundity. There was a positive relationship between fecundity and size. In addition, this positive relationship was not affected by nutrition. Conclusions These findings highlight how larval and adult nutrition differentially influence female mosquito life history traits, suggesting that studies evaluating nutritional effects on vectorial capacity traits should account for environmental variation across life stages.

AB  - Today, the adaptation to the effects of changing behavior and attitudes of Algerian companies has become a necessity. The current work aims to provide real-time information drawn from the field involvement with the use of performance indicators, in order to have a global vision of the general situation of the company. This allows for fulfilling functions such as awareness, guidance, decision support, and strategic planning. These indicators form a key data synthesis that affects all areas of the company's affairs. Based on these indicators, a manager could have a better view of the business. Consequently, he could act effectively to correct the errors that have been revealed or continue in increasing the company's development. This article describes the progress of management practices improvement in a foundry of the ETRAG company while relying on employee involvement. Through this work, the necessary preventive measures are established in the occupational environment ensuring the health and safety of employees. Thus, the well-being of the employees and the improvement of the working conditions can be assessed. The proposed work methodology consists of two components: the survey results obtained through a questionnaire in order to quantify the most exposed to risks and its intersection employees with the solutions proposed by the same employees. This approach aims at optimizing processes, instill a culture to the effects of changing attitudes and behaviors, to spread the culture of continuous and sustainable progress within a company, to ensure a good workplace atmosphere, and to have a respectful attitude towards employees.

AB  - The Three-North Shelter Forest Program (TNSFP) region of China is an important ecological region covering more than 42.4% of China's land area. Several ecological restoration projects have been implemented in this region, but evaluation work is relatively limited partly due to the selection of suitable remote sensing products. In this study, leaf area index is proposed as a suitable indicator to evaluate the ecological restoration situation as it is an indicator reflects the growth of green vegetations. The Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI dataset and land cover dataset from 2000 to 2015 were adopted and analyzed in this study. The forest cover area slightly increased, while the grassland area decreased. Although large-scale forestation movements were carried out across the entire TNSFP region, the forest growth conditions mainly improved in regions with an annual precipitation greater than 400 mm. Furthermore, LAI-precipitation correlations were very high (r greater than 0.6) in the regions across 400 mm isohyets, but lower (r < 0.4) far away from 400 mm isohyets. In relatively arid regions, forest growth did not show an obvious increase trend and sometimes a decrease trend. The increase in the LAI of these regions was mainly due to the restoration of grassland. Therefore, although LAI in most of the TNSFP region showed increasing trends, it is still not sufficient to state that these trends were caused by forestation projects in China.

AB  - Aim. Study of a group of biochemical parameters of the hepatopancreas and gills of the Black Sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam. and the functional indicator of cardiac system adaptivity of mussels from Sevastopol bays with different levels of recreational and anthropogenic impact.
   Methods. Mussels were collected from four Sevastopol water areas (Kruglaya Bay, Kazachya Bay, Matyushenko Bay and Cape Khrustalnii) in autumn 2018. The bioindication methods used were based on application of functional (cardiac system adaptability) and biochemical indicators (antioxidant enzymes activity [AEA], aminotransferases, the alkaline phosphatase [AP], and products of the lipid peroxidation [LPO] and protein oxidation [PO]) of mussel tissues. The hydrochemical parameters of the investigated areas were determined.
   Results. The anthropogenic impact on a complex of biochemical indicators of mussels at the sampling sites was shown. At the same time, low values of mussel heart rate (HR) recovery time (Trec) (less than 60 min.) in all sampling sites demonstrated the efficiency of biochemical changes in mussels and the possible use of all tested bays as recreational areas.
   Conclusion. Results of the present research allow the characterization of the ecological status of these Sevastopol sea water areas and to make recommendations about their rational use. Matyushenko and Kazachya Bays are most suitable for beach recreation and recreational fishery. Kazachya Bay also has favourable conditions for the development of water sports. Kruglaya Bay and Cape Khrustalnii are less ecologically safe and require a series of actions to improve water quality.

AB  - One of the most common tools in conservation physiology is the assessment of environmental stress via glucocorticoid measurement. However, little is known of its relationship with other stress-related biomarkers, and how the incidence of an immune challenge during long-term stress could affect an individual's overall stress response. We investigated here the relationship between basal and post-acute stress fecal cortisol metabolite (FC) with different antioxidant enzymes, oxidative damage and immune parameters in the fish-eating bat, Myotis vivesi. We found that in both basal and post-stress conditions, FC was highly related with a number of antioxidant enzymes and immune parameters, but not to oxidative damage. We also assessed changes of FC through the seasons. Basal FC samples and stress reactivity after short-duration stress displayed similar levels during summer, autumn and early winter, but lower concentrations in late winter. Stress reactivity after long-duration stress was greater in summer and early winter. Finally, we tested the effect of a simultaneous exposure to a long, strong stress stimulus with an immune response stimulation by administrating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) after 42 h. Results showed that when both stimuli were administrated, FC concentrations, inflammation and some antioxidant activity were lowered in comparison with the control and individual administration of the challenges. Our findings support the idea that animals maintain constant basal glucocorticoid levels when living in challenging environments, but response to acute stress differs seasonally and immune defense mechanisms and stress responses might be compromised when confronted with multiple challenges.

AB  - Analysis of the transcriptome of organisms exposed to toxicants offers new insights for ecotoxicology, but further research is needed to enhance interpretation of results and effectively incorporate them into useful environmental risk assessments. Factors that must be clarified to improve use of transcriptomics include assessment of the effect of organism sex within the context of toxicant exposure. Amphipods are well recognized as model organisms for toxicity evaluation because of their sensitivity and amenability to laboratory conditions. To investigate whether response to metals in crustaceans differs according to sex we analyzed the amphipod Parhyale hawaiensis after exposure to AgCl and Ag nanoparticles (AgNP) via contaminated food. Gene specific analysis and whole genome transcriptional profile of male and female organisms were performed by both RT-qPCR and RNA-seq. We observed that expression of transcripts of genes glutathione transferase (GST) did not differ among AgCl and AgNP treatments. Significant differences between males and females were observed after exposure to AgCl and AgNP. Males presented twice the number of differentially expressed genes in comparison to females, and more differentially expressed were observed after exposure to AgNP than AgCl treatments in both sexes. The genes that had the greatest change in expression relative to control were those genes related to peptidase and catalytic activity and chitin and carbohydrate metabolic processes. Our study is the first to demonstrate sex specific differences in the transcriptomes of amphipods upon exposure to toxicants and emphasizes the importance of considering gender in ecotoxicology.

AB  - The information of diet, habitat and geographic location of animals obtained from fossil deposits is important to understand the environmental changes of a place that occurred through time. Most of the paleoecological research in Mexico is centered on large mammal taxa. A minimal research effort is allocated to small vertebrates which due to their relative brief longevity and small territories, provide fine-scale paleoenvironmental information. In the present work, the occlusal morphology of the first molar was analyzed, as well as the dental microwear marks and the Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratio in fossil and extant relatives of the genus Sigmodon from La Cinta-Portalitos locality, situated on the northern portion of the Cuitzeo Basin, central western Mexico. Goals included determining species richness within Sigmodon, as well as dietary behavior and geographic origin. Based on the comparison of the occlusal morphology of fossils and modern teeth, three fossil species were distinguished: S. hispidus, S. leucotis and S. alleni. Microwear patterns showed that S. hispidus population could be associated to a grazer diet, inhabiting open areas, similar to the extant populations. The species S. leucotis exhibited a microwear signature associated to a grazer diet as well, and S. alleni revealed a fruit-grass-insect feeding behavior. Finally, in the case of S. hispidus, the Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic signature proved to be like that of the bedrock, so the S. hispidus population was local and a suitable indicator of paleoenvironmental conditions of La Cinta-Portalitos.

AB  - Agricultural production inevitably poses adverse impacts on local environment, while the collective action of farmers can also contribute positively to sustainable resources management. The structural component of economic actors' integration is often related to social capital. This study analyses the impacts of farmers' socioeconomic conditions on energy use and life cycle environmental impacts of Iranian rice production. Based on the local socio-economic status and life cycle assessment, some types of social capital groups are suggested to achieve cooperative rice production with lower burden on the environment. Four social capital groups, namely "water, fertilizer and pesticide users", "consolidated farming", "new technology users" and "micro-finance", are suggested according to the life cycle assessment. The members of each social capital group were determined by data envelopment analysis to guarantee that each social capital group moves toward better rice production methods with lower burden on the environment. Technical efficiency of farmers was determined by data envelopment analysis models which in turn help us identify core and target members of each social capital group. The results show that the lowest energy input for rice production is 28,000 MJ/ha, which appeared in groups with medium aged farmers who have medium farming experiences. The sample farmers with higher net income, larger farms and participating in extensional classes contribute to mitigate total energy consumption of rice production. The life cycle assessment confirms that those socio-economic groups consuming lower energy also impose lower burden on the environment.

AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize the main operational processes adopted by a shrimp aquaculture pond system in Brazil and to account the flows of energy use. The characterization was carried out via application of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRIMA) methodology. The accounting of the energy flows was made through the quantification of the energy coming from economically required resources. Based on the data and characteristics identified in Brazilian shrimp farms, a hypothetical farm consisting of four nursery tanks, nine ponds, feed, fertilizer and general deposits, a refectory, restrooms and dressing rooms, garage, and main and secondary access roads. In this hypothetical shrimp farm, the water pumping was performed by a 20 hp pump, and aeration was performed via 4 hp paddle-type aerators. A biphasic operating system and a semi-intensive production regime were adopted, with a initial stocking density of 43 shrimp m(-2) and harvest occurring when the shrimp reached an average weight of 12 g. The cultivation cycle lasted 90 days and include the pond preparation and curing period. The final yield was estimated to be 3500 kg ha(-1). The total energy cost was calculated as 835.597 MJ. The most energy inputs were feed, fuels and lubricants and electricity. Shrimp production in ponds is a very intensive activity relative to the energy demand and that increasing energy efficiency is one of the essential conditions for the truly sustainable production of long-term Brazilian shrimp farming not only for environmental but also mainly for economic reasons.

AB  - The temperature-humidity index (THI) has been extensively applied for assessing heat stress in moderate to hot conditions in dairy cattle. However, there exist wide variation between researchers in defining an appropriate range of THI values for denoting different levels of stress. The present study was aimed to reassess previously described heat stress indicators of dairy cattle of sub-tropical region of India. From comparative evaluation of meteorological data over previous four years (2014-2017) the period of year when high THI prevailed in the region was determined. Accordingly, the time period of sample collection and observation on animals was decided, so that a THI range of 68-86 could be covered. After analyzing physiological, biochemical parameters and expression profile of heat shock response (HSR) genes of animals in response to different THI, it was evident from the study that animal undergoes few or little changes at THI 72, but major physiological changes occurred after THI reached 74. At THI range 74-79, no drastic change in these parameters occurred suggesting animals undergo transient acclimatization in this range to maintain homeostasis. Once THI reached and crossed 80, this homeostasis was perturbed and animals experienced major physiological changes again. Overall, the study suggests that THI values indicating level of heat stress are dependent on the geographic location, as well as type of animal and therefore, existing THI should be recalibrated for different climatic region for accurate assessment of the heat stress.

AB  - Nitrobenzene (NB) is one of the most challenging pollutants for groundwater remediation due to its great harm and recalcitrance. Emulsified nanoscale zero-valent iron (EZVI) is considered as a promising agent for in-situ remediation of contaminated groundwater for its high reactivity, good durability and low cost. In this paper, 2D tank experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced remediation of NB-contaminated groundwater with EZVI. 9 L of EZVI solution was injected into aquifer to establish in situ reactive zone (IRZ) before 40 d of NB contamination. Results indicate that injection of EZVI leads to 90% reduction of total NB, which is mainly converted to aniline (AN). NB concentration decreases along the flow path in the tank. Fe2+ is generated from Fe oxidation. Significant acetate and bicarbonate are released due to emulsified oil decomposition during the whole operation time. Groundwater pH maintains in neutral value (6.6-8.2) owing to the balance between organic acids and OH- released after iron oxidation. Drastic decrease of ORP and DO indicates the transformation from oxidizing to reducing condition, leading to the reduction of oxidative species (e.g. sulfate, nitrate) in subsurface. Calculation of reducing equivalents suggests that microbial breakdown of emulsified oil provides more electrons than Fe oxidation does to the system. Both biotic and abiotic processes are involved in the enhanced degradation of NB. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indicators and metric systems are crucial tools in efforts to reach societal objectives, and these systems are being employed increasingly in initiatives to improve the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of agri-food systems. Indicators can help clarify values and objectives, providing assessment criteria useful for tracking movement toward or away from targets. Unfortunately, the application of indicators and metrics to agricultural systems has been hindered by conflicting definitions of agricultural sustainability and progress, leading to metrics that lack a holistic consideration of social, economic, and environmental factors. To address this shortcoming, we argue for a definition of progressive agriculture that includes all three of the abovementioned factors, stressing the need for multidimensional improvements in the impact of agri-food systems. Our proposed Progressive Agriculture Index (PAI) integrates data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture, the U.S. Census, and other databases to assess nine variables at the county level for the contiguous United States. Including data from both 2007 and 2012 permits analysis of time trends along with regional and county-level trends in individual and aggregate measures of progressivity. By ranking counties within their Farm Resource Regions (as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] Economic Research Service [ERS]), as well as within their Urban Influence Categories, the PAI also makes it possible to compare counties with similar socioeconomic and environmental contexts. Given the important goal of improving social, economic, and environmental conditions in concert, we present this index to draw attention back to the oftenneglected social facets of progressivity and thus contribute to advancing more integrated, participatory approaches to measuring progress in agri-food systems.

AB  - We examine the impact of +1.5 degrees C and +2 degrees C global warming levels above pre-industrial levels on consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD), two key indicators for extreme precipitation and seasonal drought. This is done using climate projections from a multi-model ensemble of 25 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. The RCMs take boundary conditions from ten global climate models (GCMs) under the RCP8.5 scenario. We define CDD as the maximum number of consecutive days with rainfall amount less than 1 mm and CWD as the maximum number of consecutive days with rainfall amount more than 1 mm. The differences in model representations of the change in CDD and CWD, at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming, and based on the control period 1971-2000 are reported. The models agree on a noticeable response to both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming for each index. Enhanced warming results in a reduction in mean rainfall across the region. More than 80% of ensemble members agree that CDD will increase over the Guinea Coast, in tandem with a projected decrease in CWD at both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming levels. These projected changes may influence already fragile ecosystems and agriculture in the region, both of which are strongly affected by mean rainfall and the length of wet and dry periods.

AB  - Despite the many recognised benefits, the application of high rate algal ponds (HRAP) to manage wastewater treatment in small communities has been limited. To be incorporated into the South Australian Community Wastewater Management Scheme (CWMS), new wastewater treatment systems are required to undergo validation and obtain regulatory approval from the South Australian Department of Health, Wastewater Management Group. A HRAP system at Kingston on Murray, South Australia, underwent validation to be incorporated into the CWMS. The process was consistent with the Australian National Guidelines which requires the demonstration of the log(10) reduction values (LRV) for indicator organisms achieved by the wastewater treatment system. These were required to be measured twice weekly, over a 10 week period in below average solar radiation and temperature conditions, by an independent National Association of Testing Authorities accredited laboratory. The Australian Water Quality Centre was commissioned to assess the removal of Escherichia coli, F-RNA bacteriophage and aerobic spore-forming bacteria. Flinders University of South Australia concurrently monitored the removal of the same organisms and other standard wastewater parameters. While ASFB were shown to be unsuitable indicators of protozoa in natural pond systems, the system effectively removed E. coli and F-RNA bacteriophage with the treated effluent meeting the limits set by the guidelines for effluent reuse for non-food crop irrigation: a 5th percentile LRV of >1.0 for F-RNA bacteriophage and a median E. coli concentration of <4.0 log(10) E. coli MPN 100 mL(-1). Based on these results two configurations of HRAP systems were approved to be incorporated into the CWMS.

AB  - Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a cosmopolitan, necrotrophic and soil borne plant pathogen, capable of infecting many economically important crops. Although it is a well studied pathogen elsewhere, there is no research conducted in Sri Lanka. The objectives of the current research were to study the phenotypic variations among isolates within the pathogen population in the upcountry commercial cabbage fields in Sri Lanka and to determine their sensitivity to a commonly applied fungicide, Mancozeb. Forty-six isolates obtained from infected cabbage heads were identified as S. sclerotiortan based on its unique morphological characteristics. Colony diameter was measured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 23 degrees C and mycelial colour was observed after two-week incubation. All the isolates were grown in pH indicator media to determine their acid producing abilities. Sensitivity of the isolates to Mancozeb was assayed in vitro. There was a significant difference in colony growth among the isolates and sensitivity to Mancozeb. Two isolates showed abnonnal mycelial growth characteristics: a slower growth rate on PDA and reduced pathogenicity on cabbage leaves. Two levels of mycelial pigmentation were observed on PDA. All the isolates were acid producers, inferring that all of them were pathogenic. In summary, the upcountry S. sclerotiorum pathogen population was found to be diverse for selected phenotypic traits, especially for mycelial growth, and fungicide sensitivities inferring that the pathogen population is capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, disease management will be challenging if an epidemic occurs, and it is recommended that a proper management system should be identified before further expansion of upcountry cabbage cultivation.

AB  - The factors affecting plant uptake of heavy metals from metalliferous soils are deeply important to the remediation of polluted areas. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), soil-dwelling fungi that engage in an intimate exchange of nutrients with plant roots, are thought to be involved in plant metal uptake as well. Here, we used a novel field-based approach to investigate the effects of AMF on plant metal uptake from soils in Palmerton, Pennsylvania, USA contaminated with heavy metals from a nearby zinc smelter. Previous studies often focus on one or two plant species or metals, tend to use highly artificial growing conditions and metal applications, and rarely consider metals' effects on plants and AMF together. In contrast, we examined both direct and AMF-mediated effects of soil concentrations on plant concentrations of 8-13 metals in five wild plant species sampled across a field site with continuous variation in Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cu contamination. Plant and soil metal concentration profiles were closely matched despite high variability in soil metal concentrations even at small spatial scales. However, we observed few effects of soil metals on AMF colonization, and no effects of AMF colonization on plant metal uptake. Manipulating soil chemistry or plant community composition directly may control landscape-level plant metal uptake more effectively than altering AMF communities. Plant species identities may serve as highly local indicators of soil chemical characteristics.

AB  - Recently, a protein sequence database was built specifically for the sentinel non-model species Gommarus fosswurn using a proteogenomics approach. A quantitative multiplexed targeted proteomics assay (using Selected Reaction Monitoring mass spectrometry) was then developed for a fast and simultaneous quantification of dozens of biomarker peptides specific of this freshwater sentinel crustacean species. In order to assess the relevance of this breakthrough methodology in ecotoxicology, the response patterns of a panel of 26 peptides reporting for 20 proteins from the Gammarus fossarum proteome with putative key functional roles (homeostasis, osmoregulation, nutrition, reproduction, molting,...) were recorded through male and female reproductive cycles and after exposure to environmental concentrations of cadmium and lead in laboratory-controlled conditions. Based on these results, we validated the implication of annotated vtg-like peptides in the oogenesis process, and the implication of Na+/K+ ATPase proteins in the molt cycle of organisms. Upon metal (cadmium and lead) contamination, peptides belonging to proteins annotated as involved in antioxidant and detoxification functions, immunity and molting were significantly down-regulated. Overall, this multiplex assay allowed gaining relevant insights upon disruption of different main functions in the sentinel species Gammarus fossarurn. This breakthrough methodology in ecotoxicology offers a valid and high throughput alternative to currently used protocols, paving the way for future practical applications of proteogenomics-derived protein biomarkers in chemical risk assessment and environmental monitoring.

AB  - Recycling is one of the most preferable tools of the sustainability concept considering its economic benefits and environmental effects. However, environmental and economic benefits are not always enough to accomplish a sustainable life concept. Social impacts, which basically focus on issues such as the well-being of humans, should be also considered. Regarding this concept; in this study we aimed to analyze the social impacts of different packaging waste management systems. In this context, we proposed eleven scenarios, which consisted of hypothetical formal and informal collection scenarios. All these scenarios were compared with the currently applied collection system in Istanbul, Turkey. The social analysis was conducted by using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. The results of this study showed that existing system and informal collection scenarios had socially fewer score than the formal scenarios in almost all impacts. Between the formal collection systems, there were slight differences caused by especially working conditions and socio-economic repercussion. However, formal collection scenarios showed more negative social impacts than formal-informal system integration. The result of this study showed that it was crucial to consider an amelioration on the informal collection system. In the integrated scenario (S11), some of the critical subcategories were idealized and improved taking into consideration to the long term modification issues. Although we couldn't minimize all negative social impacts; it was obvious that this scenario was still the best option. Finally, we may conclude that application of an ameliorated informal collection system would be socially more beneficial than formal and informal collection systems.

AB  - Introduction
   Brazil has a large semiarid region, which covers part of 9 states, over 20% of the 5565 municipalities in the country and at 22.5 million persons, 12% of the country's population. This region experiences recurrent and extended droughts and is characterized by low economic development, scarcity of natural resources including water, and difficult agricultural and livestock production. Local governments and communities need easily obtainable tools to aid their decision making process in managing risks associated with drought.
   Methods
   To inform decision-making at the level of municipalities, we investigated factors contributing to the health risks of drought. We used education and poverty indicators to measure vulnerability, number of drought damage evaluations and historical drought occurrences as indicators of hazard, and access to water as an indicator of exposure, to derive a drought disaster risk index.
   Results
   Indicators such as access to piped water, illiteracy and poverty show marked differences in most states and, in nearly all states, the living conditions of communities in the semiarid region are worse than in the rest of each state. There are municipalities at high drought disaster risk in every state and there are a larger number of municipalities at higher risks from the center to the north of the semiarid region.
   Conclusions
   Understanding local hazards, exposures and vulnerabilities provides the means to understand local communities' risks and develop interventions to reduce them. In addition, communities in these regions need to be empowered to add their traditional knowledge to scientific tools, and to identify the actions most relevant to their needs and realities.

AB  - While decreasing occurrence and duration of lake ice cover is well-documented, biogeochemical dynamics in frozen lakes remain poorly understood. Here, we interpret winter physical and biogeochemical time series from eutrophic Missisquoi Bay (MB) and hyper-eutrophic Shelburne Pond (SP) to describe variable drivers of under ice biogeochemistry in systems of fundamentally different lake-watershed physical configurations (lake area, lake:watershed area). The continuous cold of the 2015 winter drove the MB sediment-water interface to the most severe and persistent suboxic state ever documented at this site, promoting the depletion of redox-sensitive phases in sediments, and an expanding zone of bottom water enriched in reactive species of Mn, Fe, and P. In this context, lake sediment and water column inventories of reactive chemical species were sensitive to the severity and persistence of subfreezing temperatures. During thaws, event provenance and severity impact lake thermal structure and mixing, water column enrichment in P and Fe, and thaw capability to suppress redox front position and internal chemical loading. Nearly identical winter weather manifest differently in nearby SP, where the small surface and watershed areas promoted a warmer, less stratified water column and active phytoplankton populations, impacting biogeochemical dynamics. In SP, Fe and P behavior under ice were decoupled due to active biological cycling, and thaw impacts were different in distribution and composition due to SP's physical structure and related antecedent conditions. We find that under ice biogeochemistry is highly dynamic in both time and space and sensitive to a variety of drivers impacted by climate change.

AB  - Drought stress is one of the most severe environmental constraints to plant growth and crop productivity. Plant growth is greatly affected by drought stress, and plants, to survive, adapt to this stress by invoking different pathways. Piriformospora indica, a root-colonizing endophytic fungus of Sebacinales, promotes plant growth and confers resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, including drought stress, by affecting the physiological properties of the host plant. The fungus strongly colonizes the roots of maize (Zea mays L.) and promotes shoot and root growth under both normal growth conditions and drought stress. We used polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) to mimic drought stress and found that root fresh and dry weight, leaf area, SPAD value, and leaf number were increased in P. indica-colonized plants. The antioxidative activities of catalases and superoxide dismutases were upregulated within 24 h in the leaves of P. indica-colonized plants. Drought-related genes DREB2A, CBL1, ANAC072, and RD29A were upregulated in drought-stressed leaves of P. indica-colonized plants. Furthermore, after drought treatment, proline content increased, whereas accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of membrane damage, decreased in P. indica-colonized maize. We conclude that P. indica-mediated plant protection against the detrimental effects of drought may result from enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, proline accumulation, and expression of drought-related genes and lower membrane damage in maize plants.

AB  - The performance of buffer zones for removing pesticides from runoff water varies greatly according to landscape settings, hydraulic regime, and system design. Evaluating the performance of buffers for a range of pesticides and environmental conditions can be very expensive. Recent studies suggested that the fluorescent dyes uranine and sulforhodamine B could be used as cost-effective surrogates of herbicides to evaluate buffer performance. However, while transformation mechanisms in buffers have been extensively documented, sorption processes of both dyes have rarely been investigated. In this study, we measured the adsorption, desorption, and kinetic sorption coefficients of uranine and sulforhodamine B for a diverse range of buffer zone materials (soils, litters, plants) and compared the adsorption coefficients (Kd) to those of selected herbicides. We also compared the global sorption capacity of 6 ditches, characterized by varying proportions of the aforementioned materials, between both dyes and a set of four herbicides using the sorption-induced pesticide retention indicator (SPRI). We found that both the individual Kd of uranine for the diverse buffer materials and the global sorption capacity of the ditches are equivalent to those of the herbicides diuron, isoproturon, and metolachlor. The Kd of sulforhodamine B on plants and soils are equivalent to those of glyphosate, and the global sorption capacities of the ditches are equivalent for both molecules. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time that uranine can be used as a proxy of moderately hydrophobic herbicides to evaluate the performance of buffer systems, whereas sulforhodamine B can serve as a proxy for more strongly sorbing herbicides.

AB  - Field-relevant reference driving cycles, equivalent to real-life operation, are a prerequisite for the consistent development and testing of vehicles, their components, and control algorithms. Furthermore they are the basis for certification and type testing. However, a static cycle can easily be detected during vehicle testing, so that optimized control parameters could be used to obtain improved emission results under test conditions. In this paper, a novel method is described and applied to generate a dynamic driving cycle that statistically matches the real-life operation of a vehicle. The analysis is performed based on an extensive field data set obtained during an automated measurement campaign of public busses for more than a full year with 27,365 h of operation and 315,583 km driven in the city of Hamburg (Germany). The data collected is statistically compared to the static reference cycles New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and Worldwide harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). Two micro trip models with increasing complexity are described and fit to the data set. All models are quantitatively compared to the measured data set applying a Quality of Fit (QoF) indicator. Based on the highest consistency to field data, a non-deterministic driving cycle generator is developed and its output is statistically compared to the original measurement. In contrast to the existing reference cycles, the dynamic output of the non-deterministic driving cycle generator presented in this paper is statistically proven to be consistent with real-life operation of public busses in the urban environment of Hamburg.

AB  - Carotenoid-based ornaments have been proposed to signal the ability to find food. The good-parent hypothesis suggests that females may rely on these carotenoid-based traits to assess male parental quality. A key question is whether the quality of these ornaments correlates with their performance at the moment of breeding. In this study, we assessed the parental investment of Mediterranean Great Tits Parus major in the early morning as a function of several environmental factors and of parental ornamentation. We measured this by the time that parents started feeding their offspring at the start of the day. In the morning, parents need to rapidly respond to the food demands of their offspring, after a long night without food. An earlier start of provisioning could indicate higher parental investment (and/or greater foraging ability). Our data indicate that fathers that show higher hue in their carotenoid-based plumage more greenish individuals - started feeding their offspring earlier, thereby expanding the time window in which they work, while females did not show a significant relationship between the onset of provisioning and ornamentation. Parents, particularly mothers, that started earlier, worked more intensely across the whole observation period. Furthermore, parents started earlier when they had larger broods. Finally, more ornamented parents worked at lower rates, while more ornamented mothers raised offspring that had better body condition, which is in line with the good parent hypothesis. Although our results indicate that more ornamented males start feeding their offspring earlier, overall we found mixed support for the hypothesis that carotenoid-based ornaments signal the parental quality of a mate.

AB  - In order to determine the variability of food waste (FW) characteristics and the influence of these variable values on the anaerobic digestion (AD) process, FW characteristics from 70 papers were compiled and analysed statistically. Results indicated that FW characteristics values are effectively very variable and that 24% of these variations may be explained by the geographical origin, the type of collection source and the season of the collection. Considering the whole range of values for physicochemical characteristics (especially volatile solids (VS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biomethane potential (BMP)), FW show good potential for AD treatment. However, the high carbohydrates contents (36.4%VS) and the low pH (5.1) might cause inhibitions by the rapid acidification of the digesters. As regards the variation of FW characteristics, FW categories were proposed. Moreover, the adequacy of FW characteristics with AD treatment was discussed. Four FW categories were identified with critical characteristics values for AD performance: (1) the high dry matter (DM) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) content of FW collected with green waste, (2) the high cellulose (CEL) content of FW from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, (3) the low carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of FW collected during summer, (4) the high value of TAN and Na of FW from Asia. For these cases, an aerobic pre-treatment or a corrective treatment seems to be advised to avoid instabilities along the digestion. Finally, the results of this review-paper provide a data basis of values for FW characteristics that could be used for AD process design and environmental assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reuse of wastewater is a sustainable and renewable source of water, mainly used in the agricultural sector and can contribute to rural development. Agriculture is the second highest sector for water consumption in the Gaza Strip, using more than 50% of water abstractions from the stressed polluted Gaza's coastal aquifer. This paper aims to present and evaluate two available wastewater post-treatment options which could be employed to reuse wastewater for agriculture in Gaza: sand filtration using a textured geomembrane sand filter and the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) system. This evaluation is based on applying hierarchy grey relational analysis and the comparison matrix through an environmental assessment for each option using a semi-empirical methodology that combines results from field tests and computer hydrological simulations. In addition, it is based on a social and economic and the operational aspects for the Gaza City Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and its infiltration basin. The evaluation factors for the two options are juxtaposed in a Comparison Matrix with associated weighted scores and predefined scales to quantify the evaluation process before using the hierarchy grey relational analysis. The results show that the operational costs and the environmental aspects are the main factors that affect the evaluation process for wastewater post-treatment options. The sand filtration (with textured geomembrane) option is ranked higher than the SAT system for this particular case study with an overall integrated grey relational grade equal to 0.3276, compared to 0.2596 for the SAT system.

AB  - Recycling of organic wastes within agriculture may help maintain soil fertility via effects on physical, chemical and biological properties. This study examines the effect of sewage sludge application on soil biochemical properties. Dewatered anaerobically digested sewage sludge were collected from the sewage treatment plants in 9 different regions of Turkey (Izmir, Gaziantep, Samsun, Antalya, Elazig, Karamursel, Ankara, Yozgat, and Duzce) were chosen and surface soils (0-20 cm) were also taken from the agricultural lands of these regions. We studied the effects of adding different doses (0, 2, 4 and 8 t dry matter (DM) da(-1)) of sewage sludge on selected soil characteristics. Soils treated with sludges were incubated under constant laboratory conditions at 25 degrees C for 0, 60 and 120 days. As a result; the addition of different doses of sludge caused a rapid and significant increasing of soil enzymatic activities, soil biomass, soil respiration and q CO2, these increases were especially noticeable in soil treated with high doses of sludge. Sludge application somewhat increased soil enzyme activities. In addition, a significant (P<0.05) variations in soil respiration were also observed in this study. The highest rate of sludge application (8 tha(-1)) was found to significantly (P<0.05) increase the functional diversity of the soil community. These results suggest that although the sludge application resulted increasing in the diversity of the microbial activity, the overall size of the soil microbial biomass, CO2 production and qCO(2) values were either unchanged or increased.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine drinking water on three farms in eastern Slovakia and to determine experimentally the optimum dose for adequate disinfection in terms of devitalisation of potential pathogens while observing the limit for residual active chlorine (0.3 mg/l) in drinking water. Our investigations included bacteriological examination focused on general contamination and indicator bacteria (bacteria cultivated at 22 and 37 degrees C, total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci), physico-chemical examination (pH, ammonium ions, nitrites, nitrates, chlorides, free chlorine, chemical oxygen demand CODMn and Ca + Mg), and EEM (excitation emission matrix) fluorescence spectroscopy which focused on the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). After determining the optimum single dose of Chloramine T for disinfection of water used for watering of animals, the bacteriological quality of water was checked on the 5th day after the disinfection. The results showed that water quality was better on Farm No. 3 than on Farms No. 1 and No. 2. The weather (precipitation) evidently affected the quality of water on all three farms and was associated with some risk to animals consuming this water. The experimentally determined doses of Chloramine T appeared relatively efficient on Farm No. 1 and Farm No. 3, while the Chloramine T dose estimated for adequate disinfection on Farm No. 2 had to be increased considerably but was still much lower than the dose recommended by the manufacturer of this preparation. It appeared effective to adjust the intervals between individual chlorine treatments according to weather conditions (heavy rain) instead of increasing the active chlorine dose.

AB  - On the basis of macrofossil and pollen analyses, AMS C-14-dating, and geomorphological investigations, we reconstructed the development of hydrological changes during the Lateglacial to early Holocene transition in Tuchola Pinewoods (Bory Tucholskie) in northern Poland. In this region, the Wda River flows in polygenetic valleys, typical for the young glacial landscape of the northern central European lowlands. The middle section of this river provides a suitable setting to demonstrate the environmental and hydrological changes in the Late Glacial and early Holocene, because (1) it is a small and well-defined area and (2) the existence of a morphologically preserved river valley from late glacial period. In this study, we focused on a short terrestrial sediment core (48 cm) that represents four phases of landscape evolution during the early Holocene: telmatic, lacustrine, lacustrine-fluvial and alluvial. Abrupt changes in lithology and sediment structures exhibit rapid changes and threshold processes in environmental conditions. The AMS C-14 dating of terrestrial plant remains revealed an age for the basal sediments of 11 223 +/- 23 cal BP and thus falls within the Preboreal biozone. Plant macrofossil indicators provide evidence of water level and edaphic changes in the basin. The results of our study demonstrate a strong influence of melting buried ice blocks on the geomorphological development, hydrological changes in the catchment, and the biotic environment in the early Holocene.

AB  - Polar ice sheets conserve atmospheric aerosols at the time of snowfall, which can be used to reconstruct past climate and environmental conditions. We investigated mineral dust and major ion records in snowpit samples obtained from the northwestern Greenland ice sheet near the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) camp in June 2009. We analyzed the samples for mineral dust concentrations as well as stable water isotopes (delta O-18, delta D, and deuterium excess) and major ions (Cl-, SO42-, methanesulfonic acid (MSA), Na+ and Ca2+). Seasonal delta O-18 and delta D cycles indicate that the snowpit samples covered a six-year period from spring 2003 to early summer 2009. Concentrations of mineral dust, nss-Ca2+, and nss-SO42- showed seasonal deposition events with maxima in the winter spring layers. On the other hand, the Cl-/Na+ ratio and the concentrations of MSA exhibited maxima in the summer layers, making them useful indicators for the summer season. Moreover, an anomalous atmospheric mineral dust event was recorded at a depth of 165-170 cm corresponding to late winter 2005 to spring 2006. A back trajectory analysis suggests that a major contributor to the Greenland aerosol was an air mass passing over the Canadian Arctic and North America. Several trajectories point to Asian regions as a dust source. The mineral dust deposited at NEEM was strongly influenced by long-range atmospheric transport and dust input from arid source areas in northern China and Mongolia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recreational waters contaminated with human fecal pollution are a public health concern, and ensuring the safety of recreational waters for public use is a priority of both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Current recreational water standards rely on fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) levels as indicators of human disease risk. However present evidence indicates that levels of FIB do not always correspond to the presence of other potentially harmful organisms, such as viruses. Thus, enteric viruses are currently tested as water quality indicators, but have yet to be successfully implemented in routine monitoring of water quality. This study utilized enteric viruses as possible alternative indicators of water quality to examine 18 different fresh and offshore recreational waters on O'ahu, Hawai'i, by using newly established laboratory techniques including highly optimized PCR, real time PCR, and viral infectivity assays. All sample sites were detected positive for human enteric viruses by PCR including enterovirus, norovirus genogroups I and II, and male specific FRNA coliphage. A six time-point seasonal study of enteric virus presence indicated significant variation in virus detection between the rainy and dry seasons. Quantitative PCR detected the presence of norovirus genogroup II at levels at which disease risk may occur, and there was no correlation found between enteric virus presence and FIB counts. Under the present laboratory conditions, no infectious viruses were detected from the samples PCR-positive for enteric viruses. These data emphasize both the need for additional indicators for improved monitoring of water quality, and the feasibility of using enteric viruses as these indicators.

AB  - Interspecific comparison in metals and PAHs profile in three lichen species, Flavoparmelia caperata, Phaeophyscia hispidula and Pyxine sorediata, were studied in different altitudinal gradients of the Western Himalayas. The species collected from 14 sites, enroute from Dehradun to Morinda (243 Km) including the trekking route 42 Km from Taluka to Morinda having an altitudinal gradient between 850-3,750 m, were analysed for their metals and PAHs. The species showed similar metal as well as PAHs profile under similar altitudinal gradients in the sequence of F. caperata > P. hispidula > P. sorediata. The difference in pollutant concentrations within each lichen species may be related to intrinsic attributes of the species, such as thallus morphology and the presence of lichen substances which are responsible for the sensitivity and accumulation potential of a particular species. Novelty of the present study lies on the fact that all the species show a similar efficiency of reflecting the environmental condition of the area, albeit the coefficient values of individual species for individual pollutant obtained by three-factor ANOVA revealed that the bioaccumulation affinity of F. caperata is significantly higher than P. hispidula and P. sorediata. For individual metals, F. caperata has a higher affinity for Al, Cr, Fe, Pb and Zn while P. hispidula has a significant positive affinity for Fe and Pb. PCA analysis of sites with respect to pollutant revealed the segregation of sites based on source and distance. Combining the bioaccumulation potential parameters along with geostatistical (GIS) techniques establishes that F. caperata species is a better accumulator of metals and PAHs in comparison to P. hispidula and P. sorediata in the temperate regions of the Himalaya.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of heavy metal bioconcentration of the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) in Shadegan international wetland. Sampling including the water, waterbed sediment and mosquitofish was carried out from the selected sampling sites during October and November 2011, and analyzed by the ICP-OES. Results show that the water has poor qualitative condition, according to EPA and WHO water quality standards. The level of the water Cr in the selected sites in both months and the levels of Fe, Mn and Zn during October in the SW1 site were higher than the instrumental detection limits indicating that the water was contaminated with these metals in the mentioned sites and months. The levels of the waterbed sediment As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn, and mosquitofish Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Co and Cd were much higher than the instrumental detection limits, indicating that the waterbed sediment and mosquitofish were contaminated with them during October and November in the selected sites. Statistical assessments reveal that there is a significant difference between the mentioned contaminated water, waterbed sediment and mosquitofish heavy metals (all P-values < 0.05). In overall, it is considered that the contaminated heavy metals can be accumulated in the waterbed sediment and bioconcentrated in the wildlife tissues, then finally can be entered in the marine food chains and biomagnified there after long periods. In conclusion, this paper confirmed that the G. affinis can be used as a bioindicator of heavy metal pollution in marine ecosystems such as wetlands.

AB  - Palaeoenvironmental and C-14 reservoir age variability in the Limfjord, a sound through northern Jutland, Denmark, was investigated for the period 7300 to 1300 cal yr BP. Shells and bulk sediment samples from a core from a former inlet, Kilen, were analysed by radiocarbon dating and stable isotope (C/N) measurements. A strong correlation between the C/N ratios and C-13 values verifies that these are good carbon source indicators and thus allow environmental reconstructions. Furthermore, C-13 values are correlated with salinity in the photic zone, inferred quantitatively from diatom assemblages. They are therefore used to differentiate between brackish and marine palaeo-conditions. C-14 reservoir ages of shells vary from R=-140 to +300 C-14 years. Between 7300 and 5400 cal. yr BP, reservoir age and stable isotope values are highly variable and indicate mixing of marine water and brackish surface waters with hard water effects. After 5400 cal. yr BP, the R values stabilise and show an increasingly marine environment, with C-14 reservoir ages close to 400 years (R=0). After 2000 cal. yr BP, Kilen becomes brackish. Reservoir ages and stable isotope values are again highly variable and C-13 and C/N values are no longer correlated. Before 4000 cal. yr BP, N-15 values vary by only 1 parts per thousand and do not reflect the changes in the marine environment. A N-15 increase between 3500 and 2000 cal. yr BP signifies enhanced organic productivity or a change in agricultural practices.

AB  - Impacts of rising sea level on the hydraulic balance between aquifers and the ocean threaten fresh water resources and aquatic ecosystems along many world coastlines. Understanding the vulnerability of groundwater systems to these changes and the primary factors that determine the magnitude of system response is critical to developing effective management and adaptation plans in coastal zones. We assessed the vulnerability of two types of groundwater systems, recharge-limited and topography-limited, to changes caused by sea-level rise over a range of hydrogeologic settings. Vulnerability in this context is defined by the rate and magnitude of salinization of coastal aquifers and changes in groundwater flow to the sea. Two-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport simulations indicate that the response of recharge-limited systems is largely minimal, whereas topography-limited systems are vulnerable for various combinations of permeability, vertical anisotropy in permeability, and recharge. World coastlines were classified according to system type as a vulnerability indicator. Results indicate that approximately 70% of world coastlines may be topography-limited, though variability in hydrogeologic conditions strongly affects classification. Future recharge and sea-level rise scenarios have much less influence on the proportion of vulnerable coastlines than differences in permeability, distance to a hydraulic divide, and recharge, indicating that hydrogeologic properties and setting are more important factors to consider in determining system type than uncertainties in the magnitude of sea-level rise and hydrologic shifts associated with future climate change.

AB  - A semi-quantitative heuristic methodology is developed to map a rockfall detachment susceptibility zonation of El Hierro Island (Canary Archipelago). The rationalized procedure, which we called non-weighted bounded indicators, is based on overlapping thematic maps of conditioning factors to mass movement, which are appropriately and individually rescaled and then composed by addition to obtain a susceptibility numerical index through a GIS. As the consistency of the geomorphological analysis depends on the expert subjective criteria and the appropriate interpretation of the landscape, the use of this methodology reduces subjectivity and quantifies the degree of susceptibility. The main factors affecting the mass movement phenomena (rockfalls events), also recognized in the field and, therefore, considered in the presented GIS arrangement, are slope, profile curvature, lithology, vegetation cover and dykes density. To calculate the slope threshold or minimum angle characteristic of rockfall source areas, mixed Gaussian slope frequency decomposition is used. The curvature index reveals stepwise areas. Qualitative geomechanical characteristics are linked to a quantitative index according to a volcanic lithological-complexes classification. Both destabilization (root-wedging) and stabilization effects are considered into the vegetation cover index. The dyke density index incorporates the bearing rock capacity decrease produced in the halo around a dyke network intrusion. Slope, curvature and vegetation indexes thresholds have been fitted following field observations. A rockfall detachment susceptibility map is obtained and classified based on the histogram maxima. The rockfall inventory, based on rockfall events reported within the island, was used for the model validation. A 12 % of the whole island shows medium to very high susceptibility.

AB  - One source of potential harm from the cultivation of transgenic crops is their dispersal, persistence and spread in non-agricultural land. Ecological damage may result from such spread if the abundance of valued species is reduced. The ability of a plant to spread in non-agricultural habitats is called its invasiveness potential. The risks posed by the invasiveness potential of transgenic crops are assessed by comparing in agronomic field trials the phenotypes of the crops with the phenotypes of genetically similar non-transgenic crops known to have low invasiveness potential. If the transgenic and non-transgenic crops are similar in traits believed to control invasiveness potential, it may be concluded that the transgenic crop has low invasiveness potential and poses negligible ecological risk via persistence and spread in non-agricultural habitats. If the phenotype of the transgenic crop is outside the range of the non-transgenic comparators for the traits controlling invasiveness potential, or if the comparative approach is regarded as inadequate for reasons of risk perception or risk communication, experiments that simulate the dispersal of the crop into non-agricultural habitats may be necessary. We describe such an experiment for several commercial insect-resistant transgenic maize events in conditions similar to those found in maize-growing regions of Mexico. As expected from comparative risk assessments, the transgenic maize was found to behave similarly to non-transgenic maize and to be non-invasive. The value of this experiment in assessing and communicating the negligible ecological risk posed by the low invasiveness potential of insect-resistant transgenic maize in Mexico is discussed.

AB  - We describe the progression of Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) infection from birth until the first lactation in 61 animals from a typical large dairy herd of Argentina, with more than 85% of prevalence. The purpose was to identify potential points to effectively break the BLV cycle of transmission in our dairy productive system. We detected early infection in 11.47% of newborn calves by nested PCR. From birth to 12 months, no evidence of new infections was observed. After 12 months of age, the detection of new reactors increased slowly with time, from 15.09% at 15 months to 24% at 27 months. After that, the number of reactors increased rapidly up to 40% and 60.76% at 30 and 36 months, respectively. This last 9-month period coincided with parturition and the entry into the milking herd. Real-time PCR showed that more than 75% of adult animals had low peripheral-blood proviral load. Complementary, all infected animals showed low levels of provirus in milk and colostrum. The most important finding was that even when management procedures to prevent BLV iatrogenic transmission were followed, no significant change was observed in the prevalence after three years, strongly suggesting that other way/s of transmission play a key role under natural conditions. This study showed an interesting baseline to draw an alternative approach based on selective segregation according to the peripheral-blood proviral load as a potential indicator of risk transmission, and as an alternative to classical control measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies of hybrid fitness, of which agronomic performance may be an indicator, can help in evaluating the potential for introgression of a transgene from a transgenic crop to wild relatives. The objective of this study was to assess the agronomic performance of reciprocal hybrids between two transgenic glufosinate-resistant rice lines, Y0003 and 99-t, and two weedy rice accessions, WR1 and WR2, in the greenhouse.
   RESULTS: F-1 hybrids displayed heterosis in height, flag leaf area and number of spikelets per panicle. The agronomic performance of F1 between WR1 and Y0003 was not affected by crossing direction. The tiller and panicle numbers of F1 individuals were higher than their F2 counterparts. However, these traits did not change significantly from the F2 to the F3 generation or in hybrids with weedy rice as maternal or paternal plants. For all hybrids, the in vitro germination rates of fresh pollen were similar and significantly lower than those of their parents, seed sets were similar to or of lower value than those of weedy rice parents and seed shattering characteristics were partially suppressed, but the survival of hybrids over winter in the field was similar to that of weedy rice parents. All F1, F2 and F3 hybrids had similar composite agronomic performance to weedy rice parents.
   CONCLUSION: There was no significant decrease in the composite agronomic performance of any of the hybrids compared with weedy rice. This implies that gene flow from transgenic cultivated rice to weedy rice could occur under natural conditions. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - It has been suggested that condition-dependent signals may be a useful measure of environmental quality. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that oil pollution enhances oxidative stress and impairs expression of a carotenoid-based signal in a wild population of the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). During the courtship period, a group of gulls were fed a supplementary diet containing heavy fuel oil from the Prestige oil spill and were compared with control gulls fed a similar supplementary diet without fuel oil. Blood levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the most toxic components of crude oils, were higher (30%) in the Prestige oil-fed gulls than in the control gulls. Plasma concentrations of vitamin E and carotenoids were also significantly higher in the Prestige oil-fed gulls (31 and 27%, respectively). Although, the plasma levels of lipid peroxidation markers were higher (13%) in gulls fed with Prestige oil than in the control gulls, these differences were not significant, possibly because of the small number of gulls analyzed. The red bill spot was significantly smaller (16%) in the oil-fed gulls than in the control individuals. This study provides the first experimental evidence that a carotenoid-based signal in a free-living seabird is affected by exposure to oil pollution and is hence indicative of environmental quality. Since the yellow-legged gull belongs to a complex of species widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere, the method described may constitute a useful tool for evaluating sub-lethal effects of oil spills in seabirds.

AB  - Objective: To examine prospectively whether early parental child-rearing behavior is a predictor of cardiometabolic outcome in young adulthood when other potential risk factors are controlled. Metabolic factors associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease have been found to vary, depending on lifestyle as well as genetic predisposition. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that environmental conditions, such as stress in pre- and postnatal life, may have a sustained impact on an individual's metabolic risk profile. Methods: Participants were drawn from a prospective, epidemiological, cohort study followed up from birth into young adulthood. Parent interviews and behavioral observations at the age of 3 months were conducted to assess child-rearing practices and mother-infant interaction in the home setting and in the laboratory. In 279 participants, anthropometric characteristics, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins, and triglycerides were recorded at age 19 years. In addition, structured interviews were administered to the young adults to assess indicators of current lifestyle and education. Results: Adverse early-life interaction experiences were significantly associated with lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 in young adulthood. Current lifestyle variables and level of education did not account for this effect, although habitual smoking and alcohol consumption also contributed significantly to cardiometabolic outcomes. Conclusions: These findings suggest that early parental child-rearing behavior may predict health outcome in later life through its impact on metabolic parameters in adulthood.

AB  - Amphibians may be useful indicators of biological condition in small streams so determining which sampling technique maximizes encounters at the least cost and at the optimal time of year is important. Area constrained surveys (ACS), used by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey, were tested against cover board surveys, drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps, quadrat leaf litter searches, and leaf litter bags. Sixteen, 100 m-long sites were established in headwater streams in the Savage River State Forest in Garrett County, Maryland. Each technique was randomly assigned to a 25 m stream section within each overall sampling site, and sites were sampled once each month from May to October (2005) with additional sampling in March and April (2006). Area constrained surveys yielded means of 2.7 taxa and 14.9 total individuals per sampling visit, which was significantly higher than the yield of all other methods in all months except October and March, when yields were low for all techniques. Area constrained surveys were also significantly more cost-effective per taxon and per individual compared to all other methods. September produced the most taxa and individuals, October and March produced the least, and yields for April through August were similar to September. We employed removal sampling at four sites in April 2006, but abundance could not be estimated because a significant linear decrease in the accumulated catch versus catch per unit effort did not occur for three of the sites.

AB  - The aquatic macrophyte Salvinia auriculata has been used in several monitoring programs in bodies of water susceptible of eutrophication, being thus considered a bioindicator. However, salvinia is also known to have phytoremediating potential, accumulating considerable concentrations of pollutants in its tissues. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the potential of this plant as a phytoremediator and bioindicator by analyzing its morphologic characteristics when submitted to Zinc (Zn) overdoses, as well as to determine the level of this metal accumulated in its tissues. The individuals were collected in water bodies free from contamination and cultivated in vases, using a nutrition solution, under controlled greenhouse conditions and submitted to treatments with Zinc in the form of ZnSO4, 7H(2)O at the following concentrations: 0; 2.5; 5.0; 7.5 and 10.0 mg L-1. The morphologic alterations were observed daily and after ten days of exposure of the plants to Zinc, the number of individuals per treatment was counted. The plants were then harvested, washed, dried, weighed, ground and digested in a nitric and perchloric acid solution, with extracts being obtained for determination of the Zinc levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results indicated that S. auriculata presented morphologic damage, with the development of lesions and marginal necrosis on the leaves with Zinc concentrations, in solution, being superior to that allowed by the legislation, but not different in relation to the population growth. Zinc absorption by the S.auriculata plants increased proportionally to the concentration of the metal in the solution. When at high concentrations. Zinc became toxic to the plants, with their morphologic alterations being easy to detect. allowing them to be used in monitoring Zinc-polluted aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Unsustainable management of the "Espinal" agroecosystem of central Chile has progressively lowered the organic matter content and fertility of soil as evidenced by decreasing forage production and lower coverage of espino (Acacia caven (Mol.) Mol.), a leguminous tree. This savannah-type ecosystem includes the soil Cauquenes clay loam (Ultic Palexeralfs; Umbric Acrisols) that formed in granitic residuum, and a Mediterranean-type climate having extended dry periods during the warmer months (November through March). Considering that productivity is related to soil organic matter, the objectives of this investigation were to determine the content of organic carbon (C) in soil of well preserved, typical and degraded Espinals; evaluate fractions of the soil organic matter as indicators of sustainable management; and use the Century model to determine the potential gains of C in the soils. Well-preserved, typical, and degraded Espinal sites were located near Cauquenes, Chile, and soil samples were collected in three representative subsites at 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm depths. In the laboratory, organic matter was fractionated using distilled water to isolate the light fraction, and C content was measured using dry combustion of the separate fractions. Century was calibrated to local conditions and simulations were run using current and less intensive management. The results indicated that total soil C of typical and degraded Espinals was 18 and 49% lower, respectively, than in soil of the well-preserved Espinal, and that the ratio of C in the light fraction between the two soil depths may be a useful indicator of sustainable management. Model simulations forecasted that soil C would slowly increase in the degraded Espinal by 3.19-3.86 Mg ha(-1), after 100 years.

AB  - Finding the ideal deep-sea CaCO3 dissolution proxy is essential for quantifying the role of the marine carbonate system in regulating atmospheric pCO(2) over millennia. We explore the potential of using the Globorotalia menardii fragmentation index ( MFI) and size-normalized foraminifer shell weight (SNSW) as complementary indicators of deep-sea CaCO3 dissolution. MFI has strong correlations with bottom water [CO32-], modeled estimates of percent CaCO3 dissolved, and Mg/Ca in Pulleniatina obliquiloculata in core top samples along a depth transect on the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) where surface ocean temperature variation is minimal. SNSW of P. obliquiloculata and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei have weak correlations with MFI-based percent dissolved, Mg/Ca in P. obliquiloculata shells and bottom water [CO32-] on the OJP. In core top samples from the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP), SNSW of P. obliquiloculata has moderate to strong correlations with both MFI-based percent CaCO3 dissolved estimates and surface ocean environmental parameters. SNSW of N. dutertrei shells shows a latitudinal distribution in the EEP and a moderately strong correlation with MFI-based percent dissolved estimates when samples from the equatorial part of the region are excluded. Our results suggest that there may potentially be multiple genotypes of N. dutertrei in the EEP which may be reflected in their shell weight. MFI-based percent CaCO3 dissolved estimates have no quantifiable relationship with any surface ocean environmental parameter in the EEP. Thus MFI acts as a reliable quantitative CaCO3 dissolution proxy insensitive to environmental biases within calcification waters of foraminifers.

AB  - Bivalves and especially mussels are very good indicators of marine and estuarine pollution, and so they have been widely used in biomonitoring programs all around the world. However, traditional single parameter biomarkers face the problem of high sensitivity to biotic and abiotic factors. In our study, digestive gland peroxisome-enriched fractions of Mytilus edulis (L., 1758) were analyzed by DIGE and MS. We identified several proteomic signatures associated with the exposure to several marine pollutants (diallyl phthalate, PBDE-47, and bisphenol-A). Animals collected from North Atlantic Sea were exposed to the contaminants independently under controlled laboratory conditions. One hundred and eleven spots showed a significant increase or decrease in protein abundance in the two-dimensional electrophoresis maps from the groups exposed to pollutants. We obtained a unique protein expression signature of exposure to each of those chemical compounds. Moreover a set of proteins composed a proteomic signature in common to the three independent exposures. It is remarkable that the principal component analysis of these spots showed a discernible separation between groups, and so did the hierarchical clustering into four classes. The 14 proteins identified by MS participate in alpha- and beta-oxidation pathways, xenobiotic and amino acid metabolism, cell signaling, oxyradical metabolism, peroxisomal assembly, respiration, and the cytoskeleton. Our results suggest that proteomic signatures could become a valuable tool to monitor the presence of pollutants in field experiments where a mixture of pollutants is often present. Further studies on the identified proteins could provide crucial information to understand possible mechanisms of toxicity of single xenobiotics or mixtures of them in marine ecosystems.

AB  - The low-frequency variability of heavy precipitation and drought conditions is investigated for 104 rain-gauge stations in Switzerland covering the 20th century. This constitutes an exceptionally dense data set of centennial time series. The investigation is based on a wide range of daily and multi-day precipitation statistics encompassing basic characteristics, measures of heavy precipitation and indices of typical and extreme dry and wet spells. Two different methods of trend analysis and statistical testing are applied, depending on the data nature of the statistic. Linear regression is used for statistics with a continuous value range, and logistic regression is used for statistics with a discrete value range. The trends are calculated on a seasonal basis for the years 1901-2000.
   A clear trend signal is found for winter and autumn, with a high number of sites with a statistically significant trend. In winter, significant increases are found for all statistics related to precipitation strength and occurrence. The centennial increase is between 10 and 30% for the high quantiles and the seasonal 1 day to 10 day extremes. In autumn, statistically significant increases are found only for the statistics related to heavy precipitation, whereas precipitation frequency and spell-length statistics show little systematic change. Although the winter trend signal is strongest in northern and western Switzerland, the autumn trend signal is more uniform. In spring and summer, the heavy precipitation and the spell-duration statistics did not show statistically significant trends. Sensitivity tests indicate that the winter and autumn trends are robust with respect to inhomogeneities in the rain-gauge time series. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB  - To understand the importance of plasticity of central processing organs (i.e., stomach and intestinal organs) to animals in the wild, field studies of changes in organs and their relationships with variable environmental conditions and energy demands are needed. We determined relationships among diet quality, indicators of energy demand, sizes of central processing organs, and rate of nutrient uptake in free-living white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in western Kentucky. Moderate winters and dry summers characterized the study site. In contrast to studies conducted in more extreme environments, we found limited differences in the sizes and function of central processing organs among seasons. Masses, but not lengths of intestinal organs or the rate of glucose uptake, differed among seasons. Heart and spleen masses, but not masses of the lungs, kidneys, or liver, also differed among seasons. Differences in the amount of food ingested and percentage of protein in the diet were likely contributors to seasonal differences in intestinal organ masses. Lactation was associated with heavier masses of all central processing organs and increased rate of glucose uptake, but not with heavier masses of vital organs. Greater size and function of intestinal organs during lactation was attributed primarily to high energy demand and secondarily to diet. We postulated that large changes in size and function of central processing organs in free-living mammals occur during intense, but not moderate, changes in energy demand and diet composition and are dependent on the type of energy demand incurred.

AB  - Indicator or "good genes" models of sexual selection predict that mating preferences allow females to choose mates that are genetically superior. Female gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor) prefer male advertisement calls of long calf duration, which can be indicators of enhanced offspring growth performance. We tested the effects of father's call duration and the presence of a caged predator (dragonfly naiad) on tadpole activity and growth in a factorial experiment, controlling for maternal and environmental effects. The effect of food availability (a repeated measure) on tadpole activity was also examined. Tadpoles responded to predator presence and to high food availability by decreasing activity and feeding. Tadpoles exposed to a caged predator were smaller after 14 days than those exposed to an empty cage, suggesting that spending less time feeding carries the cost of reduced growth. Offspring of males with long versus short calls responded similarly to the presence of a predator. Nonetheless, offspring of long-calling males spent more time feeding than did offspring of short-calling males, except when a predator was present but no food was available. Increased time spent feeding may contribute to enhanced offspring growth and, therefore, to the indirect benefit that a female may realize by selecting a mate with long calls. However, because the behavioral differences depended on the environment, and because the fitness consequences of such behavioral differences should also vary with the environment, the benefit of mating with a long-calling male may depend on the conditions encountered by the offspring.

AB  - Carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) modified with different soils in their native form were prepared to create a soil-like solid phase suitable fur application in studies of heavy metal ion uptake and binding interactions. The preparation of CPEs modified with five different soils was examined and their heavy metal ion uptake behavior investigated using a model Cu(II) aqueous solution. Metal ions were accumulated under open circuit conditions and were determined after a medium exchange using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry, applying pre-electrolysis at -0.7 V. The soil-modified CPE accumulation behavior, including the linearity of the current response versus Cu(II) concentration, the influence of the pH on the solution, and the uptake kinetics, was thoroughly investigated. The correlation between the soil-modified CPE uptake capability and the standard soil parameters, such as ion exchange capacity, soil pH, organic matter and clay content, were evaluated for all five examined soils. The influence of selected endogenous cations (K(I), Ca(II), Fe(III)) on the transfer of Cu(II) ions from a solution to the simulated soil solid phase was examined and is discussed. Preliminary examinations of the soil-modified CPE uptake behavior with some exogenous heavy metal ions of strong environmental interest (Pb(II), Ng(II), Cd(II) and Ag(I)) are also presented. This work demonstrates some attractive possibilities fur the application of a soil-modified CPE in studying soil-heavy metal ion binding interactions, with a further potential use as a new environmental sensor appropriate fur fast on-site testing of polluted soils.

AB  - Indicator species are species which can be monitored as an index to measure the overall health of an ecosystem. Crocodylians have been shown to be good indicators of wetland condition as they respond to changes in hydrology, can be efficiently monitored, and are a key part of ecosystem trophic relationships. Eye shine surveys at night are a standard method used to sample alligators, but because some individuals that are present in a study area may go undetected and the proportion of individuals counted is not constant over time, appropriate modeling is required to convert counts to estimates of abundance. We analyzed 13 years of American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) survey count data from South Florida using an N-mixture model. Alligator abundance estimates were assigned to quartiles that were then represented as color coded categories of red, yellow, or green to provide a straightforward rating of Everglades restoration based on familiar stoplight coloring. These results were then compared to a previously used method in which unadjusted counts of these same data were assigned to color coded quartile categories. Water depth played a major role in the detection probability of alligators and the stoplight colors between the two methods matched 76% of the time. This suggests that the original stoplight score method provided a good overall snapshot of the trends in alligator abundance in the Everglades; however, the hierarchical models estimate abundance and trends of alligator abundance by incorporating detection probability thus providing unbiased estimates of abundance.

AB  - Increased conventional tillage intensity causes soil degradation in agrosystems. In this field experiment, we evaluate the sensitivity of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties under varying soil tillage intensities. The treatments were: TI0 (tillage intensity zero); TI2 (tillage intensity two); TI4 (tillage intensity four); TI6 (tillage intensity six); and TI8 (tillage intensity eight). These treatments corresponded to two tillage seasons (dry and rainy conditions) with four tillage intensities of conventional tillage (ploughing + harrowing) performed monthly. The restorative role of crop growth and rotations in soil properties was not considered in this study, and the interval between soil tillage was short. After the second tillage season, we determined 31 soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Biological properties were more affected by conventional tillage intensity than physical and chemical properties. The most sensitive soil properties to the increasing tillage intensities were aggregate weighted mean diameter (WMD), percentage of aggregates (PA), bulk density (Bd), total porosity (TP), macroporosity (Mac), microporosity (Mic), soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic matter (SOM), total microbial activity (FDA), arylsulfatase (Ary), acid phosphatase (Phos), and xylanase activity (Xyl). A minimum data set including WMD, Mac, SOM, and Xyl was suggested. The highest intensity of conventional tillage reduced WMD, Xyl and Mac by 28%, 51%, and 63%, respectively, and increased SOM by 14% relative to the control. This work may guide managers on the best soil properties for monitoring the impacts of soil tillage on soil quality in agricultural areas that routinely use conventional tillage as a management practice.

AB  - The social function of business is most effectively implemented through the mechanism and tools of the concept of corporate social responsibility (high quality standards, responsible manufacturing, employee care, social and progress reporting, law-abiding cooperation with the state, transparent business, refusal to produce harmful to health products, etc.). The purpose of the paper is a comprehensive analysis of theoretical-methodological principles of corporate social responsibility, the dominants of its formation and implementation in modern world models, as well as substantiation of strategic priorities of Ukrainian socially oriented model of corporate social responsibility in the national economy. The fundamental methodological basis of the study is a set of methods of scientific cognition, the principles of dialectical, structural-functional and empirical approaches. It is argued that the Ukrainian model of corporate social responsibility is in its infancy. The specifics of the Ukrainian model of corporate social responsibility include the lack of basic principles of responsible behavior of enterprises throughout the country, weak motivation for such practices, lack of state support for the formation of the institutional environment of corporate social responsibility, significant corruption barriers. It will be effective to implement the model of corporate social responsibility within a socially oriented model, in which public institutions and the state play a key role, under conditions of minimizing the level of corruption and strict adherence to socially oriented strategic priorities of the country development on the basis of systematic monitoring, analysis and practical measures for qualitative improvement of macroeconomic indicators of the economy. Priority areas for effective formation of the national model of social responsibility of Ukrainian business have been identified.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to empirically test the proposition that contagion of emotions triggers moral disengagement and subsequent increases in work-related injuries. Using emotional contagion and social cognitive theories, we tested the proposition that higher contagion of anger (i.e., a negative emotion that interferes with mental functioning and enables inappropriate behavior) would trigger moral justifications for safety violations, whereas higher contagion of joy (i.e., a positive emotion accompanied by an optimal operating condition and constructive activity) would prevent safety-related moral disengagement. In turn, moral disengagement was predicted to be related to higher rates of subsequent workplace injuries. Using a cross-country and multi-method (i.e., cross-lagged, cross-sectional) design, data from 503 employees in the U.S. (two-wave) and 538 employees in Italy (cross-sectional) supported the hypothesized mediation model. Specifically, both in the U.S. and Italy, emotional contagion of anger positively predicted moral disengagement, whereas emotional contagion of joy negatively predicted moral disengagement. Furthermore, moral disengagement positively predicted experienced injuries and partially mediated the relationship between contagion of joy/anger and injuries. These findings suggest that moral justifications of safety violations, and related injuries, may be prevented by exchanges of positive emotions (and triggered by exchanges of negative emotions) that employees absorb during social interactions at work. Theoretical and practical implications for organizational ethics are discussed in light of the globally increasing emotional pressure and concerns for a safe and psychologically healthy environment in today's workplace, particularly given the recent pandemic spread of Coronavirus disease (CoVid-19).

AB  - The design of sustainable energy systems requires to enlarge the analysis beyond the traditional boundaries for including the economic, environmental, and societal needs and constraints in the decision-making process. In this regard, this work investigates the conceptual design of distributed energy systems by means of a multi-objective optimization strategy to simultaneously address the economic, environmental, and social aspects in the energy system design. Initially, the water consumption and the inherent safety indicators were introduced and evaluated through two single-objective optimization problems to enhance the analysis of the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. Then, a framework including the total annualized cost, CO2 emissions, water consumption, grid dependence, and inherent safety index was used to perform the multi-objective analysis. To carry out a thorough and comprehensive analysis, four optimization problems including different combinations of the sustainability indicators were proposed and solved. The compromise among the objective functions was identified, and the obtained Pareto sets were explored for elucidating the changes in the design and operating conditions across the non-dominated solutions. According to results, the cost of energy can range between 0.37 and 0.63 ?/kWh, the CO2 emissions can vary between 10.6 and 68.5 kgCO2/MWh, and the water consumption can be between 27.8 and 70.2 m3H2O/GWh depending on the evaluated objective. Moreover, it was determined that the safety of the energy system can be improved by increasing the use of the water electrolysis pathway to produce hydrogen and by reducing the capacity of the hydrogen storage unit.

AB  - Telomere shortening has been used as an indicator of aging and is believed to accelerate under harsh environmental conditions. This can be attributed to the fact that telomere shortening has often been regarded as non-reversible and negatively impacting fitness. However, studies of laboratory mice indicate that they may be able to repair telomere loss to recover from environmental harshness, as indicated by recent studies in hibernating rodents. We studied seasonal variation in telomere dynamics in African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) living in a highly seasonal environment. In our annual species, individuals born in the moist spring (high food availability) need to survive the harsh dry summer (low food availability) to be able to reproduce in the following spring. We studied the effect of the harsh dry vs. the benign moist season on telomere dynamics. We also tested if telomere length or the rate of change in telomere length over the dry season predicted the probablity of dissapearance from the population at the same time. Male, but not female, stripped mice showed age-related telomere erosion. Telomeres were longer at the beginning of the dry season compared to the rest of the year. Telomeres increased significantly in length during the moist season. Neither telomere length at the onset of the dry season nor telomere loss over the dry season predicted whether or not individuals disappeared. In conclusion, our data suggest that seasonal attrition and restoring of telomeres also occurs in non-hibernating wild rodents living in hot food restricted environments.

AB  - This study aims to examine the translocation of heavy metals from urban soils to herbs in Tyumen (Russian Federation). The mobile and acid-soluble heavy metal fractions in soils, as well as the heavy metal contents in plants, were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The bioconcentration factor was estimated as the ratio of the amount of heavy metals in soils to that in plants. Heavy metal concentrations in urban soils were higher than those at the control site by 20% and by up to 10 times. The greatest heavy metal accumulation in both soils and plants was found at the battery manufacturing and metallurgical plants, exceeding the control levels of Pb and Fe by 2-17 times. The Cu, Fe and Mn contents in soil were positively correlated with those in plants. Heavy metal translocation by the plants was species-specific. The percentages of the mobile heavy metal fractions decreased in the following order: Mn > Zn > Cu > Fe. Heavy metal accumulation inPoa pratensis,Trifolium rubens,Vicia cracca,Matricaria chamomillaandTussilago farfarain the urban sites compared to that at the control site decreased in the following order: Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > Pb > Cd.Tussilago farfaraexhibited the highest Fe, Mn and Zn accumulation, which exceeded the control levels by 17, 5 and 3.5 times, respectively. The heavy metal bioconcentration factors, indicators of translocation, decreased in the following order: Cu > Zn > Cd > Pb > Mn > Fe. The heavy metal translocation suggests the need to relocate industrial facilities to areas outside the city. Future monitoring of the study area is needed to ensure its long-term ecological safety.

AB  - The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is one of the well-established drought metrics worldwide. It is simply computed using precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) data. Although AED is considered a key driver of drought variability worldwide, it could have less impact on drought in specific regions and for particular times as a function of the magnitude of precipitation. Specifically, the influence of the AED might overestimate drought severity during both normal and humid periods, resulting in "false alarms" about drought impacts on physical and human environments. Here, we provided a global characterization of the sensitivity of the SPEI to changes of the AED. Results demonstrate that the contribution of AED to drought severity is largely impacted by the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation. Specifically, the impact of AED on drought severity was more pronounced during periods of low precipitation, compared to wet periods. Interestingly, drought severity in humid regions (as revealed by SPEI) also showed low sensitivity to AED under drier conditions. These results highlight the skill of SPEI in identifying the role of AED in drought evolution, especially in arid and semiarid regions whose climate is characterized typically by low precipitation. This advantage was also evident for humid environments, where SPEI did not overestimate drought severity due to the increased AED. These findings highlight the broader applicability of SPEI to accurately characterize drought severity worldwide.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO) air pollution in urban areas, mainly associated with inha- lation of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter emitted from motor vehicles, is responsible for one million deaths per year. Carbon monoxide (CO) from the incomplete combustion of fuel is known to bind with hemo- globin, decreasing the blood oxygen -delivery and inducing tissues hypoxia; being more pronounced under con- ditions of stress like physical activity. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of a compact CO sensor (Alphasense CO -B4) mounted on a bicycle to evaluate atmospheric levels of CO associated with urban micro - environments within a growing Australian city (Brisbane). Urban bike pathways show pronounced and signi ficant variations in air quality according to the surrounding microenvironment and the time of day. The inhaled dose in real time and the CO total dose over each trip were valuable for estimating the air quality of the route, and identifed how the health bene fits of riding a bicycle could be partially offset by poor air quality depending on where and when a cycle route is taken in the inner-city. Finally, environmental conditions, such as wind speed, were found to signi ficantly affected atmospheric CO concentrations, at least during the study period. The present work provides information regarding commuters' exposure to atmospheric pollutants, necessary for modifying the population's (including cyclists) perception of pollution in the urban environment, providing people with the opportunity to choose a healthier route.

AB  - The abundance and variation in population and species composition of benthic organisms reflects environmental conditions, which can be used in long term monitoring and management of mangrove forests. This study assessed the three mangrove forest systems Sandspit back waters (SBS), Korangi-Phitti creek (KPM) and Sonmiani Bay (NB) based on the associated benthic community with respect to environmental variations. The samples for macrobenthos and sediment and pore water analyses were collected from 96 cores at three stations in each forest stand. The average values for nutrients in pore water were apparently higher at NB and lower at SBS. A total of 48 macrobenthos species were recorded from the three stands. Species diversity and density was higher at SBS and lower at NB. Crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs were the most abundant and diverse groups. In this study, the benthic fauna was distinct between the three mangrove systems and the species composition and abundance reflects the responses to variations in environmental parameters. The distribution of polychaete families such as Capitellidae, Spionidae and Cirratullidae reflects that KPM is the most polluted with respect to organic pollution and NB is the least polluted mangrove area. SBS, located near Layari River, appears to be more eutrophic due to higher nutrient loadings. Dry sediments, nutrient loadings, and concentration of Cu and Mn appeared to regulate the forest community structure and negatively correlate with the diversity and density of macrobenthos. The information and suggestions given in this study can be used in the effective management of mangroves forests areas in future.

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is one of the areas in the world most affected by marine litter. The main aim of this paper is to reflect on the key outcomes of the special session entitled 'Harmful effects of plastic litter and mitigation strategies in the Mediterranean Sea', which was organized within the framework of the SETAC Europe 28th Annual Meeting. The event highlighted the harmful effects of plastic pollution in the Mediterranean and brought forward multi-stakeholder and multi-level efforts to tackle it effectively. This commentary provides an overview of: a) the harmful effects of plastic litter on Mediterranean biodiversity and a three-fold assessment approach to detect impacts with the use of bioindicator species; b) the monitoring and mitigation strategies implemented within the frameworks of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Barcelona Convention Regional Plan for Marine Litter Management in the Mediterranean; c) the essential role of NGOs in strengthening the science-policy-society interface to address marine litter and in making effective connections between scientific knowledge and societal actions; d) the role of industry in addressing marine litter with a special focus on the potential application of biodegradable plastics in the aquaculture and the fisheries sector, and e) the barriers but also the enabling conditions needed to address the issue effectively. This paper also underlines one of the main challenges of our era: the gap between science, policy and society and how this could be closed towards achieving effective decision-making and comprehensive actions against marine litter.

AB  - The transgenerational reproductive and developmental toxicity of tebuconazole (TEB) in Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated over five generations (P0 - F4). Only parental C.elegans (P0) were exposed to TEB (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mu g/L) for 24 h and the subsequent offspring (F1-F4) were grown under TEB-free conditions. TEB exposure caused dose-dependent reproductive defects and developmental impairments in C.elegans. In the P0 generation reproductive defects were observed such as: reduced brood size and embryo hatchability, prolonged generation time, retarded gonadal development, and slower germline proliferation, even at 0.01 mu g/L, together with developmental toxicity with significant reduced body length and narrowed body width at 10 mu g/L. Additionally, the brood size significantly reduced in F2, which began to recover from F3, but was still lower than the control in F4. The proportion of abnormalities increased significantly in F2 and reduced from F3, but was still higher than the control, suggesting that TEB could have cumulative potential and be passed to offspring through parental exposure. Furthermore, exposure to TEB (10 mu g/L) in P0 significantly reduced the body length in F1, which began to recover from F2, and was the same level as the control in F4. There was a concentration-dependent increase in body width in F1-F4, with a significant increase only observed in F1 at 10 mu g/L. Thus, parental exposure to TEB induced transgenerational defects in both reproduction and development, emphasizing the significance of considering bio-toxicity over multiple generations to conduct accurate assessment of environmental risks of toxicants.

AB  - In this paper, taking the Longmaxi Formation shale of the YS118 well in the northern part of Yunnan-Guizhou, China as an example, the controlling factors of organic carbon accumulation in black shale were analyzed using organic carbon, trace elements, rare earth element test data and statistical results on the abundance of the graptolite. The results showed that the TOC content in the lower part of the Longmaxi Formation increased with the increase of depth, and the abundance of the graptolite controlled the degree of organic carbon accumulation. The correlation coefficient between the abundance of the graptolite and the Ba element is about 0.4. In addition to the graptolite, the algae also controls the size of the ancient productivity. The anoxic deposition environment indicated by the redox index such as V/(V+Ni), V/Cr, Ni/Co and U/Th is more conducive to the accumulation of organic carbon, followed by the oxygen-depleted deposition environment. For the deposition rate characterized by (La/Yb) N value, as the TOC increases, the deposition rate is lower, and the lower deposition rate is favorable for the aggregation of organic carbon. The Late Ordovician-Early Silurian series of tectonic movements, on the one hand, formed a deep water sedimentary environment in the study area and provided a good place for the development of the Longmaxi Formation shale. On the other hand, it also promotes changes in paleoproductivity and redox conditions, forming a sedimentary environment conducive to the accumulation of organic carbon.

AB  - There is an important individual variability in development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and this feature needs to be better addressed in preclinical studies. Previously we showed that only rats that explored the context before a foot shock (delayed shock group) exhibited long-lasting behavioral changes. In this study the delayed shock group was segregated using the freezing response upon re-exposure to the shock-paired context and we investigated whether higher reactivity would be related to behavioral alterations and to activation of brain regions using Fos immunoreactivity. The latter allowed the analysis of co-activity patterns among brain regions within each group, by creating connectivity maps. High responder rats (HR) displayed heightened freezing response upon context re-exposure, anxiety-like behavior, impaired exploratory behavior and fear sensitization. Fos analysis showed that HR displayed a negative correlation between the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) after the first context re-exposure. After the second context re-exposure, HR displayed reduced Fos expression in vHPC CA1 area, whereas low responders (LR) showed increased Fos in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. Pearson correlation analyses revealed positive associations between freezing and Fos in the dorsal the periaqueductal gray and vHPC after exposure to unfamiliar acoustic stimulus in a novel environment. Thus, assessment of individual variability allowed the identification of a subset of reactive animals that displayed behavioral modifications relevant to PTSD. Fos correlation and network analyses revealed co-activity patterns in HR rats that may point out to associations of brain areas relevant to the behavioral outcomes.

AB  - In the present-day economic science, the problems of public management efficiency are traditionally disputable for a number of reasons. First, this investigatory field is closely related to the national peculiarities of public management system development which produced numerous scientific disputes about advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Second, despite the fact that the state sector reformation and the problems of economic efficacy in particular have become the subject of quite many works, these two trends were developing separately, and there are rather few works of interdisciplinary nature.
   In this article the authors, based on the conducted content-analysis, systemize the main approaches to assessment of public management efficiency from the perspective of the development of scientific concepts about the role and significance of the state within the economic theory. Under the conditions of development of Project Cycle Management paradigm the authors single out the new stage - the contemporary fourth "assessment wave". The article suggests a new method of assessment of public administration efficiency based on the principles of meta-assessment at various stages of lifecycle of the state priorities implementation. The basic analytical tool of the method is GAP-analysis used by the authors for the search of possible emerging discrepancies between the increment rates of targeted indicators of the program financing and the increment rates of state financing of the program. Analytical opportunities of the model are illustrated based on the analysis of satisfaction with state (municipal) service quality.

AB  - We examined temporal changes in spatial patterns of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) in response to the restoration of geomorphic habitat in Navigation Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River from 1998 to 2016. The frequency of occurrence and species composition of SAV at sampling sites were spatially interpolated for each year to create annual maps. Linear models were fitted to temporal changes in SAV within each map pixel. The frequency of occurrence of SAV (across all species) increased over time in much of the impounded region of the pool, including areas near restored islands. However, impounded areas maintained a relatively consistent species composition over time, with species known to be tolerant of higher flow velocities (>0.10m/second) and wind fetch distances (>1,000m) (e.g. Vallisneria americana) being most abundant. In contrast, areas protected by newly constructed islands transitioned from V. americana to species found in other protected backwater habitats and known to be intolerant of high flow velocities and wind fetch distances (e.g. Ceratophyllum demersum). The results suggest that previously reported improvements in water clarity may have improved growing conditions for all SAV species, especially in the lower impounded portion of the pool, while island restoration created more backwater-like habitats and facilitated changes in species composition. Assessing changes in SAV occurrence alone offers only a partial view of local-scale river restoration (e.g. island building), while analyses of species composition are likely to be more indicative of the types of changes (i.e. reduced flow velocity and wind fetch) associated with restoring geomorphic habitat.

AB  - Benthic diatom communities are used widely as indicators of river health due to their rapid response to changes in water quality. The ability for diatom-based indices to detect eutrophication has been well documented; however, an index designed specifically to detect herbicide impacts is yet to be established. This is required as herbicide contamination of rivers is common in agricultural regions and poses a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems. This study developed a new biomonitoring index (SPEAR(herbicides)) using benthic diatom communities to detect the toxic impacts of herbicides in rivers, and tested it across 14 rivers in the Great Barrier Reef catchment area, Australia. The new index uses diatom species traits to classify diatoms as either sensitive or tolerant to herbicides and calculates the fraction of sensitive taxa within a sample. The SPEAR(herbicides) index showed a decline in herbicide sensitive diatoms with increasing herbicide toxicity of the sites. The impacts of herbicide toxicity on the diatom community were only apparent after the wet season when aqueous herbicide concentrations typically peak and diatoms were able to recover during the dry season when herbicide concentrations were lower. SPEAR(herbicides) values had a negative relationship with the percentage of grazing and cropping in catchments but had a positive relationship with the percentage of conservation in catchments. SPEAR(herbicides) also had a negative relationship with co-occurring potential stressors such as nutrients and total suspended solids.

AB  - As a result of the analysis of studies in the field of the creation and operation of underground gas storage facilities (PSG) in the conditions of heterogeneous reservoirs, the lack of a comprehensive method for incorporating the heterogeneity factor at the stage of their design is established. As a result, there is a significant overestimation of project indicators comparing to actual and a decrease in the efficiency of the operation of the subsystem.
   In this article, the author presents methodological developments for the account of the heterogeneity of the reservoir at the design stage of the UGS, which contains specific proposals for the refinement of initial stocks and gas-saturated reservoir volume by reinterpreting the dependence of reduced reservoir pressure on the total amount of gas in underground gas storage.
   The purpose of this work is to assess the impact of geological and industrial factors on the technological performance of the PSG, created in exhausted gas deposits, by comparing the characteristics of the work of Oparsky and Bogorodchansky UGS. To achieve this goal, the geological-industrial features of the Oparsky and Bogorodchansky UGS have been investigated; the methodology for studying geological heterogeneity has been developed; the influence of geological factors on the technological parameters of the operation of the UHF is investigated.
   The results of the study are of practical importance. The use of the methodology for studying the nature of the heterogeneity of reservoir layers is necessary in the design of new gas storage facilities and in the adjustment of technological projects on gas-fired power stations that are in operation and created in non-uniform collectors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess behavioural and glucocorticoid changes in black-and-white ruffed lemur females transported for breeding purposes between Czech ZOOs. The frequency of the presented behaviour elements was recorded via direct observation. The faecal samples were collected from the floor and subsequently the faecal glucocorticoid values were determined using specifically designed assays for faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) analysis. While the frequency of certain comfort behaviour patterns decreased (P < 0.05) in response to transport and change of the environment, grooming, resting, sleeping as well as playful behaviour (chasing, climbing) were not affected (P > 0.05). No changes were found in the frequency of behaviour connected to metabolic events with the exception of defecation. Lemur females defecated more frequently (P < 0.05) in their new environment. The frequency of neither fear nor exploratory behaviour differed (P > 0.05) before and after transport. The positive effect of the novelty was shown by the reduction (P < 0.01) of behavioural signs of frustration and stereotypical behaviour after transport. In response to transport, a significant (P < 0.05) increase of FGM levels was found the second day after the transport, reaching peak levels in the morning and starting to decline to baseline levels in the afternoon. The results of both behaviour and adrenocortical activity analysis suggest that despite some presented changes in the monitored indices prior and after transport, the transportation under the studied conditions presented only a mild stressor with limited behavioural and glucocorticoid responses.

AB  - Cell-free production of G-protein coupled receptors is becoming attractive for biochemical characterization, ligand screening or even structural purposes. However, despite high production levels within the range of mg/mL, the fraction of functionally folded receptor is frequently below 1%. In synthetic cell-free reactions, numerous factors that affect the efficient folding and stability of translated membrane proteins can be addressed by the appropriate design of the synthetic expression environment. We demonstrate the systematic quality optimization of the cell-free synthesized human endothelin B receptor by a combined approach of lipid screening, redox optimization, and molecular engineering. Key parameters for receptor folding are the implementation of nanodiscs, the selection of suitable lipid environments for co-translational solubilization, as well as providing an optimized redox system for essential disulfide bridge formation. In addition, enrichment with chaperones as well as receptor engineering by thermostabilization further supported the folding into ligand binding conformation. In summary, we provide evidence that the initial co-translational folding process rather than long-term stability of the receptor is limiting. The folding efficiency could be improved by more than 10(3)-fold and under optimized conditions, up to 1.6 nmol or similar to 100 mu g of ligand binding competent receptor could be produced per mL of reaction mixture in a timescale of less than 24 h. The identified parameters affect rather common characteristics of G-protein receptors and are thus likely to improve the folding of similar targets as well. The optimized process provides full-length receptors embedded in defined membrane environments and in quantities and quality sufficient for throughput screening applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study constructed a multidimensional indicator system to evaluate low carbon development of the whole country and 30 provinces in China from 2003 to 2013, based on the maximum flux principle, which reflects the dynamic evolutionary process of low carbon development. Then k-means cluster analysis was used to classify 30 provinces into three grades (highest, medium and lowest) according to their average low carbon development level. Finally, Moran's I was used to investigate the spatial correlation of low carbon development in China. The simulation results show that the national low carbon development level increased with fluctuations from 2008 as the nation paid high attention to low carbon development, and the provincial low carbon development is unbalanced, which is closely related to the socioeconomic conditions, resources endowment and geographical locations. For each province, the development level of different evaluative dimension grows unequally. For each grade, the provinces of highest grade have good performance in energy and environmental dimensions and the provinces of medium grade have good performance in society or the economic dimension, but the provinces of lowest grade have a lower development level in all dimensions. There is significant positive spatial dependence and cluster characteristics in low carbon development in China. In general, high-level provinces are distributed in southern China while low-level provinces are mainly located in northern China. The high-level provinces should perform their demonstrating functions and promote low carbon development in their surrounding areas.

AB  - Although hypoxic aquatic environments cause negative effects on shrimp, these animals can withstand somewhat hypoxia, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this capacity are still poorly understood. In humans, mild hypoxia causes the induction of many proteins to allow cell survival. In contrast, apoptosis is induced during severe hypoxia leading to cell death. p53 is a key transcription factor that determines cells fate towards cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis in humans. The aim of this work was to study the role of p53 in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in response to hypoxia in hepatopancreas of the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. p53 was silenced by RNAi and afterwards the shrimp were exposed to hypoxia. Cdk-2 was used as indicator of cell cycle progression while caspase-3 expression and caspase activity were analyzed as indicators of apoptosis. p53 levels in hepatopancreas were significantly higher at 48 h after hypoxic treatment. Increased expression levels of Cdk-2 were found in p53-silenced shrimp after 24 and 48 h in the normoxic treatments as well as 48 h after hypoxia, indicating a possible role of p53 in cell cycle regulation. In response to hypoxia, unsilenced shrimp showed an increase in caspase-3 expression levels, however an increase was also observed in caspase activity at 24 h of normoxic conditions in p53-silenced shrimps. Taken together these results indicate the involvement of p53 in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in the white shrimp in response to hypoxia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Mediterranean diet, considered Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2013, represents a complete and balanced food model with numerous benefits for health, longevity and quality of life, it is characterized by the consumption of fresh produce and of the time, by the frugality, simplicity and sharing a meal.
   Despite being a small farmer, Portugal can bet on cultural diversification and differentiation arising from the intrinsic quality of these products allowed by the unique climate and soil conditions.
   Due to its work process design, can collaborate with the company, it can draw solutions with and for the people, taking into account technical, environmental and economic constraints associated. Through design we can develop partnerships, complement the offering, create educational activities to community, develop a narrative that shows that behind the products there is a history, a way of being and draw an experience based on the nutritional value of the offer and the recommendation of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid.
   We purpose a model that allows Portuguese agro-food SMEs to evaluate the collaboration of design. The model builds a narrative that has underlying the motivation and values which are at the origin of the product and the company and it allows designing an experience based on the nutritional value of the product and the recommendation of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid to improve healthy eating habits or focus on a subject where the food has a decisive role.
   Silves town is applying the design evaluation model in investment in the new brand "Silves, capital da laranja". Its goal is to give notoriety to orange and producers in that region by associating to the name of Silves, recognized for its tangible and intangible heritage, and to the quality and accuracy with which orange is produced.

AB  - Background: Although practice guidelines are based on disorders specified in diagnostic manuals, such as the DSM, practitioners appear to follow symptoms when making treatment decisions. Psychiatric medication is generally prescribed in a transdiagnostic manner, further highlighting how symptoms, not diagnoses, often guide clinical practice. A quantitative approach to nosology promises to provide better guidance as it describes psychopathology dimensionally and its organization reflects patterns of covariation among symptoms.
   Aim: To investigate whether a quantitative classification of emotional disorders can account for naturalistic medication prescription patterns better than traditional diagnoses.
   Methods: Symptom dimensions and DSM diagnoses of emotional disorders, as well as prescribed medications, were assessed using interviews in a psychiatric outpatient sample (N = 318, mean age 42.5 years old, 59% female, 81% Caucasian).
   Results: Each diagnosis was associated with prescription of multiple medication classes, and most medications were associated with multiple disorders. This was largely due to heterogeneity of clinical diagnoses, with narrow, homogenous dimensions underpinning diagnoses showing different medication profiles. Symptom dimensions predicted medication prescription better than DSM diagnoses, irrespective of whether this was examined broadly across all conditions, or focused on a specific disorder and medication indicated for it.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric medication was prescribed in line with symptoms rather than DSM diagnoses. A quantitative approach to nosology may better reflect treatment planning and be a more effective guide to phannacotherapy than traditional diagnoses. This adds to a diverse body of evidence about superiority of the quantitative system in practical applications and highlights its potential to improve psychiatric care. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study investigated causes of persistent fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in beach sand under the pier in Santa Monica, CA. FIB levels were up to 1000 times higher in sand underneath the pier than that collected from adjacent to the pier, with the highest concentrations under the pier in spring and fall. Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT) under the pier were significantly positively correlated with moisture (rho = 0.61, p < 0.001, n = 59; rho = 0.43, p < 0.001, n = 59, respectively), and ENT levels measured by qPCR (qENT) were much higher than those measured by membrane filtration (cENT). Microcosm experiments tested the ability of EC, qENT, cENT, and general Bacteroidales (GenBac) to persist under in situ moisture conditions (10 and 0.1%). Decay rates of qENT, cENT, and GenBac were not significantly different from zero at either moisture level, while decay rates for EC were relatively rapid during the microcosm at 10% moisture (k = 0.7 days(-1)). Gull/pelican marker was detected at 8 of 12 sites and no human-associated markers (TaqHF183 and HumM2) were detected at any site during a 1-day site survey. Results from this study indicate that the high levels of FIB observed likely stem from environmental sources combined with high persistence of FIB under the pier.

AB  - The optical and colorimetric properties of a new chemosensor 4-((2,4-dichlorophenyl) diazenyl)-2-(3-hydroxypropylimino) methyl) phenol (L) for cyanide ions were investigated by the naked-eye detection and UV-vis spectroscopy. This receptor reveals visual changes toward CN- anions in aqueous media. No significant color changes were observed upon the addition of any other anions. The cyanide recognition properties of the receptor through proton-transfer were monitored by UV-vis titration and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The binding constant (K-a) and stoichiometry of the formed host-guest complex were calculated by the Benesi-Hildebrand (B-H) plot and Job's plot method, respectively. The detection limit of the probe towards CN- was 1.03 x 10(-6) mol L-1, which is lower than the maximum value of cyanide (1.9 x 10(-6) mol L-1) permitted by the World Health Organization in drinking water. Thus, this chemosensor was sensitive enough to detect cyanide in aqueous solutions. 1H NMR experiments were conducted to investigate the nature of interaction between the receptor and CN- anions. Notably, the designed sensor can be applied for the rapid detection of cyanide anions in the basic pH range and also under physiological conditions, for practical purposes for a long duration. The sensing behavior of the receptor was further emphasized by computational studies. Quantum-chemical calculations and molecular studies via Density Functional Theory (DFT) were carried out to supplement the experimental results. (C) 2016 Academie des sciences.

AB  - Geological facies modeling is a crucial problem for reservoir characterization as it affects the reservoir heterogeneities and fluid flow performance prediction. The main purpose of this research is to adopt a stochastic simulation to construct 3D lithofacies models of the tidal/estuarine depositional environment of the upper sandstone member in south Rumaila oil field, located in Iraq. Based on core measurements, the upper sandstone member has three main lithofacies: sand, shaly sand, and shale. Literature review indicates that the formation is encompassed of mainly sandstone with some inter-bedded shale zones. To reconstruct the 3D lithofacies model, the sequential indicator simulation (SISIM) was adopted to build the categorical image, pixel by pixel, considering the nonparametric condition distribution. Specifically, SISIM depends on the variogram to address and model the variation between any two spatial points from the available data. Therefore, 12 different variograms were constructed given the three lithofacies in four different azimuth directions: 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees. The resulting lithofacies models in the four selected azimuth directions have shown frequent tidal lithofacies channeling and indicate an approximate matching with the original description of the formation depositional environment of the tidal-dominated and sand-rich environment. The generated lithofacies model in 135 degrees direction has sand channels prevailing towards the southeast shoreline of the reservoir. The created lithofacies model also preserves the reservoir complexity and heterogeneity because it was created using a high-resolution gridding system with approximately two million grids. Additionally, the resulting tidal lithofacies model ensures reservoir heterogeneity as the petrophysical properties are then distributed given each lithofacies with distinct indicator variograms.

AB  - Improving the land-use efficiency (LUE) of farming systems could satisfy increasing global food, feed, biomass and bioenergy demand in a sustainable manner. This study presents a new method for calculating LUE, beginning with an overview of different approaches to assessing agricultural LUE. This new method takes into account the quality and function of agricultural products and the relationship between the yield of the assessed farm and the average yield of the reference region with comparable soils, climate and socio-economic conditions.
   The new approach was tested using data from long-term experiments at the Scheyern Research Farm in southern Germany, which include different farming systems (organic mixed farming, arable farming, and agroforestry; conventional arable farming and agroforestry). In our case studies, the WE of conventional systems (arable farming: 1.00; improved arable farming: 1.06; agroforestry: 0.98) was higher than those of the organic systems (mixed farming: 0.69; arable farming: 0.33; agroforestry: 0.43) due to different crop rotations, dry matter yields, and biomass usage (harvest ratio). The conversion of high-input arable farming systems (conventional farming) to agroforestry systems is an extensification with negative effects on the dry matter yield and land-use efficiency. Nevertheless, the conversion to agroforestry systems can increase dry matter yield and land-use efficiency in low-input arable farming systems (organic farming). LUE should be used in combination with agri-environmental indicators, in order to ensure both efficient and sustainable land use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developed countries reaffirm the role of agriculture in the functioning of the entire economy, emphasizing the importance of agricultural production. Faced with the need for greater investment in agriculture while directing new investments into underdeveloped rural areas, transitional countries must realistically assess their potentials and limitations in this area. The aim of the study is to define the characteristics of the SME sector during structural changes in agriculture, which is one of the drivers of economic development of Serbia. This study analyzes the current state of the sector of small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs in agriculture and examines indicators that point to their development. How to encourage the development of agricultural production in a country that has experienced a complete economic collapse? Why do incentives to entrepreneurship and agricultural production in the Republic of Serbia have no expected effects? Institutions of the Government of the Republic of Serbia have created a whole spectrum of economic and fiscal incentives after the 5th October changes, but the effects of such programs are limited. Political managing of funds, institutions and ministries reduces the efficiency and transparency of the program, which greatly reduces the scope and importance of these programs in a healthier business environment. Serbia's determination to continue European integration obliges economic policy makers to comply with the most important economic development documents and strategies accepted by EU countries. General economic development must provide the conditions for further successive expansion of agricultural production in Serbia, while at the same time undertaking measures for the modernization of agricultural holdings as part of integral development.

AB  - Copper (Cu) plays crucial biochemical and physiological functions in plants. However, at high concentrations, Cu can become extremely toxic, inducing several physiological changes and symptoms of toxicity. The aim was to analyze the anatomical and physiological changes of the bromeliad, Billbergia zebrina, in response to Cu excess under in vitro conditions. B. zebrina plants, previously established in vitro, were transferred to culture media containing 0, 2, 20, or 200 A mu M Cu. Growth traits and enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase were measured over a period of 80 days. To verify the biological activity of roots grown under different Cu concentrations, a biospeckle laser was used at 20 and 80 days. Biomass accumulation, Cu content and anatomical analyses were performed at 80 days. Plants did not show any visible signs of disturbance and all plants survived the experimental treatments. Plants grown with 200 A mu M Cu showed anatomical changes, such as increased stomatal index and thicker exodermal cell walls of the roots, which may aid in heavy metal tolerance. High biological activity was observed only at 20 days. This biological activity was linked to increased thickness of the cell wall at the exodermis. The Cu content evidenced that the anatomical changes were effective against the transport of excess Cu into the plants. Although Cu exposure affected leaf and root anatomy as well as growth, exposure only induced minimal changes in the antioxidant system. B. zebrina tolerates high amounts of Cu and could potentially be used as a bioindicator species.

AB  - Peatland ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle as significant C sinks. However, human-induced disturbances can turn these sinks into sources of atmospheric CO2. Long-term measurements are needed to understand seasonal and interannual variability of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and effects of hydrological conditions and their disturbances on C fluxes. Continuous eddy-covariance measurements of NEE were conducted between August 2010 and April 2014 at Yenicaga temperate peatland (Turkey), which was drained for agricultural usage and for peat mining until 2009. Annual NEE during the three full years of measurement indicated that the peatland acted as a CO2 source with large interannual variability, at rates of 246, 244 and 663 g Cm-2 yr(-1) for 2011, 2012, and 2013 respectively, except for June 2011, and May to July 2012. The emission strengths were comparable to those found for severely disturbed tropical peatlands. The peak CO2 emissions occurred in the dry summer of 2013 when water table level (WTL) was below a threshold value of -60 cm and soil water content (SCW) below a threshold value of 70% by volume. Water availability index was found to have a stronger explanatory power for variations in monthly ecosystem respiration (ER) than the traditional water status indicators (SCW and WTL). Air temperature, evapotranspiration and vapor pressure deficient were the most significant variables strongly correlated with NEE and its component fluxes of gross primary production and ER.

AB  - As mobile data capture tools for patient-reported outcomes proliferate in clinical research, a key dimension of measure performance is sensitivity to change. This study compared performance of patient-reported measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety symptoms using traditional paper and-pencil forms versus real-time, ambulatory measurement of symptoms via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Sixty-seven emotionally distressed older adults completed paper-and-pencil measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety along with two weeks of identical items reported during ambulatory monitoring via EMA before and after participation in a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a health education intervention. We calculated effect sizes for these measures across both measurement approaches and estimated the Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) in both measurement conditions. Study outcomes greatly differed depending on which measurement method was used. When EMA was used to measure clinical symptoms, older adults who participated in the MBSR intervention had significantly higher mindfulness and significantly lower depression and anxiety than participants in the health education intervention at post-treatment. However, these significant changes in symptoms were not found when outcomes were measured with paper-and-pencil measures. The NNT for mindfulness and depression measures administered through EMA were approximately 25-50% lower than NNTs derived from paper-and-pencil administration. Sensitivity to change in anxiety was similar across administration modes. In conclusion, EMA measures of depression and mindfulness substantially outperformed paper-and-pencil measures with the same items. The additional resources associated with EMA in, clinical trials would seem to be offset by its greater sensitivity to detect change in key outcome variables. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective Karoshi, which is the Japanese term for death from over-work, is usually the extreme result of cardiovascular diseases, and occupational stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis. Depression is closely associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The present study was undertaken to examine the relationship between occupational stress and depression.
   Methods We enrolled 231 consecutive outpatients with lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension were enrolled. Occupational stress was measured by qualitative constructs assessing job control, job demands, and worksite social support using a job content questionnaire (JCQ). The job strain index measured by the ratio of job demands to job control was used as an indicator of the occupational stress. Depression was evaluated by the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS).
   Results A univariate linear regression analysis showed the SDS scores to be positively correlated with job demands and the job strain index and negatively correlated with job control and worksite social support. Multiple regression analyses to predict the SDS scores demonstrated that job demands were positively associated with SDS scores and job control and worksite social support were negatively associated with SDS scores after controlling for other variables. The job strain index was positively related to SDS scores.
   Conclusion Occupational stress expressed as the job strain index was strongly associated with depression. By simultaneously using the SDS and JCQ, the health conditions of patients could be classified based on occupational stress and mental stress, and this classification could help to promote a healthy work environment and guide individual workers.

AB  - Polychaetes have been identified by several authors as a group of marine invertebrates that respond rapidly to anthropogenic stressors. However, studies investigating alterations in Polychaetes affected by climate changes are scarce. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the impact of salinity changes (14, 21, 28, 35, 42 g/L) on the physiological and biochemical performance of the Polychaete Diopatra neapolitana, evaluating the species regenerative ability and biochemical alterations.
   The results obtained demonstrated that organisms exposed to extreme salinity conditions (14, 21 and 42 g/L) presented higher mortality rates, needed more days to completely regenerate the missing body region and also regenerated less chaetigers, when compared to organisms exposed to salinities 28 and 35 g/L. The present study further demonstrated that D. neapolitana presented significantly lower glycogen and protein content at salinities 21 and 42 g/L, which can be explained by higher energy expenditure in the physiological and biochemical processes. A marked impairment of the glutathione redox status was also recorded at salinities 21 and 42 g/L. Increased antioxidant enzyme activities were observed at salinity 21 g/L while LPO levels were increased at salinity 42 g/L.
   Overall the present study demonstrated that the regenerative capacity of D. neapolitana can be used as a tool to assess environmental changes, namely salinity shifts. Moreover, stress related biomarkers revealed to be useful to evaluate the alterations in Polychaetes due to salinity changes. D. neapolitana revealed to be a good bioindicator to salinity alterations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditionally managed Central European mountain grasslands have high nature conservation value because of their high species diversity. Whether these grasslands and their diversity can be preserved will depend on many factors, including how plant species composition responds to changes in climate conditions. To differentiate between fluctuations and directional succession in the herbaceous layer composition of a Romanian Festuca rubra L. and Agrostis capillarts L. grassland in Apuseni and whether any compositional changes can be related CO climate. The vegetation of permanent plots was recorded annually between 2004 and 2012. Temperature and precipitation were measured by an automatic weather station at the study site. Cluster analysis, Indicator Species Analysis and the co-dominance ratio between F. rubra L. - A. capillaris were analysed. The compositional data was related to the climate variables. Thresholds of relevant climate variables differentiating between clusters of plots with similar vegetation composition were determined using classification tree methods. The vegetation composition in our plots within the years 2004, 2005 and 2008 were different from each other. From 2004 to 2006 directional succession could be identified; however the major patterns to emerge were fluctuations which occurred over the whole study period. Compositional shifts included A. capillaris L. and F. rubra L exchanging co-dominance with each other. The MOSE important variables differentiating clusters were temperature during the dormant and vegetation periods and water balance during the vegetation period. It can be concluded that compositional shifts among years were largely a consequence of year to year climatic fluctuations; however, there is some evidence for a directional shift during the early years of the study.

AB  - Numerous bioarcheological investigations have suggested that as agriculture intensifies, levels of physiological stress and poor health increase. However, previous research in Southeast Asia suggests that a decline in health was not universal. This study aimed to provide the first investigation of human health during the intensification of rice agriculture in the large skeletal sample from the prehistoric site of Ban Non Wat, Northeast Thailand (1750-420 b.c.). Health was analysed using two indicators of childhood stress, the prevalence of linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), a measure of early childhood stress, and stature, as a measure of late childhood stress, were collated for 190 adults. Sex-specific diachronic relationships between the prevalence of LEH and stature were explored. For both sexes, initially the prevalence of LEH was found to decrease and then increase over time. Stature remained constant over time for males, although for females stature increased initially, then decreased. Early childhood stress was not significantly correlated with stature in females (P = 0.185), but high levels of LEH were unexpectedly correlated with taller male stature (P = 0.017). Our findings suggest an initial improvement in health during agricultural intensification at this site, likely related to a reduction in physiological perturbations and maintenance of a nutritious diet during this time. The subsequent deterioration in health may reflect geomorphologically and archaeologically indicated variation in environmental conditions and consequential sociocultural changes. We suggest that the sex-differences in the relationship between stature and LEH may relate to the timing of stress and/or catch-up growth. Am J Phys Anthropol 153:484-495, 2014.

AB  - Paenibacillus larvae, a sporulating Gram-positive bacterium, is the etiological agent of American foulbrood disease in Apis mellifera L. Plant extracts could be a natural alternative to control this pathology. The current study assessed the anti-P. larvae effect of extracts and pure principal products from the Flourensia genus: F. riparia, F. fiebrigii and F. tortuosa. Their inhibitory effect was assayed against different P. larvae strains according to the disk diffusion technique and subsequently, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of extracts by the agar dilution method was determined. Furthermore, toxicity of the most effective extracts against P. larvae was tested in bees. All extracts inhibited growth of the different P. larvae strains assayed. However, the magnitude of the antagonistic effect depended on the chemical nature of the extract and the P. larvae strain. Chloroform extracts (CE) and ethyl ether extracts (ETE) from F. riparia and ETE from F. fiebrigii were most active against P. larvae Azul, the most sensitive indicator strain with MIC values of 250 ppm (CE) and 2000 ppm (ETE) for F. riparia, and 2500 ppm (ETE) for F. fiebrigii. Hexane extracts from the three species did not present any significant inhibitory effect. These results would indicate that one or some of the more polar compounds would cause inhibition of this pathogen. Toxicity assays demonstrated that even the highest concentrations assayed (125,000 ppm) did not show lethal effects on exposed bees during in vitro conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Arcellacea (testate lobose amoebae) were examined in 24 sediment-water interface samples collected over two late August field seasons in 2010 and 2011, from James and Granite lakes, Temagami Region, Northeastern Ontario. The work was carried out to quantitatively test species-environment relationships in a lake system known to be characterized by a significant pH gradient, partially the result of contamination from the early twentieth century Northland Pyrite Mine Co., located on the shoreline in the southern basin of James Lake. Redundancy analysis confirmed that arcellacean assemblage structure was most strongly controlled by pH, explaining 14.06 % (p < 0.002) of the total variance. Q- and R-mode cluster analysis supported by detrended correspondence analysis yielded two major faunal assemblages. The Oligotrophic Assemblage (1) had a Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) ranging up to 2.45, typical of healthy boreal lakes. This assemblage characterized samples collected from higher pH stations within James and Granite lakes away from the immediate area of the mine site, while the Low pH Assemblage 2010 (2a) and Low pH Assemblage 2011 (2b) groupings were from the very low pH environments of James Lake adjacent to the former mine site. Both low diversity assemblages (SDI ranging from 0.62 to 1.22) were characterized by Arcella vulgaris, a species known to thrive in hostile lacustrine environments. Differing depositional conditions during August 2010, a probable result of different prevailing wind patterns that summer, led to allochthonous specimens of the seasonally planktic Cucurbitella tricuspis dominating the Low pH Assemblage 2010 (2a) fauna.

AB  - A novel cost-effective Bacillus atrophaeus Sterilization Bioindicator System (BIS) with a high quality and performance was developed from a soybean byproduct and compared with the commercial BIS. It was composed of recovery medium and dry-fermented spores with sand as the support. The BIS was developed and optimized using a sequential experimental design strategy. The recovery medium contained soluble starch (1.0 g/L), soybean molasses (30.0 g/L), tryptone (40.0 g/L), and bromothymol blue (0.02 g/L) at pH 8.5. The solid-state fermentation conditions of the bioreactor and environmental humidity had no significant effects on the spore yield and dry-heat resistance. The only substrate mineral that showed a positive effect was Mn2+, allowing Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ to be eliminated from the formulation. Validation of optimized medium indicated D (160A degrees C) = 6.8 +/- 1.0 min (3.6 min more than the minimum) and spore yield = 2.3 +/- 0.5 x 10(9) CFU/g dry sand (10,000 x initial values). BIS performance resulted in D (160A degrees C) = 6.6 +/- 0.1 min. Sporulation and germination kinetics allowed the sporulation process to be reduced to three days, and the growth of heat-damaged spores was sufficient to achieve visual identification of a non-sterile BIS within 21 h. Process economics was a minimum of 23.9%, and process cycle time was reduced from 29 to 15 days. The new BIS parameters demonstrated compliance to all regulatory requirements. No studies have yet described a BIS production from soybean molasses.

AB  - Semi-natural dry grasslands host some of the most valuable habitats in Europe, due to their biodiversity heritage. Nevertheless, a strong decline in their extension, due to the cessation of traditional management, has been observed in the last decades. The aim of the study was to assess plant community changes due to abandonment and the effect of spring grazing in sub-Mediterranean dry grasslands, focusing on the plant functional traits involved in this turnover.
   The study area is located in the central Apennines (Italy), where grasslands were grazed by sheep in late winter and spring until 1980 and are nowadays abandoned. Releves sampled (using the Braun-Blanquet method) in different years, namely in 1976-1980 (grazed pasture) and again in 2010 (abandoned pasture) were compared. Results indicated that abandonment leads to the increase of species richness. Traits and strategies indicator sets were: therophyte for the grazed pasture; geophytes, flower palatability, early flowering strategy, clonal ability and presence of storage organs for the abandoned ones. Traits related to low levels of stress (tolerance strategies) are heavily reduced in grazed systems, and thus the functional composition of plant community is mostly characterised by traits promoting avoidance strategies. In abandoned conditions a higher number of species can co-exist thanks to the micro-scale variation of soil features and niche diversification. The research findings also revealed grazing timing as a key factor for understanding changes of plant functional trait patterns and spring grazing as a threat for orchid species.

AB  - Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine] is a herbicide widely used in large quantities in agricultural applications. It is also known to form complexes with metal ions, although its influence on metal behavior, such as lead (Pb) in soil, is not well understood. In this study, the adsorption and co-adsorption of Pb and glyphosate were determined on two soils [a red (RS) soil, Udic Ferrisol, and a yellow-brown (YB) soil, Udic Luvisol] of distinctly different chemical characteristics at varying pH conditions. Results indicate that the adsorption of lead and glyphosate strongly depends on soil types: the RS soil, characterized by a relatively high iron/aluminum content but a low pH and organic matter content, shows a much lower adsorption capacity for Pb but a higher sorption for glyphosate than the YB soil. The co-existence of Pb and glyphosate in soils resulted in complex interactions among Pb, glyphosate, Pb-glyphosate complexes, and soil minerals. The presence of glyphosate decreased Pb adsorption on the two soils, which was attributed primarily to the formation of soluble Pb-glyphosate complexes having relatively low affinities to soil surfaces. On the other hand, addition of Pb increased the adsorption of glyphosate on both soils, which was attributed to: (1) a decreased solution pH due to the ion exchange between Pb2+ and H+ on soil surfaces; and (2) increased sorption sites where Pb was adsorbed and acted as a bridge between glyphosate and the soil. The present study illustrates that the complex interactions among glyphosate, Pb, and soil may have important implications for the mobility and bioavailability of Pb in soil and should thus be considered in future environmental risk assessments.

AB  - The rural population of semi-arid lands in Kenya face multiple challenges that result from population growth, poor markets, land use and climatic changes. In particular, subsistence oriented farmers face various risks and opportunities in their attempt to secure their livelihoods. This paper presents an analysis on how livelihood assets and strategies of smallholders in Laikipia County, Kenya, have changed within the last decade and discusses the implications for development interventions. The analysis is based on bi-temporal data from 170 semi-structured household interviews in 1997 and a follow-up survey of 30 households conducted in 2010. Well-being indicators were developed and livelihood portfolios compared. The results show a striking persistence in low asset endowment for the majority of smallholders from an aggregated perspective, whereas transitions into and out of better livelihood conditions become evident from a household perspective. The investment in, and accumulation of, conventional buffer or productive assets, such as grain stocks, livestock or land, does not shield households from adverse shocks and stresses as smallholders were shown to easily slip back into poverty. Household portfolios display particular constraints for smallholders in expanding natural resource related activities and a substantial decrease in livestock numbers. While off-farm activities could possibly increase well-being, the prevailing low income levels and high insecurity for the majority who are engaged in off-farm employment, limits the ability to increase livelihood assets in the area.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the flora and vegetation of three well-preserved hardwood floodplain forest areas along the river Danube and to discuss whether possible differences between the floodplain forests can be linked to river eutrophication. Flora and vegetation data from three study areas located on the Upper, Middle and Lower Danube in Central and Eastern Europe were compared using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Special attention was paid to floristic composition, plant functional types, and ecological indicator values. We found that the three studied hardwood floodplain forests appeared to be rather different regarding floristic composition and herb-layer vegetation. Despite the high beta diversity, the distribution of the plant functional types indicated generally equal habitat conditions, which were quite stable. The diversity of herb-layer vegetation decreased downstream, while the indicators of nutrient availability pointed to increasing nutrient supply. The factor light apparently played a minor role for herb-layer diversity. There is a remarkable congruence between the results of our floodplain vegetation analysis and the longitudinal river eutrophication patterns as described in the literature. We conclude that the nutrient input into Danubian hardwood floodplain forests increased downstream, resulting in higher nutrient availability for plants. This promoted especially the growth of tall and competitive forbs, which outcompeted other plant species. Even if the importance of the various eutrophication patterns is difficult to quantify, our study provides evidence that anthropogenic eutrophication has a distinct effect on the flora and vegetation of Danubian hardwood floodplain forests.

AB  - Soil formation under aerobic conditions usually enhances magnetic signals, mainly through neoformation of sub-micron magnetite and/or maghemite. In order to better understand the nature and magnitude of the enhancement, in this work we characterized the iron (Fe) oxides and magnetic properties of two Calcic Luvisols (Chromic) developed on calcareous orthoquartzites in a Spanish region with a warm Mediterranean climate. Weathering of the Fe-bearing minerals in the parent material (mostly Fe-rich smectite) had resulted in the neoformation of hematite and maghemite rather than goethite, thus causing a substantial increase in magnetic susceptibility, chi, saturation magnetization, M, and other magnetic signals. The absolute frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility, chi(FD), which is a typical proxy for the concentration of sub-micron superparamagnetic pedogenic maghemite, was strongly correlated with the concentration of hematite (Hm). The estimated percent frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility, chi(FD)%, Was 15.7%. This and various other magnetic indicators indicate that the grain size distribution (GSD) of the pedogenic maghemite is narrower around the superparamagnetic/single domain threshold than is that of maghemite in soils and paleosols developed under other temperate climates (e.g., the Chinese Loesss Plateau, where chi(FD)%< 13%). Our results are consistent with predictions based on the ferrihydrite -> maghemite -> hematite transformation model. Also, they suggest that a wise combination of the HM/chi(FD) ratio, chi(FD)%, the hematite/goethite ratio. and several indicators of the degree of weathering provides a better tool for paleoclimatic reconstructions than does the current use of chi alone.

AB  - Question
   What is the relationship between plant diversity and species turnover in coastal dune vegetation plots? How is the long-term change in species composition of vegetation plots related to shifts in functional traits, and what does it tell us about the dominant processes?
   Location
   Coastal dunes, the Netherlands.
   Methods
   Our data set comprised 52 years of vegetation data from 35 permanent plots in grassland/scrub/woodland vegetation. Vegetation dynamics were described in terms of changes in species composition and abundance, and shifts in 13 functional traits related to resources capture and forage quality, regeneration and dispersal.
   Results
   Species turnover in the plots was high, because of local extinction and colonization. Species-rich plots were more stable in terms of species abundance and composition compared with species-poor plots. Over time, the plots converged with respect to their abiotic conditions, as reflected by Ellenberg indicator values - indicating that the prevailing process was succession. The high species turnover reflected high invasibility: accordingly, the relative importance of annuals increased. Most newcomer annuals, however, were competitive generalists of little conservation value. The functional trait analysis allowed us to unravel the complexity of effects of disturbances and succession, and yielded information on the processes driving the observed vegetation dynamics.
   Conclusions
   In this study, small-scale species turnover was negatively related to species diversity, indicating more stability in species-rich communities. Regarding shifts in trait diversity, unifying filters appeared to be more dominant than diversifying filters. Counteracting this homogenization process poses a challenge for nature management.

AB  - Morphology, total sulfur content and stable sulfur isotopic composition of Zostera marina were examined in the Baltic Sea-Skagerrak transition zone through surveys. The seagrass meadows were denser and less productive at the low salinities in the Baltic Sea (salinity 6-7 psu), and total sulfur accumulations in plants were lower and delta S-34 values were higher compared to the west coast of Sweden (salinity 2129 psu). The delta S-34 values of the three plant compartments (leaves, rhizomes, roots) indicated lower sulfide invasion at low salinities, which was mainly due to environmental conditions (e.g. low epiphytic biomass, low sediment organic matter and low sulfate concentration) and plant characteristics (productivity, shoot morphology). Between 13% and 63% of the sulfur in the plants was derived from sediment sulfides with highest percentages in the roots (27-63%) and lower in rhizomes (13-50%) and leaves (14-51%). The high sulfide invasion on the west coast of Sweden was coincident with high sediment organic matter, probably increasing sulfide pressure on the plants, and high epiphytic biomass, probably constraining the oxygen dynamics in the plants and enhancing sulfide invasion. Regional and spatial variability in the delta S-34 were extensive, emphasizing the need for detailed analysis of local sources when applying stable sulfur isotopes in food web analyses. The observed invasion of sulfides suggests sulfide as a contributing factor to reported declines of Z. marina in the Skagerrak region. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite its relevance for the persistence of populations, the ecological mechanisms underlying habitat use decisions of juvenile birds are poorly understood. We examined postfledging habitat selection of radio-tracked juvenile middle spotted woodpeckers Dendrocopos medius at multiple hierarchically-nested spatial scales in NW Spain. At the landscape and home range scales, old oak forest was the most used and selected habitat, young oak forests and pine plantations were avoided, and riverside forests were used as available. At a lower scale, birds selected larger diameter trees for foraging. Home ranges had higher densities of large deciduous trees (mainly oaks Quercus spp., but also poplars Populus spp. and willows Salix spp. > 22 cm and > 33 cm DBH) selected for foraging by juveniles than non-used areas. These results suggest that foraging conditions may drive, at least partly, habitat use decisions by juvenile birds. We also discuss the potential influence of intraspecific competition, the search for a future breeding territory in the early postfledging period and predation avoidance on habitat use decisions by juvenile birds. Contrary to previous studies on migrant forest birds, postfledging juvenile woodpeckers selected the same habitat as for the breeding adults (i.e. old oak forest), indicating that migrant and resident specialist avian species may require different conservation actions. Conservation strategies of woodpecker populations should consider the protection of old oak forests with high densities of large trees to provide suitable habitat to breeding adults and postfledging juveniles. The habitat improvement for this indicator and umbrella species would also favour other organisms that depend on characteristics of old-growth oak forests.

AB  - Nutrient management plans (NMPs) for application of wastewater from concentrated animal feeding operations are designed to meet crop water and nutrient requirements, but implicitly assume that pathogenic microorganisms in the wastewater will be retained and die-off in the root zone. A NMP was implemented on a field plot to test this assumption by monitoring the fate of several fecal indicator microorganisms (Enterococcus, fecal coliforms, somatic coliphage, and total Escherichia coli). When well-water and wastewater were applied to meet measured evapotranspiration (ET), little advective transport of the indicator microorganisms occurred below the root zone and the remaining microorganisms rapidly died-off (within 1 mo). Additional experiments were conducted in the laboratory to better quantify microorganism transport and survival in the field soil. Batch survival experiments revealed much more rapid die-off rates for the bacterial indicator microorganisms in native than in sterilized sod, suggesting that biotic factors controlled survival. Saturated column experiments with packed field soil, demonstrated much greater transport potential for somatic coliphage than bacterial indicators (Enterococcus and total E colt) and that the retention rates for the indicator microorganisms were not log-linear with depth. A worst case transport scenario of ponded infiltration on a large undistributed soil column from the field was also initiated and indicator microorganisms were not detected in the column outflow or in the soil at a depth of 65 cm. All of these observations support the hypothesis that a NMP at this site will protect groundwater Supplies from microorganism contamination, especially when applied water and wastewater meet ET.

AB  - The ability to quantitatively and spatially assess soil surface roughness is important in geomorphology and land degradation studies. This paper describes the results of an experiment designed to investigate whether hyperspectral directional reflectance factors can describe fine-scale variations in soil surface roughness. A Canadian silt loam soil was sieved to an aggregate size range of 1-4.75 mm and exposed to five different artificial rainfall durations to produce soils displaying progressively decreasing levels of surface roughness. Each soil state was measured using a point laser profiling instrument at 2 mm spatial resolution, in order to provide information on the structure and spatial arrangement of soil particles. Hyperspectral directional reflectance factors were measured using an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro Spectroradiometer (range 350-2500 nm), at a range of measurement angles (theta(r) = -60 degrees to +60 degrees) and illumination angle conditions (theta(i) = 28 degrees-74 degrees). Directional reflectance factors varied with illumination and view angles, and with soil structure. Geostatistically-derived indicators of soil surface roughness (sill variance) were regressed with directional reflectance factors. The results showed a strong relationship between directional reflectance and surface roughness (R-2 = 0.94 where theta(r) = -60 degrees, theta(i) = 67 degrees-74 degrees). This fine-scale quasi-natural experiment allowed the control of slope, initial aggregate size and rainfall exposure, permitting an investigation into factors affecting a soil's bidirectional reflectance response. This has highlighted the relationship between fine-scale variations in surface roughness, illumination angle and reflectance response. The results show how the technique could provide a quantitative measure of surface roughness at fine spatial scales.

   The Water Framework Directive EU2000/60/EC (WFD) was implemented for reservoirs at a regional scale (northeastern Spain). Twenty-one reservoirs were monitored quarterly over the course of a year. Using principal component analysis, the reservoirs were classified into types according to their geological and morphometric features. The Ecological Quality (EQ) of the reservoirs was assessed by integrating values of total chlorophyll a, cyanophyta chlorophyll a concentration, fish metrics, Secchi depth, averaged hypolimnetic oxygen concentration and total phosphorus. For each reservoir type, a reference condition of quality was selected. When possible, this reference was the reservoir displaying the best EQ; otherwise expert judgment was used. To allow comparison of quality among reservoirs belonging to different types, thus identifying intrinsic differences, an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) was calculated by dividing the EQ value of each reservoir by that of its reference. According to EQR, the majority of the reservoirs accomplished the quality criteria of the WFD. This study identified a number of useful indicators for EQ assessment. Moreover, because the references were chosen among similar reservoirs, low EQR values are indicative of specific problems, such as untreated or wastewater spills or droughts. The results also demonstrate that expert judgment is a reasonable compromise when the low number of water bodies available for the study prevents statistical approaches.

AB  - We isolated 137 fungal strains from females and eggs of Meloidogyne spp. collected from plant roots and infested soil in Jiangsu, China, and examined their in vitro protease production and chitinase activities. We then selected 20 strains, each with a protease production higher than 2 (protease production was measured as the ratio of diameters of the zone of clearing to that of the colony) and a chitinase activity higher than 0.2 U/min mL. For these strains, we examined their egg parasitic rates, mortality rates of stage 2 juvenile (J2), egg hatching rates and evaluated their biocontrol efficacies under greenhouse conditions. The biocontrol efficacies of these 20 potential biocontrol fungal strains ranged from 29 to 58%. The actual biocontrol efficacy against Meloidogyne root-knot was highly correlated with the in vitro protease production (r=0.82), chitinase activity (r=0.80), and mortality of J2 (r=0.76), but poorly correlated with the egg parasitic rate (r=0.51) and the egg hatch rate (r=0.52). Based on these results, we suggest that in vitro protease production or chitinase activities of the fungal strains could be an applicable indicator for assessing biocontrol efficacy against nematodes. This notion was also supported by our field experiments on tomatoes with Paecilomyces lilacinus strains XT18, XCS46 and Pochonia chlamydosporia strain XT124, which reached the biocontrol efficacies of 60.7, 51.5 and 48.1% in 2007; and 67.8, 57.3 and 53.2% in 2008, respectively.

AB  - Abnormal tests were commonly found in recent benthic foraminiferal assemblages in two fjords of the Kiel Bay, the western Baltic Sea. We assessed 18 different types of abnormalities, which were classified into five groups: chamber, apertural, umbilical, coiling and test abnormalities. In both fjords, test abnormalities are over-represented in Ammonia heccarii and under-represented in Elphidium excavatum subspecies compared to their average proportions in the living assemblages. We found two species-specific abnormality types that occurred only in Ammonia beccarii: a bulla-like chamber covering the umbilicus and spiroconvex tests.
   In the outer Kiel and Flensburg Fjords, the highest frequencies of abnormal tests were associated with occasional salt-rich, bottom-water inflow's from the Belt Sea. Based on the predominance of megalospheric specimens of living foraminifera, it is suggested that coincidence of salinity changes with a reproduction period might be harmful especially for young individuals, leading to development of abnormal tests. On the other hand, pollution by heavy metals led to higher percentages of abnormal tests in the inner parts of both fjords. Our data show different relationships between abnormal tests and heavy metals in both fjords due to different hydrographical conditions.
   Tests of Ammonia beccarii found in the Gelting Bay, the Pal Flensburg Fjord, showed traces of dissolution and development of double tests. Such specific abnormal tests mirror the peculiar environmental setting characterized by changes in salinity and enhanced sediment redeposition. It is concluded that abnormal tests as an indicator of environmental pollution haw to be used cautiously in areas with strong environmental instability.

AB  - During the last decade, isotopic fractionation has gained acceptance as an indicator of microbiological and chemical transformations of contaminants in groundwater. These transformation processes typically favor isotopically light, compared to isotopically heavy, contaminants, resulting in enrichment of the latter in the residual aqueous phase. In these isotope applications, it has been generally presumed that physical transport processes in groundwater have a negligible effect on isotopic enrichment. It is well known, however, that aqueous phase diffusion generally proceeds faster for isotopically light, compared to isotopically heavy, solute molecules, often resulting in isotopic fractionation in groundwater. This paper considers the potential for isotopic fractionation during transport in groundwater resulting from minute isotopic effects on aqueous diffusion coefficients. Analyses of transport in heterogeneous systems delimit the viable range of isotopic fractionation by diffusion in groundwater. Results show that diffusion can result in similar degrees of depletion and enrichment of isotopically heavy solutes during transport in heterogeneous systems with significant diffusion rate - limited mass transfer between fast- and slow-flow zones. Additional analyses and examples explore conditions that attenuate the development of significant fractionation. Examples are presented for (13)C methyl tertiary butyl ether and deuterated and nondeuterated isopropanol and tertiary butyl alcohol using aqueous diffusion coefficients measured by the Taylor dispersion method with refractive index profiling as a part of this study. Examples elucidate the potential for diffusive fractionation as a confounder in isotope applications and emphasize the importance of hydrogeologic analysis for assessing the role of diffusive fractionation in isotope applications at contaminant field sites.

AB  - 1. Populations of white-footed mice Peromyscus leucopus and deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus increase dramatically in response to food availability from oak acorn masts. These populations subsequently decline following this resource pulse, but these crashes cannot be explained solely by resource depletion, as food resources are still available as population crashes begin.
   2. We hypothesized that intestinal parasites contribute to these post-mast crashes; Peromyscus are infected by many intestinal parasites that are often transmitted by density-dependent contact and can cause harm to their hosts. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a factorial experiment in natural populations by supplementing food to mimic a mast and by removal of intestinal nematodes with the drug, ivermectin.
   3. Both food supplementation and the removal of intestinal nematodes lessened the rate and magnitude of the seasonal population declines as compared with control populations. However, the combination of food supplementation and removal of intestinal nematodes prevented seasonal population crashes entirely.
   4. We also showed a direct effect on the condition of individuals. Faecal corticosterone levels, an indicator of the stress response, were significantly reduced in populations receiving both food supplementation and removal of intestinal nematodes. This effect was observed in autumn, before the overwinter crash observed in control populations, which may indicate that stress caused by the combination of food limitation and parasite infection is a physiological signal that predicts low winter survival and reproduction.
   5. This study is one of the few to demonstrate that the interaction between resource availability and infectious disease is important for shaping host population dynamics and emphasizes that multiple factors may drive oscillations in wild animal populations.

AB  - The Hallilwell-Asada-Foyer redox cascade (HAF) is viewed as a H(2)O(2) detoxifying system with a great variety of responses against environmental changes. The functional consequences of these responses are interpreted intuitively because a systemic analysis of the inherent dynamic potential of the HAF is lacking. With the help of numerical modelling we show that in wheat roots parameter patterns are established which result in homeostatic states of HAF over a vast range of environmental changes. The reduced fractions glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (ASC) remain on high levels even during dramatic chances in the enzyme activity ratios of glutathione reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and ascorbat peroxidase. Necessarily their oxidised counterparts dithioglutathione (GSSG) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) stay in these buffered regions on very low concentration levels. Our modelling shows that redox ratios GSH/GSSG and ASC/DHA can be modified additionally via changes in NADPH/H(2)O(2) ratios. Thus, the redox states of GSH and ASC can not simply be regarded as indicators for oxidative stress with respect to H(2)O(2) levels. The involvement of the redox variables in other redox processes than the HAF reaction (redox proteome) and/or their utilisation in metabolism (protein modification, detoxification of xenobiotics) are viewed to cause system relaxations of the redox variables. The re-establishment of their homeostatic ratios follow time courses which are redox moiety specific and are balanced according to the existing parameter patterns. Despite of its detoxification function the HAF balances the glutathione/ ascorbate redox state in cells according to the prevailing physiological conditions.

AB  - Recent biological inventory data shows severe declines in freshwater mussel abundance and biodiversity in the Conasauga River Basin in Northwest Georgia, USA. Based on assessments of habitat conditions, mussel populations should be sustainable. We conducted a study of sediment and water quality to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic contamination on mussel populations. Permeable membrane devices (PMD), polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS(TM)), conventional water and sediment quality analyses, and stable nitrogen isotope ratio analyses (delta N-15) of snails and sediments were used to assess sediment and water quality at target sites throughout the basin. Ambient concentrations of organic contaminants in water were well below any aquatic life criteria; concentrations of some nutrients were detected above aquatic life criteria levels. Most mussel species in the river are endangered or threatened; therefore, snails were collected for delta N-15 analyses. Mean delta N-15 values for snails collected at forested upper watershed sites (national forest areas) were significantly lower than delta N-15 values from snails in agricultural areas. delta N-15 values for raw cow manure and manure-treated soil were similar to delta N-15 values for snails collected in agricultural areas. Dissolved nitrate from water samples had elevated delta N-15 values similar to the upper range of delta N-15 values for snails in agricultural areas. Data, particularly stable nitrogen isotope data, indicates that a land use change from national forest land to agriculture alters nitrogen sources to the basin and snails. Implications of nutrient release on freshwater molluscan reproduction, growth, and survival are discussed.

T2  - DESALINATION
LA  - English
CP  - International Conference on New Water Culture of South East European Countries (AQUA 2005)
AB  - The real-time water quality monitoring network of Evrotas River has been operational in Laconia since July 2004. The experience of more than a year of function has shown that dissolved oxygen is one of the most useful parameters monitored for warning and quality status classification. Concentration of dissolved oxygen in surface water is known to be a critical parameter for water quality and survival of organisms in it. At the same time, it provides an indication of the organic load in water, as well as the potential eutrophication. Dissolved oxygen in surface water normally depends on the atmosphere pressure and temperature that affect oxygen solubility. Real-time monitoring provides a very useful option through data processing that could not otherwise be implemented by conventional monitoring programs of any frequency. It is possible to monitor all daily variations of dissolved oxygen, replacing the unique value of one measurement in a conventional program, with a series of 144 measurements (every 10 min) regressing around a moving average value. This form of time series permits monitoring of the daily amplitude of dissolved oxygen fluctuation, which is an accessory indicator of the water quality status. This frequency permits dissolved oxygen to be utilized as a warning parameter, especially when industrial waste and sewage enters the river system. DO time series can be characteristic of surface water status quality in correspondence to the time series of water temperature. The graph of dissolved oxygen vs. temperature is proposed as a representative graph for overview of surface water quality status. The shapes of the plot concentrations are indicative of different conditions, and useful observations can be made at a glance.

AB  - Timber scarcity relates to the evolution of stocks in both natural forests and tree plantations, relative to the demand from timber processing industries. Several economic indicators are used to evaluate timber scarcity. In particular, the market price of timber stumpage is believed to send a signal to investors in timber growing and to further regulate mill investments, thus preventing industrial overcapacities from emerging relative to future available wood supply. Our analysis of the Indonesian Pulp and Paper industry, one that expanded impressively in the 1990's and installed large overcapacities, gives us the elements to discuss the applicability of market price as a scarcity signal. Specific conditions, usually found in the developing world, most importantly weak or compromised public governance, flawed corporate governance, and the monopsony character of wood supply mechanisms, prevent the development of a market price scarcity signal. In this paper, special attention is paid to the complexity of the wood supply chain and the nature of the actors involved. This, together with the absence of pricing transparency, allows industrial overcapacities to occur, leading to the depletion of the natural forest. A key unresolved mystery here is why the private capital providers made no effort to detect this obvious and critical risk to the repayment capacity of their investments. The apparent absence of any government role in enforcing sustainable harvest or capacity levels results from state capture and governance failure, topics fully discussed elsewhere in the Indonesian case. The situation has implications for supply modeling as well as for public and private policies. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As part of an effort to estimate estuarine habitat values with respect to ecological indicators of benthic macrofaunal community condition, an optimal (effective and least costly) sampling protocol (sample unit size [area X depth], sieve mesh size, and sample number [n]) was determined. The goal was to use four ecological indicators (number of species, abundance, biomass, and fish and crab prey abundance) to detect differences among four intertidal habitats in Willapa Bay, Washington, United States. The four habitats were eelgrass (Zostera marina), Atlantic cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), mud shrimp (Upogebia pugettensis), and ghost shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis). Four sample unit areas (0.005, 0.010, 0.015, and 0.020 m(2)), two sample unit depths (0-5 and 0-10 cm), and two sieve mesh sizes (1.0 and 0.5 mm) were evaluated. The optimal sampling protocol was defined as the least costly protocol capable of reliably (statistical power, 1 - beta greater than or equal to 0.80) detecting significant (alpha = 0.05) differences among greater than or equal to 4 of the 6 pairwise habitat contrasts by ANOVA on all four ecological indicators. The relative cost of each sampling protocol was estimated as a direct function of the sample unit size and number and the cost-in-processing-time ratios of 1 (5 cm deep): 1.7 (10 cm deep) and 1 (greater than or equal to1.0 mm macrofauna size fraction); 2.5 (greater than or equal to0.5 mm macrofauna size fraction), which were taken from previous studies. The optimal sampling protocol was 15-20, 0.01-m(2) x 5-cm deep, 0.5-mm mesh samples per habitat.

AB  - Subfossil chironomid assemblages were used to infer long-term water quality changes in south-central Ontario shield lakes, which are currently being impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication, acid rain, and recent climate change. Using a transfer function developed to infer average end-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (avg VWHO), a 'top-bottom' paleolimnological approach was used to reconstruct pre-industrial (pre-1850) deepwater oxygen conditions. Comparison with present-day ('top' surface sediments) chironomid-based inferences of avgVWHO results suggest that hypolimnetic oxygen levels are presently similar to natural, pre-industrial ('bottom' sediments) levels in most lakes. Approximately half of the study lakes recorded an increase in hypolimnetic oxygen since the 19th century. Inferred changes in avgVWHO correlate well with our results from another chironomid-based oxygen model which reconstructs the Anoxic Factor (AF). When study lakes are separated according to their hydrological status (i.e., natural versus managed), lakes with a dam at their outlet and seasonally managed lake levels had significantly different changes in avgVWHO compared to lakes with natural hydrology. Lakes with a dam at their outlet generally recorded increases in avgVWHO, while natural hydrology lakes mostly recorded declines. There was no relationship between inferred changes in avgVWHO and the density of cottage and resort development along the shorelines of lakes. Changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) possibly related to recent climate changes may also be affecting deepwater oxygen, however patterns of change are very subtle.

AB  - The conditions of 30 blocking events were examined at the time of onset over the 1993/1994-1996/1997 cold season (November to March). The antecedent synoptic-scale eddies in 83.3% of the total events are shown to induce a large-scale low/high eddy forcing pattern upstream of the incipient block, and the mean basic westerly flow is weak, 76.7% of which possesses cyclonic shear. It appears that both the antecedent synoptic-scale eddies that induce a low/high eddy forcing pattern and the weak background westerly flow (zonal wave number 0) that allows quasi-stationary preblock ridge are two necessary preconditions for the onset of blocking anticyclone, but the cyclonic shear of the background westerly flow is a favorable preblock environment. In addition, a theoretical model, represented by the superposition of dipole and monopole envelope Rossby solitons with weak orographic forcing for zonal wave number 2, is proposed to confirm these observations. It is found that the dipole envelope soliton is dominant and exhibits a quasi-2-week oscillation during the interaction between an antecedent blocking anticyclone and upstream synoptic-scale eddies. The monopole soliton tends to break up, indicating that blocking anticyclone circulation is dominated by the amplification of dipole component associated with synoptic-scale eddies. Finally, the evolution of time-dependent eddy feedback is shown to control the direction of planetary-scale potential vorticity transports induced by transient eddies, which is an indicator of the onset, maintenance, and decay of blocking. Moreover, the changes of amplified blocking anticyclone and synoptic-scale eddies obtained theoretically are also in agreement with those of observed blocking and synoptic eddies.

AB  - To analyze the process of oocyte maturation in nemertean worms, oocytes with a large nucleus (=germinal vesicle, or GV) were removed from gravid ovaries of Cerebratulus lacteus and Micrura alaskensis. Following transfer to natural seawater (NSW), fully grown oocytes spontaneously matured as indicated by their completion of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), whereas GVBD was reversibly blocked if the oocytes were initially placed in calcium-free seawater (CaFSW). Similarly, calcium ionophore treatments triggered GVBD in calcium-containing artificial seawater (ASW) but not in CaFSW, suggesting that external calcium influx may facilitate maturation. However, compared to the overall levels of maturation elicited by ASW, significantly higher percentages of GVBD were achieved with NSW or with ASW that had been conditioned with marine sediment. Moreover, calcium channel blockers decreased GVBD rates in ASW but not in NSW, which is consistent with the view that substances other than external calcium ions can trigger maturation. Accordingly, oocytes underwent equally high levels of GVBD when treated with serotonin (=5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) in ASW or CaFSW. The 5-HT-induced maturation was blocked by inhibitors of 5-HT receptors but continued to occur in the presence of calcium channel blockers or the calcium chelator BAPTA. In addition, oocytes microinjected with fluorescent calcium indicators underwent GVBD in response to 5-HT without displaying marked calcium transients during confocal imaging runs. Collectively, such findings suggest that nemertean oocytes can mature via multiple pathways that may include external calcium influx or a 5-HT-induced signaling cascade that lacks prominent calcium fluctuations.

AB  - A white clover model system (consisting of O-3-sensitive [NC-S] and tolerant [NC-R] clones) offers an opportunity to establish cause (temporally dynamic O-3 exposures) and effect (temporally variable, chronic plant biomass responses) relationships under chamberless, ambient conditions on a regional scale. However, our understanding of the performance of the system (ambient O-3 exposures and the responses of NC-S:NC-R) requires improvement. For example, there are residual carry-over effects in the biomass responses of NC-S:NC-R between successive harvests in a given growth season. However, there were no clear increasing or decreasing trends in these ratios from harvest to harvest during a given growth season. Based on observed differential, perhaps random variations in the biomass responses of NC-S:NC-R, one may conclude that growth regulating factors other than the ambient O-3 were responsible for the observed variability. This is supported by the results of the linear regression analysis between the O-3 exposure potentials (O-3 flux) and the biomass responses of NC-S:NGR. Future research must include not only site specific measurements of ambient O-3 concentrations and the biomass responses of NC-S and NC-R, but also hourly horizontal windspeeds, air temperature, global radiation and relative humidity, to derive more realistic and reliable numerical relationships of cause (O-3 fluxes) and effect (NC-S:NC-R biomass). The resulting predictive models need to be of time-series in their nature to account for the stochasticity of the underlying relationships. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. Am rights reserved.

AB  - We review previously published studies on how temperature affects development and reproduction of spiders, with an emphasis on recent studies from China published in Chinese. We apply both linear and non-linear models to data from these papers to examine relationships between temperature and the spider's rate of development, and we estimate the thermal requirements of selected species. Intra-and interspecific variation in development time, survival, adult longevity, adult size, and reproduction are considered, and apparently, phenotypic plasticity in these above life history traits is induced by growth temperature. With respect to the life histories and life style of the spider species we argue that the thermal adaptations of spiders might have important roles in fine-tuning the species' life-history strategies: much of this variability is probably a consequence of adaptations to the different thermal conditions prevailing in the natural habitats of these species. Spiders living in warmer climates can withstand higher temperatures than species from colder climates, and species from colder climates can tolerate lower temperatures than species from warmer climates. Cold-habitat species develop more slowly at high temperatures, and warm-habitat species develop more slowly at low temperatures. Also, different species of spiders show different seasonal adaptations to the microenvironments in which they live: fast, low-temperature development is an indicator of adaptation to colder season(s) of the year, whereas slow, low-temperature development and fast, high-temperature development are indicators of adaptation to warm season(s) of the year.

AB  - To determine some of the environmental effects that influence the relative proportions of pigments in algae, high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis was employed to determine the relative amounts of common photosynthetic pigments in batch cultures of the diatoms, Fragilaria crotonensis and Thalassiosira pseudonana, and the green algae, Scenedesmus abundans, and Haematococcus pluvialis, illuminated for 12 hours each day. Similar analyses were conducted in five-day experiments during which cultures of F. crotonensis and S. quadricauda were kept in continuous darkness. Comparing the results to those for controls continuing to receive the daily illumination indicated that the diatoms and green algae react similarly to light deficiency The relative amounts of the main accessory pigment in the diatoms, fucoxanthin, and that in the green alga, apparently lutein, decreased as a reaction to a lack of illumination, while the total chlorophyll level in algae of both groups remained nearly constant. Quantitative differences induced by the experimental conditions were considerably less that those observed among different species of diatom or among the different green algae, however. Finally, cultures of S. quadricauda were analyzed and then kept for 43 days without the addition of any nutrients. A proportion of the culture was kept for this period in perpetual darkness while another continued to receive 12 hours of illumination. The results show that considerable changes occur as the cultures age, and that these changes occur more slowly in the darkness. Some consequences of these findings for phytoplankton production studies based on analyses of photosynthetic pigments are discussed.

AB  - This paper discusses the derivation of Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines for cadmium and the potential uses of guidelines.  The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) has established science-based protocols for developing national environmental quality guidelines (numerical concentration limits) for contaminants in water, sediment, tissue, and soil (for soils the term ''criteria'' is used instead of guidelines).  These published protocols not only allow for the use of standardized approaches to derive guidelines, but also facilitate the meaningful synthesis and critique of the available scientific data for specific contaminants.  Many data gaps concerning fate, exposure and effects of contaminants exist (e.g. factors affecting speciation and bioavailability of metals in the environment).  However, these protocols allows for guideline development while identifying the priority recommendations for research and monitoring.  The primary goal of these guidelines is to protect designated uses of environmental media (e.g. water for irrigation) or directly protect organisms from specific contaminants.  Canadian environmental provide basic scientific information about the effects of water quality variables on water uses.  This information can then be used to establish environmental quality objectives at specific sites.  Environmental quality objectives are derived in the same way as guidelines, except the only species and environmental conditions relevant to the specific site are considered.  The objectives may then be used as benchmarks for the assessment of environmental quality at the specific site.  The derivation of guidelines for cadmium was based upon currently available information concerning environmental fate, behaviour and toxicity of cadmium (Cd).  For example, a draft guideline of 0.017 mug Cd.L1 for the protection  of freshwater life was derived incorporating the influence of hardness on metal toxicity.

TI  - A SUSTAINABILITY INDICATOR FOR THE DUTCH ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY THEME DIFFUSION - CADMIUM ACCUMULATION IN SOIL
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA  - English
KW  - CADMIUM
KW  - SUSTAINABILITY INDICATOR
AB  - Dutch initiatives into the development of indicators for sustainable development received a major impetus with a workshop held in 1989. Subsequent work has focused on the development of such indicators within environmental policy themes. This paper reports on the development of an indicator within the environmental policy theme 'diffusion' - the movement of toxic micropollutants into and throughout the environment. This theme presents a challenge to indicator development because of the myriad substances (including heavy metals, PCBs, pesticides and their residues, radiation) and behaviours on release. Consequently, a case study was undertaken in which consideration was limited to cadmium accumulation in soil.
   Development of a sustainability indicator required specification of the sustainability context and associated criteria. We propose two criteria, both of which must be satisfied for sustainability: (1) additions of cadmium to the soil from all sources (atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use and sewage sludge disposal) should not exceed losses from the soil due to leaching, runoff and uptake by crops; and (2) the total volume or concentration of cadmium in the soil should not exceed soil quality standards.
   A pictorial presentation for the indicator, known as a 'state space', is proposed in which the two criteria define the axes of a graph. The format offers implications for policy, particularly the urgency of implementation and the severity of measures. As with most indicators, more information is conveyed with time series. Output from a dynamic materials balance is used to generate such a time series. Via these development trajectories and alternative scenarios reflected by the dynamic materials balance, policies can be assessed by their capacity to move the system towards more sustainable conditions.

AB  - In this paper, a novel two-stage structural damage detection method using modal flexibility and strain energy-based index (MFSEBI) and modified teaching-learning-based optimization (MTLBO) algorithm is proposed. In the first stage, a novel damage index (MFSEBI) is proposed based on the combination of two structural modal properties including modal strain energy of elements and diagonal members of the structural flexibility matrix to identify the suspected damaged elements. The performance of this indicator is compared to the performance of an indicator derived from the modal strain energy. As the change in the structural modal properties is also affected by environmental variations, in this study, the effect of varying environmental conditions on the performance of the MFSEBI is also examined. In the second stage, the modal response of the structure is used and subsequently updated by MTLBO to estimate the damage extents of the suspected elements. At this stage, the MTLBO algorithm is proposed by enhancing the teaching and learning quality of the TLBO algorithm using new updating mechanisms of each learner position. The performance of the MTLBO and TLBO algorithms is compared in terms of the accuracy of the results and convergence rate. The results of three numerical examples indicate a better performance of the MFSEBI index in damage localization using a smaller number of mode shapes. These results also demonstrate the higher accuracy of the estimated damage extents and the faster convergence rate of the objective function using MTLBO, even with the consideration of measurement noise effects.

AB  - The UN Sustainable Development Goals have set clear targets on global poverty, hunger and malnutrition to be achieved by 2030, which have prompted academics and policymakers to identify useful strategies and drivers. Moreover, the COVID19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities at national and sub-national levels thus hampering the achievement of these goals. On considering the multifaceted nature of poverty, a recent research strand focuses on food poverty and insecurity issues in terms of economic access to food and healthy diet consumption, with moderate and extreme food insecurity affecting almost 9% of the population in Europe and North America. This paper aims to analyse food poverty and insecurity at regional level in Italy. Using micro-data from the Italian Household Budget Survey carried out by ISTAT, an analytical approach was proposed to define and measure the different degree of food poverty and insecurity. Moreover, to obtain insights into whether food poverty and insecurity can afford population healthy nutrition, inequality of the distributions of food expenditure categories are estimated. The results provided us with information on other important aspects of the poverty. Indeed, in Italy individuals who are at-risk-of-food-poverty or food insecure amount to 22.3% of the entire population. Furthermore, the at-risk-of-food-poverty-rate varies at regional level from 14.6% (Umbria) to 29.6% (Abruzzo), with high levels of food consumption inequalities observed above all for vegetables, meat and fish. All these issues could help policy makers to define economic intervention policies aimed at reducing social exclusion and achieving more equitable and sustainable living conditions for the entire population.

AB  - Background: aging is a process characterized by the progressive loss of physical, cognitive, biological and psychosocial capacities. Specific physical exercise programs for older people stimulate balance, strength, and gait and protect against falls and their effects. Physical activity favors the maintenance of functional independence in older adults.
   Objective: to determine the effect of a physical exercise program to increase lower extremity strength in older adults.
   Methods: a study was carried out that corresponded to a pre-experimental design, with pre and post-test and a control group. The sample n=30, age=72.3 and standard deviation S=7.0. The tests were applied: Get up and walk, Steps on and over a 15.2 cm step. Statistically, a descriptive analysis of data and comparison was carried out, according to the distribution of frequencies and percentages of strength indicators; correlation and independence between variables were determined: strength, sex, age and illnesses, using Pearson's Chi-square correlation statistics, Pearson's R and Spearman's Correlation. Chi-square of Pearson, Gamma and Tau-b of Kendall were applied, with normality in the data distribution and confidence p=0.05, through the statistical program IBM SPSS for Windows version 21.0.
   Results: significant changes were shown in the strength of the lower limbs of older adults and no dependence between the related sociodemographic variables, p>0.05, except in the relationship between conditions and the Get up and walk test p<0.05, which showed dependence between lower extremity strength and cardiovascular disease.
   Conclusions: the program increases the strength in the lower limbs of older adults, with a dependency relationship between the strength of the lower limbs and cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Like most northern rivers, the Vychegda River, the second largest water system in the Komi Republic and the main tributary of the Northern Dvina River, has experienced an intense anthropogenic load. Agricultural, domestic, and, to a greater extent, industrial wastewaters are currently the main polluting sources of river waters. Among the numerous enterprises operating here is Mondi Syktyvkar JSC, the largest pulp and paper enterprise in Russia, which is located on the Vychegda River banks. The composition and structure of the zooplankton communities were studied in the Vychegda River area, where the effect of wastewaters from the pulp and paper plant is observed. The aim of the research is to determine whether there is a negative impact of the conditionally treated wastewaters on the aquatic biota. As a result, a rich species composition and the quantitative development of zooplankton communities were established for the studied river area. Rotifera was the dominant group on the species richness, abundance, and biomass. This is a characteristic feature of zooplankton communities in the watercourse as a whole. The indicator species of waters with a high level of pollution were registered both at points located in the area of wastewater influence and on the background river plots. Species that are not typical to the natural waters of the river were found at points of wastewater discharge. The dominant complexes are represented by 9-15 or more species. Their composition differs in background, wastewater and downstream points. According to the state of zooplankton communities, the river waters in the studied area are conditionally clean, except for points located downstream of the wastewater discharge, where they are qualified as eutrophic.

AB  - This investigation was conducted to identify the content of metals in Calluna vulgaris (family Ericaceae), Empetrum nigrum (family Ericaceae), Festuca vivipara (family Poaceae) and Thymus praecox subsp. arcticus (family Lamiaceae), as well as in the soils where they were growing in eight geothermal heathlands in Iceland. Investigation into the vegetation of geothermal areas is crucial and may contribute to their proper protection in the future and bring more understanding under what conditions the plants respond to an ecologically more extreme situation. Plants from geothermally active sites were enriched with metals as compared to the same species from non-geothermal control sites (at an average from about 150 m from geothermal activity). The enriched metals consisted of Cd, Co, Cu, Fe and Ni in C. vulgaris; Cd, Mn and Ti in E. nigrum; Hg and Pb in F. vivipara; and Cd, Fe and Hg in T. praecox. Notably, C. vulgaris, E. nigrum, F. vivipara and T. praecox had remarkably high concentrations of Ti at levels typical of toxicity thresholds. Cd and Pb (except for C. vulgaris and F. vivipara) were not accumulated in the shoots of geothermal plants. C. vulgaris from geothermal and control sites was characterised by the highest bioaccumulation factor (BF) of Ti and Mn; E. nigrum and F. vivipara by the highest BF of Ti and Cr; and T. praecox by the highest BF of Ti and Zn compared to the other elements. In comparison with the other examined species, F. vivipara from geothermal sites had the highest concentration of Ti in above-ground parts at any concentration of plant-available Ti in soil.

AB  - It is urgent and important to explore the regional differences and dynamic evolution of urban land green use efficiency (ULGUE) in the context of green development. The SBM-Undesirable model was used in this study alongside coefficient of variation and kernel density estimation to analyze the spatial-temporal pattern and dynamic evolution of ULGUE in 25 cities across the Yangtze River Delta, China from 2004 to 2015. Carbon emissions resulting from the urban construction land and happiness index were placed into the ULGUE evaluation index framework. In terms of regional differences, ULGUE in the Yangtze River Delta appears to have trended upward from 2004 to 2015. The undesired output indicators representing average ULGUE were 0.7131 and 0.7323, respectively, while the average values not including the undesired output indicators were 0.7612 and 0.8578. The Yangtze River Delta can be divided into advantaged, flat, and disadvantaged areas. Seven cities belong to the advantaged areas, fourteen cities to the flat areas, and four cities to the disadvantaged areas. The ULGUE of the whole and different types of urban areas in the Yangtze River Delta shows a highly skewed distribution and different degrees of polarization with time. Policy-wise, it is essential to completely consider the country?s resources and environmental conditions, especially in inter-city, urban, and rural-to build a beautiful China and to contribute meaningfully to the protection of the global eco-environment and food security.

AB  - Main conclusion Short-term cold stress can induce the increased expression of key enzyme-encoding genes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis, thereby increasing secondary metabolite concentration. Cold stress is an ecologically limiting factor that strongly affects the physiological and biochemical properties of medicinal plants often resulting in changes of the secondary metabolic process. Ginsenosides are the main active ingredients in medicinal ginseng yet few studies exist on the effect of cold stress on the expression of ginsenosides or the molecular mechanism underlying its regulation. Here, we evaluated the effects of cold stress on the physiological characteristics and secondary metabolism of P. ginseng embryogenic calli. Physiological measurements and RNA-Seq analysis were used to dissect the metabolic and molecular responses of P. ginseng to cold conditions. We found that the dynamic accumulation of ginsenoside and various physiological indicators leads to homogenous adaptation to cold stress. Secondary metabolism of ginseng could be a compensation mechanism to facilitate its adaptation to cold stress. Combined with the changes in the endogenous hormone content, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), and short chain dehydrogenase (SDR) from the abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis pathway were identified as key mediators of this response. Thus, an appropriate degree of cold stress may promote accumulation of ginsenosides. Moreover, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR2), squalene epoxidase (SE1), squalene synthase (SS), dammarenediol synthase (DS-II), and beta-alanine C-28 hydroxylase (CYP716A52v2) should be considered key mediators of the cold stress response and ginsenoside biosynthesis. During industrial production, short-term cold stress should be carried out on ginseng calli to improve the quality of its medicinal materials.

AB  - Water quality was highly affected by common pollutants. Metals, pesticides and small molecules are ubiquitous pollutants. Advancement in engineering technology (computer-based monitoring systems) increased the efficiency of quantifying toxicity of different chemicals in an organism. The cardiovascular system reflects internal and external stress of an organism, and electrocardiogram (ECG) data reliably measure external stress. As ECG data can accurately reflect the physiological conditions of organisms, and zebrafish (Danio rerio) are considered to be good models for cardiovascular research, it is hypothesized that ECG parameters of zebrafish could indicate the toxicity of water-borne chemicals. To achieve this, we treated zebrafish with different concentrations of target chemicals (CuSO4, C10H19O6PS2 and NH4Cl) for 48 h and ECG data were measured. P-wave, R-wave, T-wave, PR-interval, QRS-complex and QT-interval data were the focus of this study. The results of self-organizing maps and Pearson correlation analysis indicate that the QRS-complex can be used as an indicator for CuSO4 stress. The QT-interval could be used to assess the C10H19O6PS2 stress. The QT-interval and P-wave can be used to evaluate the NH4Cl stress. Responses of zebrafish ECG parameters were identical with other vertebrate model, and were specific to toxicant types. It is proved that zebrafish heart ECG index could be used as a potential indicator in early detection of environmental stress. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many vocalizing animals produce the discrete elements of their acoustic signals in a specific sequential order, but we know little about the biological relevance of this ordering. For that, we must characterize the degree by which individuals differ in how they organize their signals sequentially and relate these differences to variation in quality and fitness. In this study, we fulfilled these tasks in male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We characterized the sequential order of syllables with a network analysis approach and studied the consistency of network variables on distinct time scales (within day, between days, and between years), and assessed their relationship with such quality indicators like age, body condition, arrival date, and fitness related proxies like survival to the next year and pairing success. We found that the syllables were associated nonrandomly with one another and both the frequency differences of consecutive syllables and the number of motif types were higher in the original than in randomized syllable sequences. Average degree and small-worldness showed considerable among-individual differences and decreasing repeatability with increasing time scale. Furthermore, we found relationships between male age and average degree among and within individuals. Accordingly, older males produce syllable sequences by using common syllables less often than younger individuals. However, the network variables showed no relationship with fitness-related variables. In conclusion, the sequential organization of birdsong has the potential to encode individual-specific characteristics, which thus could be used as signal in social interactions and thus potentially could be subject to sexual selection.

AB  - Chronic tinnitus, the perception of a phantom sound in the absence of corresponding stimulus, is a condition known to affect patients' quality of life. Recent advances in mHealth have enabled patients to maintain a 'disease journal' of ecologically-valid momentary assessments, improving patients' own awareness of their disease while also providing clinicians valuable data for research. In this study, we investigate the effect of non-personalised tips on patients' perception of tinnitus, and on their continued use of the application. The data collected from the study involved three groups of patients that used the app for 16 weeks. Groups A & Y were exposed to feedback from the start of the study, while group B only received tips for the second half of the study. Groups A and Y were run by different supervisors and also differed in the number of hospital visits during the study. Users of Group A and B underwent assessment at baseline, mid-study, post-study and follow-up, while users of group Y were only assessed at baseline and post-study. It is seen that the users in group B use the app for longer, and also more often during the day. The answers of the users to the Ecological Momentary Assessments are seen to form clusters where the degree to which the tinnitus distress depends on tinnitus loudness varies. Additionally, cluster-level models were able to predict new unseen data with better accuracy than a single global model. This strengthens the argument that the discovered clusters really do reflect underlying patterns in disease expression.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of the management system on soil quality, chemical and biological properties were measured in soils (0-20 cm depth) from Japanese plum orchards managed under organic and conventional conditions. The experiment was conducted between 2005 and 2014 in orchards established at the agricultural research station at Alcala del Rio, Seville, Spain. Overall, the soil chemical parameters in the organic orchard showed higher concentrations of soil organic matter, total N, available P and Mg. There was a trend of higher concentrations of K and Na, though for these elements the differences were significant only in two and one years, respectively. Similarly, concentrations of Mn and Zn tended to be higher in the organic plots, whereas contradictory trends were shown for Fe and Cu. No differences were found between the treatments for other physicochemical parameters such as pH and electrical conductivity. Regarding soil biological properties, the organic system was characterised with a significantly greater abundance of bacteria and fungi compared with the conventional system. The rhizobia population and the legume biomass were also higher in the organic orchard and the plants had more nodules. Likewise, the number of earthworms was higher in the organic system. The results showed that long-term organic management, including the use of cover crops and compost, resulted in a significant shift of the chemical and biological characteristics of the soil compared with the conventional management practice, thus improving soil quality and suggesting that organic farming may provide a potential solution to achieve sustainable agricultural systems.

AB  - Strigais an important biotic factor limiting maize production in sub-Saharan Africa and can cause yield losses as high as 100%. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) approaches hold a great potential for improvingStrigaresistance but requires identification and use of markers associated withStrigaresistance for adequate genetic gains from selection. However, there is no report on the discovery of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance toStrigain maize under artificial field infestation. In the present study, 198 BC(1)S(1)families obtained from a cross involving TZEEI 29 (Strigaresistant inbred line) and TZEEI 23 (Strigasusceptible inbred line) plus the two parental lines were screened under artificialStriga-infested conditions at twoStriga-endemic locations in Nigeria in 2018, to identify QTL associated withStrigaresistance indicator traits, including grain yield, ears per plant,Strigadamage and number of emergedStrigaplants. Genetic map was constructed using 1,386 DArTseq markers distributed across the 10 maize chromosomes, covering 2076 cM of the total genome with a mean spacing of 0.11 cM between the markers. Using composite interval mapping (CIM), fourteen QTL were identified for keyStrigaresistance/tolerance indicator traits: 3 QTL for grain yield, 4 for ears per plant and 7 forStrigadamage at 10 weeks after planting (WAP), across environments. Putative candidate genes which encode major transcription factor families WRKY, bHLH, AP2-EREBPs, MYB, and bZIP involved in plant defense signaling were detected forStrigaresistance/tolerance indicator traits. The QTL detected in the present study would be useful for rapid transfer ofStrigaresistance/tolerance genes intoStrigasusceptible but high yielding maize genotypes using MAS approaches after validation. Further studies on validation of the QTL in different genetic backgrounds and in different environments would help verify their reproducibility and effective use in breeding forStrigaresistance/tolerance.

AB  - Curcumin exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. We investigated the protective effects of curcumin in a renal injury rat model under dry-heat conditions. We divided Sprague-Dawley rats into four groups: dry-heat 0- (normal temperature control group), 50-, 100-, and 150-minute groups. Each group was divided into five subgroups (n = 10): normal saline (NS), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMCNa), and curcumin pretreated low, medium, and high-dose (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively) groups. Compared to the normal temperature group, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urinary kidney injury molecule-1, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated load changes in lipoprotein (NGAL) levels were significantly increased in the dry-heat environment group (P < .05); inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and malondialdehyde (MDA) and related inflammatory factor levels were increased in the kidney tissue. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels were decreased. However, following all curcumin pretreatment, the serum levels of kidney injury indicators and NGAL were decreased in the urine compared to those in the NS and CMCNa groups (P < .05), whereas renal SOD and CAT activities were increased and MDA was decreased (P < .05). Renal tissues of the 150-minute group showed obvious pathological changes. Compared to the NS group, pathological changes in the renal tissues of the 100- and 200-mg/kg curcumin groups were significantly reduced. Furthermore, iNOS and COX-2 expression and inflammatory factor levels were decreased after curcumin treatment. Curcumin exerted renoprotective effects that were likely mediated by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in a dry-heat environment rat model.

AB  - Deep soils contain more organic carbon than surface soils, and deep organic carbon has a longer carbon mean residence time. Relatively little is known about the degradation of organic matter in deep soils, especially over millennial time scales. Tephra (volcanic ash) deposition occasionally buries surface soils and forms deep soils rich in organic matter. In order to investigate the alteration and dynamics of buried organic matter in deep soils, we characterized common biochemicals, combined amino acids and amino sugars, in tephra layers deposited over millennial timescales in Hokkaido, Japan. Chemical analyses indicated relative abundances of specific amino acids (e.g. leucine and phenylalanine) and amino sugars, (e.g. glucosamine and galactosamine) changed with tephra soil age, indicating microbial alterations over millennial time scales. The observed changes in chemical composition were much slower than those typically observed during litter decomposition. Adsorption characteristics of the tephras developed with weathering and contributed to substantial organic carbon accumulation in the deep, aged tephra layers, such as Ta-c (deposited 1640 yr BP) and Ta-d (deposited 8940 yr BP). These observations indicate rapid microbial degradation and alteration during early stages of litter decomposition followed by much slower degradation following burial, when physicochemical processes such as sorption and occlusion and changes in environmental conditions influence organic matter accumulation and composition. Thus, microbial processes during organic matter decomposition and physicochemical processes during tephra diagenesis shape the chemical characteristics, reactivity and age of organic matter in buried tephra soils.

AB  - This study aims to provide accurate information about changes in agricultural systems (AS) using phenological metrics derived from the NDVI time series. Use of such information could help land managers optimize land use choices and monitor the status of agricultural lands, under a variety of environmental and socioeconomic conditions. For this purpose, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data were used to derive phenological metrics over the Oum Er-Rbia basin (central Morocco). Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers were explored and compared on their ability to classify AS classes over the study area. Four main AS classes have been considered: (1) irrigated annual crop (IAC), (2) irrigated perennial crop (IPC), (3) rainfed area (RA), and (4) fallow (FA). By comparing the accuracy of the three classifiers, the RF method showed the best performance with an overall accuracy of 0.97 and kappa coefficient of 0.96. The RF method was then chosen to examine time variations in AS over a 16-year period (2000-2016). The AS main variations were detected and evaluated for the four AS classes. These variations have been found to be linked well with other indicators of local agricultural land management, as well as the historical agricultural drought changes over the study area. Overall, the results present a tool for decision makers to improve agricultural management and provide a different perspective in understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of agricultural systems.

AB  - Urbanization's rapid progress presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of "the death and life of cities" (a.k.a. "the essential diversity conditions for the urban built environment"). Despite the importance of activity diversity (i.e. serving different primary functions), existing works ignored that time diversity (i.e. attracting people at different times of the day) and space diversity (i.e. attracting people from different districts) also play important roles in promoting urban life in large cities. With assistance of human mobility and crowdsourcing data, this article thoroughly validates whether activity, time, and space diversity are essential and inseparable components of urban vitality in the Wuhan, China context. To achieve the goal, point of interest (POI) data are utilized to quantitatively measure activity diversity, human mobility data are adopted for building quantitative metrics of time diversity and space diversity, and a detailed urban perception map is crowdsourced as ground truth data for establishing a regression model between urban diversity indicators and urban vitality. The resultant regression model succeeds to decouple the relationship between population concentration, activity diversity, time diversity, space diversity, and urban vitality. It confirms that activity diversity together with time diversity and space diversity has stronger association with urban vitality than any single diversity indicator. Our contributions are threefold: (a) we provided a comprehensive collection of metrics for measuring urban diversity, (b) we confirmed that activity, time, and space diversity are essential components of urban vitality, and (3) our methodology can be replicated at scale to understand urban vitality under various geographic, societal, and economic contexts due to easy accessibility of similar datasets.

AB  - A long-term perspective is essential for understanding environmental change. To be able to access the past, environmental archives such as marine and lake sediments that store information in the form of diverse proxy records are used. Whilst many analytical techniques exist to extract the information stored in these proxy records, the critical assessment and refinement of current methods in addition to developing new methods is crucial to improving our understanding. This study aims to improve our knowledge on diatom species used for reconstructing ocean surface conditions, especially temperature and sea ice variability over time. We define the distribution and the relationship to sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentrations (SIC) of the species Fragilariopsis oceanica, Fragilariopsis reginae-jahniae and Fossula arctica using diatom training sets from the northern North Atlantic. We further assess the effect of separating these species compared to grouping them under F. oceanica, as has been done in the past. Our results suggest that while these three species share similarities such as the preference for stratified waters induced by sea ice or glacier meltwater, they also exhibit heterogeneous distributions across the northern North Atlantic, with individual optima for SST and SIC. This also affects quantitative reconstructions based on our data, resulting in lower SST and higher SIC estimates when the species are separated in the surface sediment and down-core diatom assemblages.

AB  - Although a high concentration of some 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines in green coffee has been associated with an off-flavor described as potato taste defect (PTD) or "peasy" defect, affecting the product quality, the natural concentration of these compounds in good quality coffee beans has never been the subject of a detailed study. 3-Isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (1), 3-sec-butyl-2-methoxypyrazine (2), 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine (3) concentrations were determined on a range of selected, good quality green coffees of different botanical species (arabica and robusta) and geographical origin. The presence of the three methoxypirazines was confirmed in all samples; the concentration of compound 1 was significantly higher than those of compounds 3 and 2, showing a geographical-origin-dependent variability. This whole set of experimental data was then used as a reference to ascertain the PTD occurrence in "suspected PTD" and insect-damaged samples. Compound 3 was the main indicator of defectiveness, with a main variability in its concentration in insect-damaged samples, suggesting that the insect-induced damage is not a sufficient condition to induce the off-flavor. The analysis in fresh potatoes, carried out to disclose the origin of the term used to describe the PTD in coffee, showed a very low concentration of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines. However, the relative prevalence of compound 3 on the total of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines could be related to the characteristic "potato" flavor frequently evoked to describe the sensory perceived defect in coffee.

AB  - The complexity of historic centres implies that risk assessment in those areas should be based on joint analyses of the characteristics of the built environment and the population's features, exposure and interaction with the surrounding environment. Such a holistic approach is urgently needed to evaluate the impact of mitigation strategies, especially in sudden onset disasters, and, mainly, earthquakes. In fact, the effectiveness of retrofitting interventions and emergency management strategies on the safety level depends greatly on such interactions, also in relation to the path network features. This work proposes a PDCA-based methodology for earthquake risk assessment which innovatively combines built environment damage assessment with a simulation of human evacuation behaviour so as to identify potentially inaccessible evacuation paths and urban areas, define related paths/areas safety levels and evaluate the impact of proposed retrofitting and management strategies on the population's safety in an emergency. To this end, a validated seismic vulnerability index method for masonry facade walls is combined with empirical damage assessment correlations (debris depth estimation in outdoor spaces) to create post-earthquake damage scenarios. Then, these are used as input data for evacuation process assessment through an existing earthquake pedestrians' evacuation simulator. Paths and safe areas risk indices are proposed to evaluate the main behavioural issues in emergency conditions. Finally, different solutions aimed at improving evacuation safety (i.e. emergency plans, rescuers' access strategies and retrofitting of buildings) are proposed and discussed for a significant case study, the historic centre of Coimbra, Portugal.

AB  - Changing climatic conditions and the northward expansion of ticks and pathogens are of immense importance to human, animal, and environmental health assessment and risk management. From 2014 through 2015, a wildlife rehabilitation center in south-central Arizona, US noted soft ticks (Argasidae) infesting 23 birds, including Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii), Gray Hawks (Buteo plagiatus), Harris's Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus), Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), Common Ravens (Corvus corax), and a Greater Roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), during the late summer seasonal rainy seasons. The parasites numbered in the hundreds on individual birds. Infested birds were moribund, obtunded, or paralyzed on presentation, with no prior histories of illness or evidence of trauma. Tick and avian blood samples were collected for vector-borne pathogen analysis focusing on the molecular detection of Rickettsia and Borrelia species. Ticks were identified as the neotropical species of soft tick, Argas (Persicargas) giganteus; their occurrence in the southern US on raptors represented an expansion of host range. Pathogen testing of ticks showed that 41% of 54 ticks were infected with Rickettsia hoogstraalii and 23% of 26 ticks were infected with a relapsing fever Borrelia; both agents are associated with uncertain health consequences. Among the blood samples, one was infected with the same Borrelia spp.; this Red-tailed Hawk also had Borrelia-positive ticks. With supportive therapy, the majority of birds, 74% (17/23), recovered and were released or permanent residents. The management of soft tick-infested birds and mitigation of future disease risk will require additional characterizations of these poorly studied soft ticks and their associated pathogens.

AB  - A literature review of the evaluation issues of existed methods and standards regulating the surface waters quality from the scientific and applied points of view is given. The problem of an objective and reliable assessment of the level of influence of anthropogenic factors on the quality of water resources has special relevance in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). According to the number of leading scientists, mainly from the Russian Federation (RF), one of the significant insufficiency in the assessing of surface waters quality is the applying of uniform values of maximum permissible concentration (MPC) MPCsh and MPCfish established for the entire territory of the former USSR without taking into account the specifics of regional natural conditions and characteristics of water bodies. Within the territory of Kazakhstan the distortion of the actual state of surface water quality is becoming due to the use of the natural concentrations of the main ions and heavy metals in the calculation of the complex water pollution index (CWPI) by the Kazhydromet and not taking into account the wide distribution in the water bodies with brackish waters and ore-bearing areas. The validity of these statements is confirmed by examples from official publications.
   According to a common opinion of scientists, it is necessary to proceed the development of regional MPC because some methodological approaches have already appeared. It is recommended to develop a Temporary Methodological Guide for Surface Water Quality Assessment (prior to the establishment of regional water quality indicators) in Kazakhstan, excluding the main water ions from the calculated CWPI indicators, because they are not pollutants but natural components of the water composition.

AB  - Functional upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) can offer new possibilities in fluorescent applications as they exhibit desired characteristic properties like large shift between the fluorescent emission signal and the infrared excitation wavelength, multi-and narrow-band absorption and emission in visible and near infrared - Vis/NIR, together with excellent photostability and low toxicity as opposed to semiconducting quantum dots. The upconversion luminescence emission or quenching characteristics of UCNPs can be altered upon exposure to physical or chemical environmental factors providing thus a functionality that can be utilized for sensing or imaging. Furthermore their functionalization with suitable indicator dyes or recognition elements can extend the range of luminescence response and ratiometric sensing to specific analytes. Synergistically, electrospun nano- and microfibers offering large surface area can enhance the functionality of UCNPs by retaining the fluorescence efficiency and improving the overall responsivity due to dramatically increased surface. For the optimization of this hybrid material system the controllable incorporation of UCNPs is required especially at increased concentration conditions needed for high brightness. Herein, we report the fabrication, morphological and optical characterization of electrospun polymer-based nanocomposite fibers, consisting of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and upconverting lanthanide doped nanoparticles of the type NaYF4 : 20% Yb3+/2% Er3+@ NaYF4. Morphological studies regarding the uniformity and aggregation effects of the UCNP inclusion within the fibers have been implemented followed by upconversion emission characterization by pulsed near-infrared excitation. The study and optimization of such nanocomposite fibrous systems could provide useful insights for the development of efficient upconverting electrospun fiber mats for a number of imaging and sensing applications.

AB  - Larval fish suffer dramatic mortality in the days following transition to autonomous feeding, with over 90% of larvae being eliminated within a period of few weeks. Recent work has shown that the hydrodynamic environment experienced by recently-hatched larvae impedes their feeding rates even under high prey densities. Here, we quantified starvation through early ontogeny in Sparus aurata larvae (8-18 days post-hatching; DPH) and tested whether the emerging ontogenetic pattern is consistent with that expected one based on the hydrodynamic environment that these larvae experience. We screened three candidate genes agrp1, npy, and hsp70, whose expression was previously shown to respond to starvation in fish. Of the three genes, agrp1 was identified as a suitable indicator for starvation. Localization of agrp1 mRNA by whole-mount in-situ hybridization confirmed that, in S. aurata larvae, agrp1 is expressed only in the hypothalamus. Quantification of agrp1 mRNA using real-time PCR revealed that the expression of this gene is elevated in starved compared to fed larvae, and in younger (8 DPH) compared to older larvae (18 DPH). Manipulating the water viscosity to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions during the onset of the critical period led to increased agrp1 expression. These findings suggest that the hydrodynamic constraints on larval feeding lead to the starvation of small larvae. Further, they provide a mechanistic explanation for the "safe harbor" hypothesis, which postulates that larvae should allocate resources toward rapid linear growth to escape detrimental effects of dwelling in an environment where viscous fluid forces dominate.

AB  - In this paper we identify changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) intensity during the late Holocene as revealed by palaeohydrological proxies in the fluvial archives of western India. Proxy indices, including the geomorphological, sedimentological, geochemical and biological evidence along with chronology have been employed to highlight the trend in ISM intensity over the late Holocene. It is inferred that on a longer timescale, the Indian Summer Monsoon weakened during the late Holocene however; short pulses of ameliorated monsoon occurred around 3, 1.6 and 0.3 cal ka BP. Clustering of flood events is seen to occur at 3-2.8, 2.2-1.6, 1.3-1.1 and 0.65-0.2 cal ka BP not necessarily coinciding with strengthening of the ISM. Palaeoflood data with regard to the ISM variability shows that the two most prevalent flood events at 0.5 and 1.7 cal ka BP coincide with the weak monsoon period/climatic transition in this region. The occurrence of high magnitude flood events during weak monsoon periods is also reflected in the modern flood and rainfall data. It is surmised that high magnitude flood events may represent peak monsoon periods however, cannot be singularly considered as indicators for enhanced monsoon conditions in a region. Only a more robust database of palaeohydrological proxies can further validate their implications on the monsoonal changes over western India. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - This high-resolution study (210 samples/44 m) of the uppermost Campanian-lower Maastrichtian chalk at Kronsmoor (northern Germany) intends to define the inorganic depositional setting of Late Cretaceous chalk deposition as well as to reconstruct contemporaneous sea-level fluctuations and palae-oenvironmental changes. A latest Campanian event associated with significantly decreased carbonate contents and palaeotemperatures is reflected in most geochemical palaeoproductivity proxies and indicates reduced marine fertility across the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary. Sr/Ca and delta C-13 remain low afterwards while other productivity proxies show a significant rebound, indicating recovery and a potential qualitative change in marine productivity during the early Maastrichtian. Redox-sensitive proxies indicate overall well oxygenated conditions. The %terrigenous proxy tracks an argillaceous chalk depositional event related to an inferred glacio-eustatic latest Campanian sea-level fall followed by a low sea-level stand until the earliest Maastrichtian. It decreases and stays low up-section, reflecting an early Maastrichtian sea-level rise and highstand, parallelled by increasing and consistently high carbonate contents. However, the concomitant conspicuous variability and increase in other terrigenous input proxies indicate more strongly fluctuating and higher aeolian supply. Time-series analysis of selected geochemical proxies demonstrates the presence of the obliquity (similar to 40 kyr) the long-eccentricity (similar to 400 kyr) cycles of the Milankovitch Band. The covariance of productivity proxies and indicators of aeolian input suggests that obliquity forcing of dust input exerted control on (surface) water productivity, CaCO3 flux and the end -Cretaceous carbon cycle.

AB  - Ten coal seams in Upper Shihezi Formation, Lower Shihezi Formation, and Shanxi Formation from the Zhuji mine, Huainan coalfield, China, were analyzed for n-alkanes and isoprenoids (pristine and phytane) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with an aim of reconstructing the coal-forming plants and depositional environments along with organic carbon isotope analyses. The total n-alkane concentrations ranged from 34.1 to 481 mg/kg. Values of organic carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)) ranged from -24.6 to -23.7 parts per thousand. The calorific value (Q(b,d)), maximum vitrinite reflectance (Ro(max)), proximate, and ultimate analysis were also determined but showed no correlation with n-alkane concentrations. Carbon Preference Index (CPI) values ranged from 0.945 to 1.30, suggesting no obvious odd/even predominance of n-alkane. The predominance of C-11 and C-17 n-alkanes implied that the coal may be deposited in the fresh and mildly brackish environment. According to the contrary changing trend of pristine/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratio and boron concentrations, Pr/Ph can be used as an indicator to reconstruct the marine transgression-regression in sedimentary environment of coal formation. The influence of marine transgression may lead to the enrichment of pyrite sulfur in the coal seam 4-2. C3 plants (-32 to -21 parts per thousand) and marine algae (-23 to -16 parts per thousand) were probably the main coal-forming plants in the studied coal seams. No correlation of the n-alkane concentration and redox condition of the depositional environment with organic carbon isotope composition were found.

AB  - Formal integration of models and data to test hypotheses about the processes controlling carbon dynamics in lakes is rare, despite the importance of lakes in the carbon cycle. We built a suite of models (n=102) representing different hypotheses about lake carbon processing, fit these models to data from a north-temperate lake using data assimilation, and identified which processes were essential for adequately describing the observations. The hypotheses that we tested concerned organic matter lability and its variability through time, temperature dependence of biological decay, photooxidation, microbial dynamics, and vertical transport of water via hypolimnetic entrainment and inflowing density currents. The data included epilimnetic and hypolimnetic CO2 and dissolved organic carbon, hydrologic fluxes, carbon loads, gross primary production, temperature, and light conditions at high frequency for one calibration and one validation year. The best models explained 76-81% and 64-67% of the variability in observed epilimnetic CO2 and dissolved organic carbon content in the validation data. Accurately describing C dynamics required accounting for hypolimnetic entrainment and inflowing density currents, in addition to accounting for biological transformations. In contrast, neither photooxidation nor variable organic matter lability improved model performance. The temperature dependence of biological decay (Q10) was estimated at 1.45, significantly lower than the commonly assumed Q10 of 2. By confronting multiple models of lake C dynamics with observations, we identified processes essential for describing C dynamics in a temperate lake at daily to annual scales, while also providing a methodological roadmap for using data assimilation to further improve understanding of lake C cycling.

AB  - Under consideration is the notion of a 'Psychological Media competence', its significance for the development of personality under the conditions of contemporary media environment is justified. Levels of psychological media competence and its essential components are described. The authors explain psychological mechanism for the development of psychological media competence in association with actualization of the processes of relations, experience and comprehension. A program for the development of psychological media competence in teenagers is put forth.
   Research results whose purpose was shaping of psychological media competence in schoolchildren in the process of implementation of experimental developing programs, were shown. A total of 65 persons took part in the research: 57 teenagers and 8 experts; 22 schoolchildren took their part in the experiment. Level of maturity of psychological media competence was evaluated using techniques to detect ability of teenagers to determine psychological peculiarities of a media text. The structure of the questionnaire was multi-optioned to match the structure of psychological media competence. The content of questions is variable-based and determined by the specifics of media texts under consideration - those were represented by 'Trolls' cartoon and 'Herbaria' tea advertisement video in the proposed research. Analysis of resulting data was carried out using methods of mathematical statistics: ratings of media text by teenagers and by experts were compared, as well as dynamics of indicators of psychological media competence of the participants of the experiment was determined. Weak manifestations of cognitive and reflexive components of psychological media competence of teenagers were determined. Analysis of experiment results showed that the level of understanding of particularities of media texts that determine their effect on consumers, has credibly increased with the participants of the experimental research.

AB  - The environmental status of an area impacted by Roman mining activities was assessed in order to establish the current risks posed by such old mine emplacements. For this purpose, soil samples were collected throughout the mining area and analysed for their total, mobile and mobilizable trace element (As, Cd, Mo, Sb and Zn) contents. Additionally, beehive products (honey and pollen) were also sampled and evaluated for their use as environmental indicators of the area. The results obtained were compared with those from a control non-polluted area. The mine soils presented slightly increased levels of Cd and Sb (about 2- to -3-fold their normal soil concentrations), whereas the enrichment of As reached considerable levels, with concentrations almost ten-fold of those considered the threshold for causing toxicity. Leachable As contents exhibited very high values (1.2-21.9 mg kg(-1)), indicating the need for risk attenuation measures. All trace elements were mainly partitioned in the soil residual fraction, especially Mo (76-99%) and Sb (61-91%). Significant partitioning levels were also found in the reducible fraction of As (up to 35%) and Cd (up to 38%), and in the oxidizable fraction of Mo (up to 23%). The reducible pool of As was particularly relevant due to the eventual mobilization of this element under reducing conditions. Among the beehive products tested, honey proved not to be useful as an environmental indicator, whereas pollen showed great potential as an indicator when the contamination levels were moderate to high.

AB  - The provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) within a landscape is commonly referred to as landscape multifunctionality. Modifying landscapes to increase multifunctionality and reduce trade-offs with concurrent services bears the potential to enhance sustainability in human-dominated landscapes. Assessing landscape multifunctionality is thus crucial for land management and planning, but lack of a clear definition and operationalization of multifunctionality impedes comparisons of different study results.
   We want to address how elements of the study design affect results of multifunctionality assessments. Furthermore, we want to quantify future multifunctionality in the European Union (EU) and indicate the role of land use change and land use diversity on multifunctionality.
   We analyzed diverging scenarios depicting land use change in the EU between 2000 and 2040 for their effects on landscape multifunctionality. We tested different multifunctionality indicators at various spatial scales based on the modelling of 12 ES and biodiversity indicators.
   Particularly the analysis scale determines the interpretation of landscape multifunctionality. Coldspots identified by different indicators are in higher agreement than hotspots. We could not confirm links between land use diversity and landscape multifunctionality. While, at EU scale, multifunctionality slightly increases in future scenarios, agricultural intensification and (peri-)urban growth pose large threats to multifunctional landscapes.
   The choice of indicator and analysis scale strongly determine possible interpretations of the results. Rather than focusing on the impacts of land use change on multifunctionality, it is recommended to base land use policy on the impacts of location-specific change on ES supply and demands.

LA  - English
AB  - Animal welfare is a growing, compelling and urgent topic because of the interest that it generates among the citizens and consumers. The goal to be fulfilled is to define systems and protocols for assessing animal welfare that should be impartial, reproducible and science-based on risk analysis. On these premises, the Italian Ministry of Health has signed an agreement with the IZSLER, through the CReNBA and IZSM through the CReNBuf on development and management of a system to evaluation of welfare and biosecurity in buffaloes breeding system. The checklist development was based on the Risk Assessment Methodology as suggested by EFSA. Building on the CReNBA's work developed on the welfare dairy cow, this method is based on the analysis of two data groups: The assessment of the hazards (non-ABMs) occurring as a result of environmental conditions; the assessment of the risks, with the concerned adverse effects (ABMs), run by animals living in those environments. The system developed consists in 83 observations, listed in a multiple-choice checklist divided in five macro-areas: Farm management and personnel, Facilities and equipment, Animal based measures, Biosecurity and Alarm systems. The result of each area also provides an indication of the burden and importance of each of these on the final calculation of the animal welfare value. These checks represent a functional and smart instrument to allow assign a numerical animal welfare index to each farm. In addition, by the data collected in each area, to supply at the Veterinarians and breeders the tools to improve farm management and structures, respecting the farm's sustainability, and is preparatory to given to the development of a Ministerial trademark for animal welfare, giving answers to consumers and add value to the correct activities of the farmers.

AB  - Reform of higher education in the conditions of deep social and economic transformations determines both optimization of professional training and development of functional capacity of the organism for future work. The initial stage of training is of particular importance due to incorporation into a complex new system of educational environment. The aim of the work - to study the characteristics of adaptation process in the first-year students. Functional state of students' organism was studied by visual-motor response, function of attention, speed, of information processing, tepping-test. This cross-sectional study included 179 first-year medical students. Students with a history of hearing or visual disorder, smoking, alcoholism, cardiovascular and respiratory disease and on medication which affects cognitive performance were excluded from the study. Participation in the test was voluntary and informed written consent was taken from each participant. Academic performance was analyzed Pearson correlation has been used to find the significance of relationship between the speed of thought processes, function of attention, factor of motometria, volume of visual memory and academic performance. Adaptation of students to training is based on the functional system of the body. Expressed correlation between the speed of thought processes (r=0,63, p<0,01), function of attention (r=0,47, p<0,05), ratio of motometry (r=0,45, p<0,05), volume of visual memory (r=0,43, p<0, 05) and academic performance was established. The distribution of these indicators demonstrates the feasibility of using Standard deviation to assess the degree of adaptation.

AB  - Northwestern Pakistan is the leading seed potato-producing area of the country. Potato cultivars grown commercially in the region were screened against Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) under screenhouse conditions and in naturally infested fields during 2010-2014. The potato cultivars, Asterix, Cardinal, Desiree, Diamant, Kuroda, Paramount, Raja, Rocco, Sarpomira, and Ultimas, were grown in viruliferous soil in a bait test and were all found to be susceptible to PMTV (two isolates from Pakistan-Hazara (PMTV-PkH) and Pakistan-Malakand (PMTV-PkM)) in screenhouse experiments. The virus was detected in all cultivars as tested by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in leaf, root, and tuber samples, and by back inoculation of sap from roots of bait plants on indicator plants. The ELISA values (A(405nm)) were lower in leaf, root, and tuber samples in cultivar Desiree compared to the other cultivars, whereas in the infectivity assay, the virus was recovered in all cultivars and exhibited characteristic symptoms on diagnostic hosts. All 10 potato cultivars were further tested against PMTV in previously known infested fields at Baffa, Hazara division, and Kalam, Malakand division, in northwestern Pakistan. The cultivars tested at both sites were found susceptible to PMTV. The virus was detected by DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR in randomly selected potato tubers of each cultivar during 3 years at both sites. We conclude that commercially grown potato cultivars in northwestern Pakistan are susceptible (moderately sensitive to sensitive) to PMTV, requiring a comprehensive potato germplasm screening program for the evaluation of sources of resistance against the virus.

AB  - Lakes under natural conditions are potential indicators of climate change, but limited evidence has been proposed to explicitly explain the mechanisms of large-scale lake changes associated with climate. In this paper, satellite imageries from the 1970s to 2010 were compared to track the dynamic change patterns of plateau lakes. It aims to identify the forcing of climate change on the lakes in plateau regions of China. Results revealed that: (1) widespread expanding trends in the area and abundance of lakes on wetter plateau regions, by increasing precipitation and snow presented a positive effect on lake levels, as well as warming resulted glacier melting and permafrost degrading contributed to expansion of lakes in the regions covered by glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau by 58-62 % and of 13-20 % on the western Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Plateau; (2) shrinkage lakes in the main portion of the arid regions were mainly caused by the decreasing wind speed resulted water balance change, irrigation and other human utilization of water resources. Although precipitation decreased, wind speed also has the most dominant impact on decreasing evaporation, followed by solar radiation, both of which offset the effect of increasing temperature, especially in eastern Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Plateau; (3) thawing permafrost led to shrinkage of lakes in an area of seasonal permafrost, the shrinking and splitting of lakes in a discontinuous permafrost zone, and the rising of lake levels in an area of continuous permafrost; (4) the future of the plateau lakes under climate change must be in question, because the glacier and snow melting water is not sustainable for wetter regions, and the increasing water consumption caused by the farmland expansion for arid regions.

AB  - Vertical greening can contribute to urban green infrastructure, urban heat-island amelioration and climate adaptation. Tropical greenwall practice, hindered by inadequate scientific knowledge and experience, can benefit from objective assessment of species performance and growth deficiency. Comprehensive survey of critical climber-plant traits shortlisted 20 potentially suitable species. A climber-selection matrix was established to facilitate species selection and greenwall design. Perennial woody climbers with ornamental flower or foliage and biological potential to reach 13-m height were preferred. They represented two attachment modes, namely mesh-climber and concrete-(bare-wall)climber groups. A field study was designed to monitor their growth from seedlings in experimental plots. Growth conditions were optimized by providing high-quality soil mix and irrigation. The 32-month study period included three active-growing seasons with two interspersed slow-growing seasons. Field assessment methods were developed to acquire systematic data on plant performance indicators and deficiency symptoms. Key attributes were selected to compute climber performance index (CPI) and climber deficiency index (CDI) as synoptic representation of greenwall-application suitability. Mesh-climbers performed much better than concrete-climbers across all key performance indicators, and with notably better CPI. They demonstrated faster establishment and growth rates and more ornamental flowers. The two groups had similar CDI mainly due to insufficient foliage density and foliage loss. For mesh-climbers, Quisqualis indica, Wisteria sinensis and Lonicera japonica had excellent performance, and the remaining species were good to fair. For concrete-climbers, only Parthenocissus dalzielii was rated good and Campsis grandiflora fair, with the rest poor to very poor. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous empirical evaluations of training programs aimed at improving dog adoption rates assume that dogs exhibiting certain behaviors are more adoptable. However, no systematic data are available to indicate that the spontaneous behavior of shelter dogs has an effect on adopter preference. The aim of the present study was to determine whether any behaviors that dogs exhibit spontaneously in the presence of potential adopters were associated with the dogs' length of stay in the shelter. A sample of 289 dogs was videotaped for 1 min daily throughout their stay at a county shelter. To account for differences in adopter behavior, experimenters varied from solitary passive observers to pairs of interactive observers. Dogs behaved more attentively to active observers. To account for adopter preference for morphology, dogs were divided into "morphologically preferred" and "non-preferred" groups. Morphologically preferred dogs were small, long coated, ratters, herders, and lap dogs. No theoretically significant differences in behavior were observed between the two different dog morphologies. When accounting for morphological preference, three behaviors were found to have a significant effect on length of stay in all dogs: leaning or rubbing on the enclosure wall (increased median length of stay by 30 days), facing away from the front of the enclosure (increased by 15 days), and standing (increased by 7 days). When combinations of behaviors were assessed, back and forth motion was found to predict a longer stay (increased by 24 days). No consistent behavioral changes were observed due to time spent at the shelter. These findings will allow shelters to focus behavioral modification efforts only on behaviors likely to influence adopters' choices.

AB  - In order to increase the organic loading rate (OLR) and hereby the performance of biogas plants an early warning indicator (EWI-VFA/Ca) was applied in a laboratory-scale biogas digester to control process stability and to steer additive dosing. As soon as the EWI-VFA/Ca indicated the change from stable to instable process conditions, calcium oxide was charged as a countermeasure to raise the pH and to bind longchain fatty acids (LCFAs) by formation of aggregates. An interval of eight days between two increases of the OLR, which corresponded to 38% of the hydraulic residence time (HRT), was sufficient for process adaptation. An OLR increase by a factor of three within six weeks was successfully used for biogas production. The OLR was increased to 9.5 kg volatile solids (VS) m-3 c1-1 with up to 87% of fat. The high loading rates affected neither the microbial community negatively nor the biogas production process. Despite the increase of the organic load to high rates, methane production yielded almost its optimum, amounting to 0.9 m3 (kg VS)-1. Beneath several uncharacterized members of the phylum Firmicutes mostly belonging to the family Clostridiaceae, a Syntrophomonas-like organism was identified that is known to live in a syntrophic relationship to methanogenic archaea. Within the methanogenic group, microorganisms affiliated to Methanosarcina, Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium dominated the community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A number of studies have shown that Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) can be applied to quantitatively assess lacustrine sediment constituents. In this study, we developed calibration models based on FTIRS for the quantitative determination of biogenic silica (BSi; n = 420; gradient: 0.9-56.5 %), total organic carbon (TOC; n = 309; gradient: 0-2.9 %), and total inorganic carbon (TIC; n = 152; gradient: 0-0.4 %) in a 318 m-long sediment record with a basal age of 3.6 million years from Lake El'gygytgyn, Far East Russian Arctic. The developed partial least squares (PLS) regression models yield high cross-validated (CV) R-CV(2) = 0.86-0.91 and low root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) (3.1-7.0% of the gradient for the different properties). By applying these models to 6771 samples from the entire sediment record, we obtained detailed insight into bioproductivity variations in Lake El'gygytgyn throughout the middle to late Pliocene and Quaternary. High accumulation rates of BSi indicate a productivity maximum during the middle Pliocene (3.6-3.3 Ma), followed by gradually decreasing rates during the late Pliocene and Quaternary. The average BSi accumulation during the middle Pliocene was similar to 3 times higher than maximum accumulation rates during the past 1.5 million years. The indicated progressive deterioration of environmental and climatic conditions in the Siberian Arctic starting at ca. 3.3 Ma is consistent with the first occurrence of glacial periods and the finally complete establishment of glacial-interglacial cycles during the Quaternary.

AB  - The objective of this investigation was to compare the productivity results, carcass composition and meat quality of pigs reared indoors (average ambient temperature 19.4 degrees C) or outdoors (average ambient temperature 16.0 degrees C) during the summerautumn periods. A total of 56 Lithuanian White (LW)xSwedish Yorkshire (SY)xEnglish Large White (ELW) crossbred pigs were selected out of 14 litters and allotted into two analogous by origin, gender, weight and condition score groups of 26 animals each. The indoor group pigs were raised in pens of 18.5 m(2) area. The outdoor group pigs were raised outdoors in enclosures of 850 m(2) area. The productivity of pigs was determined by individual weighing. The carcass measurements (carcass weight and length, dressing percentage, backfat thickness and loin lean area) were determined and recalculated for 100 kg weight. The samples of the longissimus muscle were analysed for physicochemical indicators of meat. The study indicated that in the growing period and during the whole experiment, the outdoor group pigs gained higher average daily weight, respectively, by 26.8 (P=0.003) and 12.7% (P=0.013) than the pigs in the indoor group. The carcass traits were not different between the groups, but in all cases the outdoor group showed lower fat thickness. Rearing environment did not significantly influence the physicochemical indicators of meat and backfat, but the meat from the pigs raised outdoors had slightly higher (0.76%, P=0.088) crude protein levels.

AB  - The application of genomics to population health has the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine. Indeed, discoveries into the genomic basis of cancer and other common chronic diseases have resulted in new and improved predictive tests for identifying individuals at increased risk for these conditions and long before their onset occurs. When used properly, information gained from predictive genomic tests can be combined with other leading indicators (e.g., environmental and behavioral risk factors) to inform medical management decisions, preventive health practices, and risk-reducing strategies. However, genomics remains an emerging science and the translation of genomic discoveries into improved population health management remains elusive. There are divides in the translational science continuum at several junctures, and many of these divides could be narrowed or closed with additional data. For example, we know relatively little about how to effectively communicate with the public about the complex interplay among genomics, behavior, and health. Moreover, there is a need to develop better methods of counseling and educating the public in light of newly emerging knowledge about the genomic basis of health and disease. We assert that the discipline of psychology, and health psychology in particular, is well-poised to continue to make significant contributions to this growing area of science and practice. Through a focus on health-related social and behavioral research, psychology can lead the way in overcoming divides in communication, understanding, and action about genomics for the betterment of both individual and public health practices.

AB  - This paper aimed to illustrate the most reliable biomarkers to detect pollution-related oxidative stress in white stork nestlings in polluted (from copper manufacture), suburban and Odra meadows (as a control area) areas. Lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content, TBARS) and oxidative modified protein levels (stable 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine derivates of the carbonyl groups) were used as indicators of the oxidative stress, as well as other selected biochemical parameters, which are used as diagnostic tools in avian medicine (alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase activities, lactate and pyruvate concentrations). It was found that the blood of chicks from the polluted area was more susceptible to oxidative stress due to lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, manifested as protein carbonyls, the elevation of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases activities, and lactate and pyruvate concentrations than those of chicks from suburban and Odra meadows areas. Direct connections between lactate and pyruvate concentrations and lipid peroxidation (TBARS level), as well as between derivates of carbonyl oxidation levels in the blood of chicks from the polluted area were detected. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was slightly inhibited in the blood of chicks from the polluted environment, perhaps because of increased lactate concentration in the blood of chicks from polluted areas. It can be suggested that alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase activities, lactate and pyruvate concentrations can be used as indicators of oxidative stress. The activities of these enzymes were perhaps not directly related to environmental pollution, but more likely to some secondary pollution-related changes in the nestlings' conditions.

AB  - 1. We collected chironomid larvae and measured basic environmental variables in eight high mountain streams with different degrees of glacial influence in southern Tibet. 2. In total, 32 chironomid taxa were collected. The Orthocladiinae subfamily dominated both in taxon number and in abundance. 3. Both average taxon number and abundance were lower in glacier-fed streams compared with those of non-glacial origin. The total taxon number collected (? diversity) was similar regardless of glacial influence. However, spot diversity (a diversity) was higher in non-glacial streams, while glacier-fed streams supported higher species turnover (beta diversity). 4. Detrended correspondence analysis scattered the study sites along the first ordination axis, representing a combination of distance from glacier and channel stability. Two-way indicator analysis distinguished three groups of sites. Group 1 represented the sites closest to the glacier and were characterised by unstable channel conditions and low temperature with characteristic taxa Diamesa sp. 1, Orthocladius (Eud.) sp. and Rheocricotopus sp. Group 2 was made up of glacier-fed streams situated further from glaciers, with unstable channels and characterised by Orthocladius (Euo.) sp. Group 3 contained non-glacial streams as well as a glacier-fed stream further from the glacier margin. For these sites, stable channels and high conductivity were characteristic and Cricotopus (C.) sp., Pseudosmittia sp, Polypedilum sp., Eukiefferiella gracei group and Pagastia sp. 1 were the dominating taxa. 5. We propose a general distribution pattern of chironomids in the streams of glacial and non-glacial influence in Tibet, which is in accordance with the model proposed by Milner et al. (2001a) Freshwater Biology, 46, 18331847.

AB  - The interaction between silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) of different surface charge and surfactants relevant to the laundry cycle has been investigated to understand changes in speciation, both in and during transport from the washing machine. Ag NPs were synthesized to exhibit either a positive or a negative surface charge in solution conditions relevant for the laundry cycle (pH 10 and pH 7). These particles were characterized in terms of size and surface charge and compared to commercially laser ablated Ag NPs. The surfactants included anionic sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (LAS), cationic dodecyltrimethyl-ammoniumchloride (DTAC) and nonionic Berol 266 (Berol). Surfactant Ag NP interactions were studied by means of dynamic light scattering, Raman spectroscopy, zeta potential, and Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Mixed bilayers of CTAB and LAS were formed through a co-operative adsorption process on positively charged Ag NPs with pre-adsorbed CTAB, resulting in charge reversal from positive to negative zeta potentials. Adsorption of DTAC on negatively charged synthesized Ag NPs and negatively charged commercial Ag NPs resulted in bilayer formation and charge reversal. Weak interactions were observed for nonionic Berol with all Ag NPs via hydrophobic interactions, which resulted in decreased zeta potentials for Berol concentrations above its critical micelle concentration. Differences in particle size were essentially not affected by surfactant adsorption, as the surfactant layer thicknesses did not exceed more than a few nanometers. The surfactant interaction with the Ag NP surface was shown to be reversible, an observation of particular importance for hazard and environmental risk assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Environmental engineering of navigation infrastructure: A survey of existing practices, challenges, and potential opportunities
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Navigation infrastructure such as channels, jetties, river training structures, and lock-and-dam facilities are primary components of a safe and efficient water transportation system. Planning for such infrastructure has until recently involved efforts to minimize impacts on the environment through a standardized environmental assessment process. More recently, consistent with environmental sustainability concepts, planners have begun to consider how such projects can also be constructed with environmental enhancements. This study examined the existing institutional conditions within the US Army Corps of Engineers and cooperating federal agencies relative to incorporating environmental enhancements into navigation infrastructure projects. The study sought to (1) investigate institutional attitudes towards the environmental enhancement of navigation infrastructure (EENI) concept, (2) identify potential impediments to implementation and solutions to such impediments, (3) identify existing navigation projects designed with the express intent of enhancing environmental benefit in addition to the primary project purpose, (4) identify innovative ideas for increasing environmental benefits for navigation projects, (5) identify needs for additional technical information or research, and (6) identify laws, regulations, and policies that both support and hinder such design features. The principal investigation tool was an Internet-based survey with 53 questions. The survey captured a wide range of perspectives on the EENI concept including ideas, concerns, research needs, and relevant laws and policies. Study recommendations included further promotion of the concept of EENI to planners and designers, documentation of existing projects, initiation of pilot studies on some of the innovative ideas provided through the survey, and development of national goals and interagency agreements to facilitate implementation.

AB  - Interactions between predators and their prey are influenced by the habitat they occupy. Using created oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reef mesocosms, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments that created structure and manipulated complexity as well as prey density and "predator-free space" to examine the relationship between structural complexity and prey survivorship. Specifically, volume and spatial arrangement of oysters as well as prey density were manipulated, and the survivorship of prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio) in the presence of a predator (wild red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) was quantified. We found that the presence of structure increased prey survivorship, and that increasing complexity of this structure further increased survivorship, but only to a point. This agrees with the theory that structural complexity may influence predator-prey dynamics, but that a threshold exists with diminishing returns. These results held true even when prey density was scaled to structural complexity, or the amount of "predator-free space" was manipulated within our created reef mesocosms. The presence of structure and its complexity (oyster shell volume) were more important in facilitating prey survivorship than perceived refugia or density-dependent prey effects. A more accurate indicator of refugia might require "predator-free space" measures that also account for the available area within the structure itself (i.e., volume) and not just on the surface of a structure. Creating experiments that better mimic natural conditions and test a wider range of "predator-free space" are suggested to better understand the role of structural complexity in oyster reefs and other complex habitats.

AB  - An often-suggested mechanism of virus induced neuronal damage is oxidative stress. Astrocytes have an important role in controlling oxidative stress of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Astrocytes help maintain a homeostatic environment for neurons as well as protecting neurons from Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). CM-H2DCFDA is a cell-permeable indicator for the presence of ROS. CM-H(2)DCFDA enters the cell as a non-fluorescent compound, and becomes fluorescent after cellular esterases remove the acetate groups, and the compound is oxidized. The number of cells, measured by flow cytometry, that are found to be green fluorescing is an indication of the number of cells that are in an oxidative state. CM-H(2)DCFDA is susceptible to oxidation by a large number of different ROS. This lack of specificity, regarding which ROS can oxidize CM-H(2)DCFDA, makes this compound a valuable regent for use in the early stages of a pathogenesis investigation, as this assay can be used to screen for an oxidative cellular environment regardless of which oxygen radical or combination of ROS are responsible for the cellular conditions. Once it has been established that ROS are present by oxidation of CM-H(2)DCFDA, then additional experiments can be performed to determine which ROS or combination of ROSs are involved in the particular pathogenesis process. The results of this study demonstrate that with the addition of hydrogen peroxide an increase in CM-H(2)DCFDA fluoresce was detected relative to the saline controls, indicating that this assay is a valuable test for detecting an oxidative environment within G355-5 cells, a feline astrocyte cell line.

AB  - Early Campanian non-marine - marine cycles of the Grunbach Formation (Gosau Group, Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria) within the Grunbach Syncline have been investigated using sedimentology, micropaleontology and geochemistry. The succession of the Grunbach Formation comprises clay, marl, siltstone, sandstone as well as rare conglomerate and coal beds deposited in a marginal marine to terrestrial, brackish-limnic environment. Sampling was done from a 45 m section of an artificial trench at Maiersdorf, Lower Austria. Palynological data indicate quite warm and humid depositional conditions. The observation of Nypa pollen represents the northernmost occurrence known so far from the Campanian. Based on geochemical proxies (whole rock geochemistry and bulk carbon and oxygen isotopy) as well as microfossil data, five marine (MC1-5) to non-marine cycles (NC1-5) are reconstructed. Marine intervals were identified basically by the presence of nannofossils and by higher mean delta C-13 ratios (-4.51 VPDB), boron contents (mean 165.8 ppm) and B/Al* ratios (mean 167.2) compared to sections interpreted as non-marine (mean delta C-13: -6.34 VPDB, B: 139.0 ppm, B/Al*: 149.4). A statistically significant differentiation between marine and non-marine samples is possible using the aluminium-normalized boron ratio and, to a lower degree, the absolute boron values. A duration of a few 100 kyrs is estimated for single non-marine - marine cycles. Low subsidence rates and uniform provenance data argue against a purely tectonic origin of the cycles and are in favor for a mainly climatic control of these transgressive-regressive cycles in the Early Campanian.

AB  - The northeastern United States is one of the most variable climates in the world, and how climate extremes are changing is critical to populations, industries, and the environment in this region. A long-term (1870-2005) temperature and precipitation dataset was compiled for the northeastern United States to assess how the climate has changed. Adjustments were made to daily temperatures to account for changes in mean, variance, and skewness resulting from inhomogeneities, but precipitation data were not adjusted. Trends in 17 temperature and 10 precipitation indices at 40 stations were evaluated over three time periods-1893-2005, 1893-1950, and 1951-2005 and over 1870-2005 for a subset of longer-term stations. Temperature indices indicate strong warming with increases in the frequency of warm events (e.g., warm nights and warm summer days) and decreases in the frequency of cold events (e.g., ice days, frost days, and the cold spell duration indicator). The strongest warming is exhibited in the decrease in frost days and the increase in growing season length. Although maximum temperatures indices showed strong warming trends over the period 1893-1950, subsequent trends show little change and cooling. Few significant trends were present in the precipitation indices; however, they displayed a tendency toward wetter conditions. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that some of the variability in the 27 indices from 1951 to 2002 was explained by the North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific decadal oscillation, and Pacific North American pattern. However, teleconnection patterns showed little influence on the 27 indices over a 103-yr period.

AB  - This article develops computational tools, called indicators, for judging the effectiveness of the auxiliary information used to control nonresponse bias in survey estimates, obtained in this article by calibration. This work is motivated by the survey environment in a number of countries, notably in northern Europe, where many potential auxiliary variables are derived from reliable administrative registers for household and individuals. Many auxiliary vectors can be composed. There is a need to compare these vectors to assess their potential for reducing bias. The indicators in this article are designed to meet that need. They are used in surveys at Statistics Sweden. General survey conditions are considered: There is probability sampling from the finite population, by an arbitrary sampling design; nonresponse occurs. The probability of inclusion in the sample is known for each population unit; the probability of response is unknown, causing bias. The study variable (the y-variable) is observed for the set of respondents only. No matter what auxiliary vector is used in a calibration estimator (or in any other estimation method), a residual bias will always remain. The choice of a "best possible" auxiliary vector is guided by the indicators proposed in the article. Their background and computational features are described in the early sections of the article. Their theoretical background is explained. The concluding sections are devoted to empirical studies. One of these illustrates the selection of auxiliary variables in a survey at Statistics Sweden. A second empirical illustration is a simulation with a constructed finite population; a number of potential auxiliary vectors are ranked in order of preference with the aid of the indicators.

AB  - Stress exacerbates several physical and psychological disorders. Voluntary exercise can reduce susceptibility to many of these stress-associated disorders. In rodents, voluntary exercise can reduce hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity in response to various stressors as well as upregulate several brain neurotrophins. An important issue regarding voluntary exercise is whether its effect on the reduction of HPA axis activation in response to stress is due to the physical activity itself or simply the enhanced environmental complexity provided by the running wheels. The present study compared the effects of physical activity and environmental complexity (that did not increase physical activity) on HPA axis habituation to repeated stress and modulation of brain neurotrophin mRNA expression. For six weeks, male rats were given free access to running wheels (exercise group), given 4 objects that were repeatedly exchanged (increased environmental complexity group), or housed in standard cages. On week 7, animals were exposed to 11 consecutive daily 30-min sessions of 98-dBA noise. Plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone were measured from blood collected directly after noise exposures. Tissue, including brains, thymi, and adrenal glands was collected on Day 11. Although rats in both the exercise and enhanced environmental complexity groups expressed higher levels of BDNF and NGF mRNA in several brain regions, only exercise animals showed quicker glucocorticoid habituation to repeated audiogenic stress. These results suggest that voluntary exercise, independent from other environmental manipulations, accounts for the reduction in susceptibility to stress. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Declines in sea-ice habitats have resulted in declining stature, productivity, and survival of polar bears in some regions. With continuing sea-ice declines, negative population effects are projected to expand throughout the polar bear's range. Precise causes of diminished polar bear life history performance are unknown, however, climate and sea-ice condition change are expected to adversely impact polar bear (Ursus maritimus) health and population dynamics. As apex predators in the Arctic, polar bears integrate the status of lower trophic levels and are therefore sentinels of ecosystem health. Arctic residents feed at the apex of the ecosystem, thus polar bears can serve as indicators of human health in the Arctic. Despite their value as indicators of ecosystem welfare, population-level health data for U.S. polar bears are lacking. We present hematological reference ranges for southern Beaufort Sea polar bears. Hematological parameters in southern Beaufort Sea polar bears varied by age, geographic location, and reproductive status. Total leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and serum immunoglobulin G were significantly greater in males than females. These measures were greater in nonlactating females ages a parts per thousand yen5, than lactating adult females ages a parts per thousand yen5, suggesting that females encumbered by young may be less resilient to new immune system challenges that may accompany ongoing climate change. Hematological values established here provide a necessary baseline for anticipated changes in health as arctic temperatures warm and sea-ice declines accelerate. Data suggest that females with dependent young may be most vulnerable to these changes and should therefore be a targeted cohort for monitoring in this sentinel.

AB  - Blood is an indicator of physiological condition of an animal. Therefore, a field study was conducted to investigate the hematological parameters of wild population of rohu, Labeo rohita (Ham). The following aspects were evaluated in blood: hemoglobin content, red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) count, packed cell volume (PCV), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) values, and in plasma: cholesterol, protein, and glucose levels. For this purpose, rohu fish of varying sizes and weights were sampled from Hebbal (receiving a storm water drain) and Chowkalli lake (received domestic sewage and industrial effluents from various sources and was more polluted than Hebbal lake). It revealed noticeable differences in hemoglobin content, RBC and WBC count, and PCV and MCHC values. Severe anemia can be marked by a significant decrease in RBC count (p < 0.5), hemoglobin content, and PCV and MCHC values, whereas an increase in leukocyte count and MCV values were observed in fish from Chowkalli lake. Fish from lake B had fewer RBC and low concentration of serum protein and cholesterol. Serum concentration of glucose showed initial higher levels and then low concentration (900-1,500 g) in fish from lake B when compared to lake A. The variation in values of different parameters can be attributed to exposure of fish to various types of pollutants present mainly in the Chowkalli lake which receives heavy metals, synthetic detergents, petroleum products, and other acid and alkali substances from the nearby local industries. Other observations of these fish include dark body color and aggressive nature of fish.

AB  - Recently, the European Commission (EC) has published a proposal for a Council Regulation on the protection of animals at the time of killing. The proposed regulation will enhance the technical requirements of Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing, which have not been amended since 1993. The main specific problems identified with the present EU legislation are the lack of harmonized methodology for new stunning methods, the lack of clear responsibilities for operators on animal welfare, the insufficient competence of personnel handling animals and insufficient conditions for the welfare of animals during killing for disease control purposes. The adoption of the "Hygiene Regulation Package", which emphasizes the responsibilities of the food business operators on food safety, has also changed the legal environment for slaughterhouses. Furthermore, the first Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, adopted by the EC in 2006, introduced new concepts such as the welfare indicators and the need for further research programs and centres of reference on animal welfare. Also, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted two scientific opinions in 2004 and 2006 on the different stunning and killing methods to be used for main farm species either for slaughter for human consumption or for disease control purposes. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in 2005 also adopted two international guidelines on the welfare of animals at slaughter. After presenting a picture of situation of meat sector in EU, the Author provides a broad overview on the regulatory situation and considers the legislative and scientific perspectives that lead the EC to draft new rules in this regard.

AB  - Lake Balaton (Hungary), one of the largest lakes in Europe, has undergone eutrophication and restoration during the last two decades. The first quantitative phytoplankton records date back to the 1930s, and since that time thousands of data have been published or accumulated in counting protocols or computer sheets. These data provide material for both scientific analyses (e.g. effects of global change) and applications (e.g. estimation of reference state for the Water Framework Directive). The ALMOBAL phytoplankton database was developed to provide computing support for these applications. It stores data in standardized forms, handles synonyms and allows analyses to be conducted on the basis of floral records, numbers or biomass. The analysis includes records of about 3000 phytoplankton samples taken during the past 60 years from two representative basins in Lake Balaton. This article represents the first attempt at historical reconstruction of the ecological status and compares it with changes in trophic state and current water quality. The results indicate that the phytoplankton biomass and community structure found in the early 1960s could be regarded as reference conditions. Statistical analyses support the view that late summer phytoplankton assemblages are the most sensitive indicators of trophic change, and clearly show the eutrophication of the lake that occurred from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s and the restoration during the last decade. An additional advantage is that, since quality estimation is based on relative biomass, the method can be used to reconstruct water quality in cases when counting protocols are available, but some basic data for quantitative estimates are missing.

AB  - Meat spoilage during distribution can be considered as an ecological phenomenon that encompasses the changes of the available substrata (e.g., low molecular compounds), during the prevailing of a particular microbial association, the so-called specific spoilage organisms (SSO). In fact, spoilage of meat depends on an even smaller fraction of SSO, called ephemeral spoilage organisms (ESO). These ESO are the consequence of factors that dynamically persist or imposed during, e.g., processing, transportation and storage in the market. Meanwhile spoilage is a subjective judgment by the consumer, which may be influenced by cultural and economic considerations and background as well as by the sensory acuity of the individual and the intensity of the change. Indeed, when spoilage progresses, most consumers would agree that gross discoloration, strong off-odors, and the-development of slime would constitute the main qualitative criteria for meat rejection.
   On the other hand, meat industry needs rapid analytical methods or tools for quantification of these indicators to determine the type of processing needed for their raw material and to predict remaining shelf life of their products. The need of an objective evaluation of meat spoilage is of great importance. The use of metabolomics as a potential tool for the evaluation of meat spoilage can be of great importance.

AB  - Dialysis experiments were used to assess lability of Fe in boreal stream waters as well as synthetic solutions with the chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 8-hydroxyquinoline in Bold Basal Medium (BBM). It was hypothesized that irradiation (UV and visible) of organic-Fe complexes would result in enhanced movement of Fe across a dialysis membrane with a 100Da molecular weight cutoff. Irradiation of boreal stream waters at pH 4 with UV plus visible radiation consistently resulted in increased Fe concentrations in the dialysis tubing containing 1.0 mM deferoxamine (a chelator)compared to the dark controls. Significant Fe lability occurred in the absence of UVB and UVA when stream water was exposed to visible wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, but not when exposed to 550-700 nm. Irradiation of BBM media with EDTA with and without UVA under visible light increased lability of Fe and Co but not Mn, Cu or Zn, relative to dark controls indicating that EDTA binding strength is light sensitive for some metals. In contrast, Fe lability in the presence of 8-hydroxyquinoline was not significantly affected by UVA plus visible light relative to a dark control. If lability is used an indicator of biologically availability, then light intensity and spectral quality likely affects the supply rate of biologically available Fe and perhaps other metals in situ. Light conditions may also affect supply rates of biologically available metals in algal cultures, depending on the chelator used.

AB  - Nociceptive neurons in the peripheral nervous system detect noxious stimuli and report the information to the central nervous system. Most nociceptive neurons express the vanilloid receptor, TRPV 1, a nonselective cation channel gated by vanilloid ligands such as capsaicin, the pungent essence of chili peppers. Here, we report the synthesis and biological application of two caged vanilloids: biologically inert precursors that, when photolyzed, release bioactive vanilloid ligands. The two caged vanilloids, Nb-VNA and Nv-VNA, are photoreleased with quantum efficiency of 0. 13 and 0.04 1, respectively. Under flash photolysis conditions, photorelease of Nb-VNA and Nv-VNA is 95% complete in similar to 40 mu s and similar to 125 mu s, respectively. Through 1 -photon excitation with ultraviolet light (360 nm), or 2-photon excitation with red light (720 nm), the caged vanilloids can be photoreleased in situ to activate TRPV1 receptors on nociceptive neurons. The consequent increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) can be Visualized by laser-scanning confocal imaging of neurons loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3. Simulation results from TRPV1 receptor activation, because the response is blocked by capsazepine, a selective TRPV1 antagonist. In Ca2+-free extracellular medium, photoreleased vanilloid can still elevate [Ca2+](i), which suggests that TRPV1 receptors also reside on endomembranes in neurons and can mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Notably, whole-cell voltage clamp measurements showed that flash photorelease of vanilloid can activate TRPV1 channels in <4 ms at 22 degrees C. In combination with 1- or 2-photon excitation, caged vanilloids are a powerful tool for probing morphologically distinct structures of nociceptive sensory neurons with high spatial and temporal precision.

AB  - We asked how the richness of the specialized (endemic) flora of serpentine rock outcrops in California varies at both the regional and local scales. Our study had two goals: first, to test whether endemic richness is affected by spatial habitat structure (e.g., regional serpentine area, local serpentine outcrop area, regional and local measures of outcrop isolation), and second, to conduct this test in the context of a broader assessment of environmental influences. (e.g., climate, soils, vegetation, disturbance) and historical influences (e.g., geologic age, geographic province) on local and regional species richness. We measured endemic and total richness and environmental variables in 109 serpentine sites (1000-m(2) paired plots) in 78 serpentine-containing regions of the state. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to simultaneously relate regional richness to regional-scale predictors, and local richness to both local-scale and regional-scale predictors. Our model for serpentine endemics explained 66% of the variation in local endemic richness based on local environment (vegetation, soils, rock cover) and on regional endemic richness. It explained 73% of the variation in regional endemic richness based on regional environment (climate and productivity), historical factors (geologic age and geographic province), and spatial structure (regional total area of serpentine, the only significant spatial variable in our analysis). We did not find a strong influence of spatial structure on species richness. However, we were able to distinguish local vs. regional influences on species richness to a novel extent, despite the existence of correlations between local and regional conditions.

AB  - Bovine eye lens a-crystallin was covalently labeled with 6-bromomethyl-4'-diethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone and studied under native-like conditions and at the elevated temperature (60 degrees C) that is known to facilitate alpha-crystallin chaperone-like activity. This novel SH-reactive two-band ratiometric fluorescent probe is characterized by two highly emissive N*- and T*-bands; the latter appears due to excited state intramolecular proton transfer reaction. The positions of these bands and the ratio of their intensities for the a-crystallin-dye conjugate are the sensitive indicators of polarity of the dye environment and its participation in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Although we found that the dye labels both the SH and the NH2 groups in alpha-crystallin, a recently developed procedure allowed us to distinguish between the heat-induced spectral changes of the dye molecules attached to SH and NH2 groups. We observed that at elevated temperature the environment of the SH-attached dye becomes more polar and flexible. The number of H-bond acceptor groups in the vicinity of the dye decreases. Since alpha-crystallin contains a single Cys residue within the C-terminal domain of its alpha A subunit (the alpha B subunit contains none), we can attribute the observed effects to temperature-induced changes in the C-terminal domain of this protein.

AB  - Purpose of review Neurobiological research literature on anxiety and anxiety disorders of the previous year (April 2003-June 2004) is investigated from the perspective of four conceptual questions: (1) is pathological anxiety an animal, a human or a layered phenomenon with aspects of both? (2) Is anxiety a unitary or a nonunitary phenomenon? (3) What is the relationship between different aspects, or 'components', of anxiety? (4) What is the relationship between scientific and clinical concepts of anxiety?
   Recent findings These questions are investigated in research papers in the areas of fear conditioning, delineation of neural pathways underlying aspects of anxiety (and anxiety disorder), and developmental plasticity. Most authors are inclined to a view in which both animal and human aspects are recognized and combined in some way (ad 1). Investigators are predominantly inclined to a nonunitary view, against the background model of multiple overlapping brain circuits (ad 2). The language of causal interaction between reified subsystems is avoided, leaving undiscussed the issue of the unity of brain functioning and the relationship of neural function and subjective experience (ad 3). The dominant framework seems to be noneliminative physicalist. There is a widely acknowledged conceptual gap between clinical and scientific understanding; however, newer methodologies enable a broader understanding, by taking into account that environmental factors play an important role in brain development and that study of regional circuitry is needed above study of neural loci (ad 4).
   Summary There is a paucity of papers on purely conceptual issues. The rich phenomenology of anxiety should serve as an incentive to deeper understanding. Conceptual rigor and refinement may have an important impact upon fundamental empirical research.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that males adjust their sexually selected display traits in response to female behaviors during courtships. Little is known, however, about whether females signal to influence male displays and whether females benefit from this interaction. Male courtship displays in the satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) are highly intense and aggressive. Females may use these displays as indicators of mating benefits, but these displays often startle females and disrupt courtship. Previous studies have shown that successful males decrease female startling by adjusting their display intensity according to female crouching behaviors, suggesting that crouching behaviors function as signals. Here we address whether female crouching is a signal by using observations of natural courtship behaviors. In addition, we examine why females differ in signaling and whether females benefit from signaling. First, we find that female crouching is related to the likelihood that females will be startled by male displays, suggesting that crouching signals the degree of display intensity that females will tolerate from a male without being startled. Second, we find that female tolerance for intense display increases during successive courtships as females assess potential mates, and that female tolerance may also be affected by age and condition. Third, we find evidence that females that reduce startling by signaling their intensity tolerance are more efficient in mate searching. These results suggest that females signal to influence how males display their sexually selected traits, and by doing so, females may increase their benefits in mate choice.

AB  - Abundance and frequency of dinoflagellate cysts in 19 surface sediment samples from the northern part of the Swedish west coast has been related to physical and chemical characters of the sediment, hydrography of the overlying water column, and plankton species data from the area. Density of cysts varied between 5000 and 10 1000 cysts g(-1) dw, and the most commonly encountered species were Lingulodinium polyedrum and Protoceratium reticulatum. In all, 46 environmental variables were tested for their relation to dinoflagellate cyst densities, proportion of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa, and individual species distribution and frequency. The outcomes of multivariate analyses, projection to latent structures (PLS) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were consistent with each other and the actual cyst count. The density of the total cyst assemblage (>90% autotrophic taxa) was primarily related to surface temperature, macronutrients, and inversely to phytoplankton competitors, such as diatoms. The abundance of heterotrophic taxa was governed by the preferences of their prey, i.e. diatom-favourable conditions, and, in most cases, higher proportions of heterotrophic taxa were found at well-mixed sites. Some possible effects of anthropogenic contaminants were also noted. Several taxa showed distinct distribution patterns with respect to the environmental variables. A discrepancy between the species constituting the planktonic and the benthic community was revealed when data from 6 yr of plankton monitoring was compared to the data on distribution of dinoflagellate cysts. In particular, cyst-forming species were only a minor part of the plankton, suggesting that these dinoflagelldtes spend much of their life in the sediments.

AB  - field investigation conducted on Boulder Creek in Boulder, Colorado evaluated impacts of flood control maintenance activities on flood conveyance, water quality, and fish habitat. Thirty-nine transects were monitored at one control site and two maintenance sites over a period of eight months. Each site was visited on more than 50 occasions in order to characterize pre- and post-maintenance conditions, and to monitor maintenance activities. Measurements along the transects included substrate composition, flow depth, velocity, and elevation. Reach-average values were assigned to variables such as in-stream vegetation, streambank stability, and woody vegetation before and after maintenance. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, and turbidity were sampled, and habitat suitability indices were developed pre- and post-maintenance for seven indicator fish species. Water quality impacts during maintenance consisted of high turbidity levels (> 400 NTU), which returned to background levels (0.1-15 NTU) overnight, as well as changes in mean temperature and pH. Alteration of physical channel characteristics as a result of maintenance had limited effects on habitat quality for four of seven fish species, but caused improvements in habitat quality for three fish species. The main implications of this study for floodplain management are that: (1) Flood control maintenance practices can be in direct conflict with water quality and fish habitat objectives, and should be carefully designed and implemented by an interdisciplinary team. (2) Physical habitat for some fish species can be improved as well as reduced by maintenance activities. Habitat suitability curves may be useful tools for evaluating limiting factors of the habitat and for identifying opportunities for habitat improvements as part of maintenance.

AB  - An exposed section of nearly 13 m thick was investigated in the ancient depression of Lake Eastern Juyanze, north-eastern China. The succession of lacustrine and aeolian deposits covers a period from about 5400 to 2700 cal. a BP as indicated by four radiocarbon ages of macro-plant debris, Fifteen ostracod taxa were identified of which Limnocythere inopinata and Darwinula stevensoni are by far the most abundant species. Stable isotope (O, C) data of ostracod calcite as well as ostracod species abundances and X-ray diffraction results of bulk sediment samples were used to reconstruct the history of Lake Eastern Juyanze. Highest lake levels (water depth similar to10 m) occurred between 5 100 and 4100 cal. a BP and were succeeded by intermediate and low levels until about 3150 cal. a BP. Three short-term events of complete desiccation were recorded between 3150 and 2900 cal. a BP. The lake experienced relatively high levels again for some decades at about 3000 cal. a BP and for at least two centuries after 2900 cal. a BR According to the ostracod and gastropod record and the high abundance of a large diatom (Campylodiscus clypeus) in the lake sediments oligohaline to slightly mesohaline conditions were reconstructed for most of the lake periods (4-6 g/l). Geochemical and palaeontological records of Lake Eastern Juyanze reveal the retreat of the Asian monsoon after China's Hypsithermal culminating in climate instability at about 3000 cal. a BP.

AB  - The loss of freshwater fluvial habitats is generally regarded as a key factor in the precipitous decline of native salmonids in the northwestern United States. State and federal water quality regulations, under the authority of the Clean Water Act (CWA), could be more relevant to recovery of Pacific salmon if physical habitat quality was explicitly integrated into water quality standards. We examine the concept of incorporating instream habitat measures into water quality regulations since these standards are the foundation of CWA programs. Commonly measured instream habitat variables for salmonids (flow regime, habitat space, channel structure, substrate quality, streambank stability) were evaluated in terms of their suitability as water quality criteria. The basis for this evaluation focused on these indicators in light of their: (1) relevance to ecological requirements of salmonid fishes, (2) applicability to landscape processes and the stream network in which they occur, (3) responsiveness to human-caused stressors (linking cause v. effect), and (4) degree of measurement reliability and precision. Our evaluation suggests that most habitat indicators, as currently measured, do not meet these criteria due to the limitations in the state of the science as well as constraints imposed by the existing framework for water quality standards. There is general agreement on salmonid habitat requirements and the effects of land use on these habitats; there is less certainty on quantifying physical habitat quality and on the reliability of habitat assessment techniques. These obstacles can be overcome by applying the principles of landscape ecology and stream network classification to indicator development, identifying and quantifying reference area conditions at a regional scale, calibrating relevant indicators to specific locales, and developing systematic monitoring procedures that meet rigorous data quality objectives.

TI  - Meeting the challenge of distressed urban areas
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The emergence of distressed urban areas in the 1990s was unexpected. Governments have reacted with a series of policy initiatives which have increasingly focused on area-based strategies, partnerships and the formulation of a metropolitan vision. The scale of the problem-up to 20 per cent of the total population may live in distressed urban areas-and the complexity of causes are two factors which have complicated the design and implementation of policy, Better indicators are needed, especially to check the tendency towards a rhetoric of polarisation which makes the problems appear impossible to solve. A recent OECD study and a study of partnerships undertaken by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EFILWC) call attention to the importance of local participation and of business and labour in local strategies for regeneration. To compare experiences and analyses their policy implications, the OECD and the EFILWC organised a conference in Dublin in 1998, of which this paper is an analytical report. One of the findings of the conference deserving further study concerns the role of the media in shaping public opinion on regeneration issues; another concerns the need for preventive strategies and policies; and a third concerns the linkages between regeneration, education and job training and employment. There is a need for policy-makers and academic researchers to work towards a common agenda and a shared discourse, In the final analysis, the study of distressed areas can reveal much about the nature of larger urban economic and social processes. But the responsibility of government to act means making some informed judgement about how to intervene, and why intervention is necessary, even on the basis of imperfect information.

AB  - The New Texas serpentine barrens is a rare, natural savanna in southeastern PA that is rapidly succeeding to forest, probably as a result of fire exclusion. We tested the hypothesis that the invasive tree, Pinus virginiana, is modifying soil conditions in a way that may promote conversion to forest. We analyzed soil (1) next to P. virginiana of different ages and sizes and at varying distances from these trees and (2) in early successional savanna sites versus late succession forest sites. Mineral soil depth and litter depth increased with size of and proximity to trees and from savanna to forest, suggesting that P. virginiana exerts strong effects on soil at the tree scale that lead to similar changes at the stand level. Individual P. virginiana also appear to increase organic matter and Ca:Mg ratio, a key indicator of serpentine infertility. These soil chemical trends, however, were not replicated at the stand level: forest soils actually had similar or lower nutrient and organic matter levels than early successional savanna and exhibited no difference in Ca:Mg ratio. Differences between soil development trends on the two scales may be related to slower decomposition rates in pine forest compared to grassland, although much more complex mechanisms may also be involved. Although P. virginiana does not, at the stand level, appear to ameliorate soil chemical imbalances endemic to serpentine soils, its positive influence on soil depth alone could promote further succession towards forests typical of non-serpentine sites in the region.

AB  - The contribution of light-independent carbon fixation (LICF) to the overall carbon gain and the seasonal patterns of maximum photosynthesis (P-max) and LICF were characterized in a broad taxonomic range of macrophytes from Monterey Bay, California. P-max and LICF rates (nmol C.g filtered seawater(-1).min(-1)) varied among species and taxonomic groups examined and as a function of tissue type in the phaeophyte Laminaria setchellii Silva (Phaeophyceae). On average, P-max values were higher in the Rhodophyta, whereas LICF rates were greater in the Phaeophyceae. LICF rates were generally less than 5% of P-max in the marine macrophytes studied and, as a consequence, cannot fully compensate for respiratory carbon losses, which usually are greater than 10% of P-max. All species studied possessed the highest P-max and LICF rates when irradiance levels were highest and decreased during periods of low incident irradiance. Seasonal patterns of P-max and LICF in most of the macrophytes from the stenothermal environment ofMonterty Bay were strongly correlated with photosynthetic photon flux rather than seawater temperature. The concomitant decrease of LICF and P-max rates in all species examined argues against LICF playing a major role in carbon acquisition under light-limiting conditions as suggested previously. Rather, the strong positive correlation of P-max and LICF indicates the direct coupling of photosynthate (e.g. 3-phosphoglyceric acid) generation with production of substrates for LICF reactions. Our results also suggest that LICF might be a useful indicator of photosynthetic metabolism in marine macrophytes.

TI  - Hyperkeratosis of the teat duct orifice in the dairy cow
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Teat orifice hyperkeratosis, a commonly observed condition in dairy cows, has been considered a consequence of machine milking and the degree of hyperkeratosis may be increased by a poor milking system. A fully illustrated technique is described which uses a scoring system from 0 for a perfect orifice to 5 for an orifice significantly enlarged with extensively protruding fronds of teat duct keratin. A range of scores found in 25 commercial dairy herds is presented. The scores have been averaged for each cow and the markedly skewed distribution corrected by a square root transformation. This scoring procedure allows comparative measures of hyperkeratosis within and between herds. An 8-fold difference (0.17-1.31) in herd average score was found. Within all herds the score increased with lactational age of the animals and peaked, for any lactation, some 3-4 months post partum, declining as the animals dried off. There was no significant relationship between mean somatic cell count and degree of hyperkeratosis at the herd level. This implies that such chronic pathological changes are unlikely to be related to the level of intramammary infection. It appeared that some hyperkeratosis is an obvious and probably natural response to milking and occurs in a significant proportion of animals in all herds although often only to a slight degree. Much more hyperkeratosis may be a measure of the performance and management of the herd. The genetic influence is unknown. Higher yielding cows will score higher as they milk for longer, but generally high scores may reflect consistent and possibly considerable overmilking. Hyperkeratosis may be an indicator of the quality of management and show the level of attention being paid to the welfare of the herd.

AB  - Heavy metals and metalloids were measured in freshwater mussels (Hyridella menziesi) and sediments in the upper Waikato River, New Zealand. Mercury (Hg) concentrations ranged 35-fold in sediments (0.025-0.87 mg kg(-1) dry wt) and 144-fold in mussels (0.091-13.1 mg kg(-1) dry wt). Arsenic (As) concentrations ranged 190-fold in sediments (7.9-1520 mg kg(-1) dry wt) and only 10-fold in mussels (15.0-153 mg kg(-1) dry wt). There was no significant correlation between sediment total concentrations of either Hg or As and mussel tissue levels. Sediment quality guidelines were exceeded for Hg and As at most sites and for copper, chromium, iron and manganese at a few sites. Tissue concentrations exceeded levels considered to be safe for human consumption for Hg at Lake Aratiatia and As at several sites. Transplant experiments with caged mussels were used to measure uptake and depuration rates of Hg and As. Half-lives for mussel uptake and depuration of Hg were 6-12 months. Arsenic uptake rates could not be determined but the depuration showed a half-life of about 2.5 months. Physiological measurements were consistent with increased food availability at some sites rather than contaminant effects. These results highlight the need to understand biochemical changes induced by factors that are independent of environmental concentrations of contaminants, such as the influence of food levels and the potential for metabolic adaptation in biomonitoring organisms.

AB  - Climatic reconstructions from the delta D values of wood cellulose nitrate have been compromised because it is unclear whether the isotopic ratios are affected only by temperature or by temperature and humidity. To quantify the effect of humidity on the delta D values of leaf and wood cellulose nitrate, we grew avocados (Persea americana Mill. cv. Mexican) from seed at high and low humidities until they set wood. The source water for seed production was isotopically the same as the source water for seedling propagation. The delta D values of leaf cellulose nitrate were related to those of leaf water, which were, in turn, influenced by humidity (P < 0.01). The delta D values of wood cellulose nitrate were unrelated to those of leaf water or any other indicator of humidity, but were related to the delta D values of water in wood (P less than or equal to 0.05). The delta D values of wood cellulose nitrate were identical in three out of five pairs of low and high humidity treatments. These results suggest humidity cannot be reliably inferred from delta D values in wood cellulose nitrate. The delta D values of cellulose nitrate in both leaves and wood appear to have been influenced by the incorporation of stored metabolites into cellulose. Trees, like avocado seedlings, have considerable post-photosynthetic organic reserves that can be tapped for growth. Conditions that stimulate use of post-photosynthetic carbon reserves are varied for trees. Significant contributions from these reserves could lead to erroneous temperature inferences from delta D values of wood cellulose nitrate.

AB  - We have previously shown that a marine chlorophyte expressed flavodoxin under iron limitation but not under other nutrient stress conditions. Here we use polyclonal antiserum raised against the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin to show that a similar response is observed in this species. Using our antibody, western blotting techniques, and standard colorimetric detection (4-chloro-1-naphthol), we can detect at least a 25-50-fold increase in flavodoxin in iron-depleted compared to iron-replete cells. In iron-limited batch cultures of P. tricornutum, flavodoxin accumulation was inversely proportional to growth rate and was not detectable in cultures containing initially more than 750 nM of iron. We demonstrated that the accumulation of flavodoxin under iron stress is wide spread among marine diatoms and that it may be possible to use the presence or absence of flavodoxin in natural marine diatom assemblages to detect iron limitation. However, our polyclonal antisera appears to be specific for diatoms and did not cross-react with Synechococcus sp., Micromonas pusilla (Butcher) Manton et Parke, Dunaliella tertiolecta Butcher, Chlorella sp., Emiliania huxleii (Lohm.) Hay et Parke, or Isochrysis galbana Parke. A reverse bioassay experiment was conducted with natural phytoplankton assemblages containing mainly diatoms from Long Island Sound and in shelf waters near Cape Hatteras, two areas not suspected to be iron-limited. Although flavodoxin was not detected in situ in these areas, natural populations of diatoms driven into iron limitation expressed flavodoxin. Flavodoxin was detected in mats of the diatom Rhizosolenia castrecanei Cleve collected from the Equatorial Pacific during a JGOFS cruise in 1992, consistent with the hypothesis that iron may be limiting in this high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll region.

AB  - Permethrin (Pounce(R)) was applied at 70 g active ingredient per hectare by fixed-wing aircraft to a 16-ha jack and red pine plantation under application and meteorological conditions that were highly conducive for insecticide drift. Mortalities of an indicator aquatic insect species, Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae, and corresponding permethrin residues in shallow, artificial aquatic habitats, along with droplet densities on ground Kromekote(R) cards, were measured along five lines downwind and crosswind of the spray block. At 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 m downwind, larval mortalities averaged 40, 39, 51, 18, and 34%; permethrin residues averaged 1.4, 1.1, 1,2, 0.6, and 0.8 mug/L; and droplet densities averaged 25, 22, 17, 14, and 10 droplets per centimeter squared, respectively. At similar distances crosswind of the block, mortalities were 60, 53, 11, 1, and 0%; residues to 180 m were 1.6, 2.6, 1.1, and 0.3 mug/L; and droplet densities were 30, 22, 12, 2, and 0.1 droplets per centimeter squared, respectively. Mortalities and residues were not high for such shallow water (6.7 cm depth), particularly beyond 120 m, and were less than or similar to the values predicted from a swath-superposition model. Impact on sensitive aquatic arthropods and stream insects in deeper water (greater-than-or-equal-to 25 cm), more representative of natural habitats, is predicted to be insignificant at such distances. A buffer zone of 150 m around productive water bodies (depth greater-than-or-equal-to 25 cm) is suggested for aerial permethrin applications to such plantations.

AB  - The solid-solid reaction magnesiocarpholite = sudoite + quartz has been bracketed between 350 and 500-degrees-C, 6.3 and 7.8 kbar. Because it is impossible to synthesize end-member sudoite, all experiments were carried out using natural minerals as starting materials. Although mineral compositions were very close to those of the end-members, the effect of the fluorine content in carpholite was significant. Particularly in those experiments where sudoite grows at the expense of carpholite, electron microprobe analysis of the run products shows that a more stable F-rich carpholite crystallizes too, and consumes the fluorine released in solution by the breakdown of the original carpholite.
   Our experimental results are combined, through a thermodynamic analysis, with a previous data set and with previous experimental data concerning the relative stability of chlorite, talc and magnesiocarpholite with excess of quartz and water as a function of P-T and AlAl(SiMg)-1, substitutions in phyllosilicates. This allows us to constrain the feasible thermodynamic parameters (H(f)-degrees, sud; S-degrees sud) and (H(f,car)-degrees; S(car)-degrees)) for the Mg end-members. Using the partition coefficients calculated from natural parageneses, we have computed a petrogenetic grid for the system FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O. It demonstrates that parageneses involving sudoite and carpholite can be used as indicators of P-T conditions, up to 600-degrees-C, 8 kbar for sudoite, and at higher pressure for carpholite.

AB  - The global pandemic of COVID-19 has been insisted by many countries in the world to implement social distancing, including Indonesia. This research measured the environmental impact before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Variables, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of Sentinel-5P Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (Tropomi), nighttime light condition of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) and land surface temperature (LST) of Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), were monitored using the cloud-based computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE). This study found that all monitored variables decreased during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period before the pandemic. However, the pattern of reduction of NO2 concentration and nighttime light was not observed to be coherent with large-scale social distancing regulation enforced by the government. This study found that the reduction has begun 2 months earlier than the official regulation enforced by the government. The lower LST shown in both the time-series map and the graph demonstrated changes before and during the pandemic. The hypothesis was tested using the t-test method, and the statistical results show the significant difference between two groups of observed variables (e.g. before and during the pandemic) with the lower p-values and higher Cohen's d. Results of this study indicate that it should be feasible to monitor the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using the combination of NO2 concentration, nighttime light and LST information as a proxy.

AB  - Variations in the airborne pollen load are among the current and expected impacts on plant pollination driven by climate change. Due to the potential risk for pollen-allergy sufferers, this study aimed to analyze the trends of the three most abundant spring-tree pollen types, Pinus, Platanus and Quercus, and to evaluate the possible influence of meteorological conditions. An aerobiological study was performed during the 1993-2020 period in the Ourense city (NW Spain) by means of a Hirst-type volumetric sampler. Meteorological data were obtained from the 'Ourense' meteorological station of METEOGALICIA. We found statistically significant trends for the Total Pollen in all cases. The positive slope values indicated an increase in pollen grains over the pollen season along the studied years, ranging from an increase of 107 to 442 pollen grains. The resulting C5.0 Decision Trees and Rule-Based Models coincided with the Spearman's correlations since both statistical analyses showed a strong and positive influence of temperature and sunlight on pollen release and dispersal, as well as a negative influence of rainfall due to washout processes. Specifically, we found that slight rainfall and moderate temperatures promote the presence of Pinus pollen in the atmosphere and a marked effect of the daily thermal amplitude on the presence of high Platanus pollen levels. The percentage of successful predictions of the C5.0 models ranged between 62.23-74.28%. The analysis of long-term datasets of pollen and meteorological information provides valuable models that can be used as an indicator of potential allergy risk in the short term by feeding the obtained models with weather prognostics.

AB  - The global e-waste generation is projected to leap tremendously over the following years due to the fast urbanization and increasing population. Inadequate management and uncontrolled disposal may impact significantly to the health and environment. E-waste could become a significant source of precious metals at the end of e-waste life. The recovery of precious metals from e-waste provides a sustainable solution; however, conventional hydrometallurgical approach bears a greater fraction of environmental concerns and energy utilization. In this study, effort has been given to recover palladium (Pd(II)) from ceramic capacitor using solvent-ligand process with a focus on environmental sustainability. The use of 3-(((5-ethoxybenzenethiol)imino)methyl)-salicylic acid as a ligand to recover Pd(II) from ceramic capacitor was investigated. The effects of different variables such as, contact time and reaction temperature, leaching kinetics as well as the environmental assessment of synthesis process were examined. The high purity of Pd(II)was recovered from ceramic capacitor under optimized condition, as evident from XRD and XPS analysis. The formation of [Pd(II)-ligand](n+) complexes was attributed to the recovery of pure metallic Pd(II). The environmental assessment measured from Biwer and Heinzle Method (BHM) indicated that the solvent-legend approach for recovering Pd(II)is associated with the lower impact on the environment compared with the other process. The results open up a sustainable recovery of precious metals contributing to the circular economy.

AB  - Metropolitan areas in Andean industrialized valleys with a strong geomorphological structure and a pronounced climate experience an increasing degradation of air quality, which motivates environmental policies that include the expansion of tree coverage in urban areas among the mitigation measures. Using the metropolitan area of the Aburra Valley, Colombia, as a study case, we evaluate the removal of PM2.5 by urban trees with the Urban Forest Effects (UFORE) methodology, considering the potential effect of changing tree covers in the valley for several projected meteorological conditions under climate change and different urban management practices. The estimated removals are sensitive to the number and distribution of available ground stations, with a tendency to overestimate with fewer stations. We found that the marginal gains in removal by additional tree plantings are low in the urbanized settings. In the environmental scenarios, the main limiting factor in the removal is precipitation, compared to changes in tree cover and levels of pollution. Spatially, the increase in total removal depends on the increase in tree cover, with more benefits obtained when trees are in areas with high concentrations of PM2.5. Trees with low values of leaf area index (LAI) seem to optimize the effectiveness of the removal. Seasonally, the greatest removal occurs in rainy months when pollution levels are the highest. Based on our results, the scenarios that meet the plans and programs aimed at improving air quality would achieve removal effectiveness of around 2.5% of the total emissions of PM2.5 with urban trees. Air quality would achieve removal effectiveness of around 2.5% of the total emissions of PM2.5 with urban trees.

AB  - The prevalence of ooids in the stratigraphic record, and their association with shallow-water carbonate environments, make ooids an important paleoenvironmental indicator. Recent advances in the theoretical understanding of ooid morphology, along with empirical studies from Turks and Caicos, Great Salt Lake, and The Bahamas, have demonstrated that the morphology of ooids is indicative of depositional environment and hydraulic conditions. To apply this knowledge from modern environments to the stratigraphic record of Earth's history, researchers measure the size and shape of lithified ooids on two-dimensional surfaces (i.e., thin sections), often assuming that random 2D slices intersect the nuclei and that the orientation of the ooids is known. Here, we demonstrate that these assumptions rarely are true, resulting in errors of up to 35% for metrics like major axis length. We present a method for making 3D reconstructions by serial grinding and imaging, which enables accurate measurement of the morphology of individual ooids within an oolite, as well as the sorting and porosity of a sample. We also provide three case studies that use the morphology of ooids in oolites to extract environmental information. Each case study demonstrates that 2D measurements can be useful if the environmental signal is large relative to the error from 2D measurements. However, 3D measurements substantially improve the accuracy and precision of environmental interpretations. This study focuses on oolites, but errors from 2D measurements are not unique to oolites; this method can be used to extract accurate grain and porosity measurements from any coherent, granular sample.

AB  - The purpose of the research is to study the effect of feeding an active coal feed supplement (ACFS) on biological fish-breeding indicators of young fish grown in closed water supply plants. The experiment was conducted in the conditions of a sturgeon farm in the Krasnodar territory. The object of the research was juvenile ship sturgeon Acipenser nudiventris Lovetsky, 1828. The traditional technology of keeping and feeding sturgeon fish with combined starter feeds in closed-cycle plants was used in the experiments. The physical and chemical properties of water and the content of chemical and toxic substances in sturgeon feed were analyzed. We studied the influence of feeding with ACFS on biological fish-breeding parameters, growth rate, survival rate, feed spending, nutrient products, and the coefficient of the fatness of sturgeon juveniles. We also checked the influence of active coal feed supplements on the development of muscle tissue, the chemical body composition of young fish, and its heavy metals content. We established that all water indicators in the closed water supply system were stable during the experiment and met the existing requirements. We registered that the use of ACFS in feeding young sturgeon fish contributes to an increase in their weight by 5.310.2%, the fatness coefficient - by 1.7-7.5% and a reduction in feed-cost products - by 5.0-8.9%. The use of ACFS has a positive effect on the development of muscle tissue, increasing its protein content by 0.41-0.42%, fat-by 0.16-0.32%, and reduces the content of heavy metals in the body of young sturgeon by 1.5-2.0 times.

AB  - The possibility of activating adaptive processes and organism resistance of cattle on commercial dairy farms under the influence of biological stimulants (polystim and PV-1) is proved.
   Biostimulants reduced the risk of gynecological disorders in cows: they reduced the retention time of placenta and subinvolution of uterus, reduced the endometritis and mastitis occurrence; increased reproductive function: shortened the time of the first estrus coming, increased the fertility, reduced the conception rate and duration of the service period, and improved the physicochemical composition of colostrum.
   The used biostimulants contributed to the increase in live weight of calves while increasing the relatively high level of assimilative processes associated with the fact that their forage energy was mainly spent on increasing body weight. At the same time, in calves not injected with biological preparations, it was mainly spent on providing homeothermia (i.e., maintaining constant body temperature), which was especially evident at low external temperatures.
   In calves raised in the conditions of intensive technology in winter, after the administration of dostim and polystim, the following indicators were significantly higher: the phagocytic activity of leukocytes by 5.4% - 6.4%, the lysozyme activity of plasma - by 3.0% - 6.2%, the blood serum bactericidal activity - by 7.1% - 9.5% and the content of immunoglobulins - by 2.5 mg/ml - 3.1 mg/ml.
   With the adaptive technology, the data of these indicators were higher: in winter period - by 5.2 - 6.4%, 3.1 - 6.2%, 6.0 - 8.7% and 4.7 - 5.7 mg/ml; and in spring-summer period - by 0.2 - 0.6%, 4.6 - 5.7%, 4.9 - 7.2% and 3.4 - 4.8 mg/ml (P<0.05-0.001), respectively.

AB  - Introduction: Brazil is in the 19th position of priority countries for the control of TB/HIV coinfection, so we aimed to analyze the social and health services contexts that are associated with TB/HIV coinfection in SAo Paulo state.
   Methodology: Ecological study conducted in 645 cities of the state. The study population consisted of 10,389 new cases of TB/HIV coinfection in state residents between 2010 and 2015. The variables and indicators used in the study were collected from secondary sources. To identify the factors associated with the occurrence of TB/HIV coinfection cases, generalized additive models for location, scale and shape were used. The best distribution model was defined from the lowest Akaike information criterion value.
   Results: There was an association between the occurrence of coinfection and the diagnosis of TB after death and greater treatment default. There was also an association with greater coverage of nurses and Family Health Strategy, which comprises Primary Care settings focused on families. Regarding the social context, the Gini Coefficient of inequality was identified as a determinant of coinfection.
   Conclusions: The study presents the complexity of TB/HIV coinfection, proposing critical points in the health services and social context. Despite the high coverage of nurses and Family Health Strategy in some cities, this did not affect the reduction of the incidence of coinfection. These findings may be attributed to a fragmented care and focused on acute conditions. Furthermore, this model of care holds few prospects for care integration or prioritization of prevention and health promotion actions.

AB  - Standard N fertilizer rates for corn (Zea mays L.) production are often based on yield goal and a simplified N factor. Unfortunately, simplified systems generally ignore management history that affects soil health condition. We analyzed economic return to N fertilizer investment using a soil-test biological activity (STBA)-based approach compared with current approaches in the United States, and specifically in North Carolina (NC) and Virginia (VA). The STBA-based approach addressed management history on 99 fields through cumulative effects on biological activity as an indicator of soil health. Economically optimum N fertilizer rate was determined for each field from replicated, small-plot trials with four N rates applied to corn at sidedress and using four levels of cost-to-value threshold (CVT; i.e., 5, 10, 15, and 20 kg grain kg(-1) N). Economic return was often greater using the STBA-based method compared with current recommendation systems (US$4.10 +/- 4.96 ha(-1), $23.63 +/- 5.30 ha(-1), $49.36 +/- 5.63 ha(-1), and $83.22 +/- 6.81 ha(-1) with low, medium, high, and very high CVTs, respectively; mean +/- standard error). Greater STBA led to greater economic return (i.e., $0.03 ha(-1) [p = .58], $0.23 ha(-1) [p < .001], $0.28 ha(-1) [p < .001], and $0.33 ha(-1) [p < .001] for every unit increase in STBA [mg kg(-1)] at low, medium, high, and very high CVTs, respectively). Farmers can increase profit by adopting soil-health building practices and adjusting N fertilizer inputs in their nutrient management plan in response to conserved nutrient cycling in the biologically active organic fraction.

AB  - Application of a set of electrical methods used in geophysics-direct current resistance and induced polarization-for the purposes of mapping soil heterogeneity is considered. In the field, we measured the parameters of specific electrical resistance (SER) and induced polarization (IP) of shungite soils of the Zaonezhskii Peninsula (Republic of Karelia) using the A-M-N-B electrode installation with spacings of 15 cm. To ensure the interpretation adequacy, the relative soil water content and the soil texture were determined. Using the map of resistivity values, spatial variations in the soil water content and, partially, in the soil texture were estimated. The map of IP values was used to find out spatial variations in the composition of soils, including, in particular, the content of shungite. The analysis of the correlative dependence of the electrophysical parameters on the soil water content showed that the Spearman coefficient r(s) is -0.426 for SER and 0.076 for IP, which confirms the hypothesis about different levels of influence of the water content on these parameters. In the course of studying the influence of the frequency of the generated electric signal, an increase in the IP intensity was found in the frequency range of 0.01-0.1 Hz for the soils with elevated carbon content. The analysis of soil samples demonstrated that the IP anomalies within the studied area may be related to variations both in the soil texture and in the shungite material content. Hence, the electrophysical indicators determined under natural conditions can be applied to characterize the spatial variations in soil water content, soil texture, and some structural properties of the soils.

AB  - Conductivity is a very reliable, sensitive, and easily obtained indicator of surface water conditions; however, whether it could be used to evaluate lake pollution is less understood. To verify the effectiveness of using conductivity to evaluate the pollution status in lakes, Lake Taihu was analyzed, the third largest freshwater lake in China, which provides drinking water to about 10 million of residents. We analyzed 25-year conductivity data in 32 sampling sites in Lake Taihu, in relation to human population, industrial development, and GDP. The results showed that the conductivity first increased and then decreased following rapid economic growth and subsequent strict pollution control activities. The conductivity is related to industrial sewage (r = 0.90); SO42- and Cl- concentrations in the water were closely related to the industrial production value (r = 0.98, 0.99) before 2007. The conductivity increased rapidly from 1992 to 2007 due to eutrophication processes. After 2007, with the implementation of various pollution control measures, the pollution situation gradually abated. The conductivity was closely related to the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus (r = 0.53, 0.14) in Lake Taihu, which suggests that conductivity could be indicator of eutrophication in lakes to some extent. Based on the research results, conductivity can largely be used to characterize the impact of human activities on lakes. Our study suggests that conductivity is a very reliable parameter for evaluating lake pollution. In addition to providing ion information, this measurement could successfully determine pollution sources and restoration effectiveness in lakes, such as ecologically complex Lake Taihu.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes are re-emerging in countries where the popularity of free-range poultry production systems is increasing. Amongst all gastrointestinal nematodes, Ascaridia galli is of significant concern due to the parasite's direct life cycle and ability to survive extreme environmental conditions. In laying hens, A. galli parasites have been associated with reduced health, welfare, immunity, and egg production. Direct losses are caused by obstruction and damage of the intestinal tract in hens when high worm burdens are present. These result in reduction in egg production and body weight of infected laying hens, consequently leading to significant economic losses for farmers. Furthermore, heavy infections with A. galli may lead to increased mortality within the flock. Indirect losses are due to suppression of immune system function which can increase susceptibility to secondary infections. Infection with A. galli can also alter nutrient utilization and absorption. Levels of anti- A. galli serum and egg yolk antibodies increase following A. galli infection. Elevated antibodies can be used as an indicator of current or previous infections and therefore can be used as a diagnostic tool. The impact of A. galli on hen health and welfare manifests through the depletion of liver lipid reserves and increased use of energy reserves to mount immune responses against the parasite. This review highlights the variable effects of A. galli infection on the performance, health, egg quality, and emphasizes especially on immune responses of free-range laying hens as well as it evaluates various potential detection methods and preventive and control measures of this parasitic disease.

AB  - Ammonia-oxidixing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) mediate the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification and are responsive to agricultural management practices. These two attributes make them ideal indicators of biological soil health. We conducted a laboratory incubation study to determine their response to elevated levels of zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in poultry litter treated soil at three substrate concentrations: 0 (low), 50 (medium) and 100 (high) mg ammonium (NH4+-N) kg(-1) soil. Nitrification potential (NP) was measured to characterize changes in their function in which 1-octyne was used to separate their contributions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure their abundance by targeting amoA. Increasing Zn from 21 to 250 mg kg-1 resulted in large reductions in AOB (78%) and AOA (85%) abundance at the high NH4+ level over 28 days. Likewise, increasing Cu from 20 to 120 mg kg(-1) significantly reduced AOB (92%) and AOA (63%) abundance at the high NHthorn 4 level over 28 days. The relative contribution of AOB to NP was significantly higher than that of AOA in both Zn (similar to 60%) and Cu (similar to 70%) treated soils despite the numerical dominance of AOA over AOB. Overall, results indicate that elevated levels of Zn and Cu depressed AOB and AOA abundance and function and that their effect was dependent on availability of NH4+. The results also indicated that AOB are functionally more important than AOA under elevated Zn and Cu concentrations and that management practices to improve N use efficiency should focus on AOB under this condition.

AB  - In this study the variability of greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentrations along lateral and vertical dimensions of the chalk aquifer located in the eastern part of Belgium was examined in order to understand its dependence on hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical conditions. Groundwater samples from 29 wells/piezometers were analyzed for concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), major and minor elements and stable isotopes of nitrate (NO3-), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfate (SO42-) and boron (B). For lateral investigations, four zones with different environmental settings were identified (southern, central, north-eastern and northern). Groundwater was oversaturated with GHGs with respect to its equilibrium concentrations with the atmosphere in all zones, except the northern one, undersaturated in N2O (0.07 +/- 0.08 mu gN/L vs. 0.3 mu gN/L). Vertical dimension studies showed the decrease in CO2 concentration and significant changes in both isotope signatures and concentration of N2O with depth. The production of N2O could be attributed to a combination of nitrification and denitrification processes occurring at different depths. CO2 concentration is controlled by the process of dissolution of carbonate minerals which constitute aquifer geology. CH4 is produced due to metha-nogenesis in deeper parts of the aquifer, though its thermogenic origin is also possible. Differences in hydrogeochemical settings and changing intensity of biogeochemical processes across the area and with depth have considerable effect on GHGs concentrations. Thus, before estimating GHGs fluxes at the groundwater-river interface insights obtained from larger-scale investigations are required in order to identify the representative spatial zones which govern GHGs emissions.

AB  - Small variations of relief may change drainage and runoff and hence promote the formation of sandy surface horizons and hardened subsurface horizons (fragipans and/or duripans) in Coastal Tablelands soils. This study aimed to investigate the pedogenesis on Coastal Tablelands area with low range altimetry in Paraiba state; secondly, we also sought to contribute to the improvement of the Brazilian Soil Classification System (BSCS). Four soil profiles ware described and collected to be submitted to routine physical and chemical analysis, determination of Fe, Al and Si extracted by sulfuric acid digestion, sodium citrate - bicarbonate-dithionite and acid ammonium oxalate, sodium pyrophosphate, and mineralogical analysis in the sand and clay fractions by X-ray diffractometry. Optical density of the oxalate extract (ODOE) was also determined; the results were statistically evaluated using the R software. Microrelief variations conditioning differentiated water flows, along with the sandy texture of the surface horizons (A and E) and the lower coarse sand/fine sand ratio in the subsurface horizon, seem to promote clay accumulation in depth in the Spodosols developed on Coastal Tablelands environments. For this soils, the argilluvic (argissolico) character at the subgroup level of the BSCS should be incorporated. In addition, Al amorphous mineral phases and/or poorly crystalline play an important role in the formation of strongly cemented horizons (duripans) of the Spodosols, as also reported by other authors. Finally, the ODOE showed to be an efficient indicator of soils under podzolization process, being possible its use as a taxonomic criterion for classification of Spodosols by the BSCS.

AB  - This paper represents an economic study of the main soil types in West region of Romania for various agricultural crops. Studying the economic efficiency of soil is important because according to it we can draw conclusions about the effectiveness and profitability of crops. Knowing bonitary marks we could find natural production potential of soils for wheat, corn, and sun-flower crops. Economic comparison was obtained by multiplying production by the price/ kg practiced in the summer of 2016. In this way we can see on one side which is more profitable crops listed and, on the other hand, if we get the best return on the type of soil that culture. We can also draw conclusions about the profitability of different crops established on soil types studied. In this work we were studied five different soil types located in the western part of Romania. The soil analyses were made on Laboratory from Soil Science Department from Faculty of Agriculture on Timisoara. The obtained results were compared with the Romanian Pedological Studies Elaborating Methodology, 1987. The conditional evaluation of land for natural conditions, each of the above indicators involved in determining the mark of evaluation of evaluation by a coefficient which varies between 0 and 1 as that is totally bad ownership or usage or optimal requirements of the plant considered. Note the uses of evaluation and culture product obtained by multiplying by 100 coefficients of the 17 indicators directly involved in establishing evaluation notes: Y = (x1, x2, x3... x17) x 100, where: Y - soil evaluation mark; x1, x2, x3,., x17 = coefficients value (17 indicators).

AB  - Vibrio species are marine bacteria that occur in estuaries worldwide; many are virulent human pathogens with high levels of antibiotic resistance. The average annual incidence of all Vibrio infections has increased by 41% between 1996 and 2005. V. vulnificus (Vv), a species associated with shellfish and occurring in the US Southeast, has ranges of temperature (16-33 degrees C) and salinity (5-20ppt) dependencies for optimal growth. Increased water temperatures caused by atmospheric warming and increased salinity gradients caused by sea level rise raise concerns for the effect of climate change on the geographic range of Vv and the potential for increased exposure risk. This research combined monthly field sampling, laboratory analysis, and modeling to identify the current occurrence of Vv in the Winyah Bay estuary (South Carolina, USA) and assess the possible effects of climate change on future geographic range and exposure risk in the estuary. Vv concentrations ranged from 0 to 58 colony forming units (CFU)/mL, salinities ranged from 0 to 28ppt, and temperature from 18 to 31 degrees C. A significant empirical relationship was found between Vv concentration and salinity and temperature that fit well with published optimal ranges for growth for these environmental parameters. These results, when coupled with an existing model of future specific conductance, indicated that sea level rise has a greater impact on exposure risk than temperature increases in the estuary. Risk increased by as much as four times compared to current conditions with the largest temporally widespread increase at the most upriver site where currently there is minimal risk.

AB  - In the last decade, the consumption trend of organic food has increased dramatically worldwide. However, the lack of reliable chemical markers to discriminate between organic and conventional products makes this market susceptible to food fraud in products labeled as "organic". Metabolomic fingerprinting approach has been demonstrated as the best option for a full characterization of metabolome occurring in plants, since their pattern may reflect the impact of both endogenous and exogenous factors. In the present study, advanced technologies based on high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRAMS) has been used for marker search in organic and conventional tomatoes grown in greenhouse under controlled agronomic conditions. The screening of unknown compounds comprised the retrospective analysis of all tomato samples throughout the studied period and data processing using databases (mzCloud, ChemSpider and PubChem). In addition, stable nitrogen isotope analysis (delta N-15) was assessed as a possible indicator to support discrimination between both production systems using crop/fertilizer correlations. Pesticide residue analyses were also applied as a well-established way to evaluate the organic production. Finally, the evaluation by combined chemometric analysis of high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS) and delta N-15 data provided a robust classification model in accordance with the agricultural practices. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a sample clustering according to farming systems and significant differences in the sample profile was observed for six bioactive components (L-tyrosyl-L-isoleucyl-L-threonyl-L-threonine, trilobatin, phloridzin, tomatine, phloretin and echinenone).

AB  - This data article provides macroeconomic data that can be used to generate macroeconomic volatility. The data cover a sample of seven selected countries in the Asia Pacific region for the period 2004-2014, including both developing and developed countries. This dataset was generated to enhance our understanding of the sources of macroeconomic volatility affecting the countries in this region. Although the Asia Pacific region continues to remain as the most dynamic part of the world's economy, it is not spared from various sources of macroeconomic volatility through the decades. The reported data cover 15 types of macroeconomic data series, representing three broad categories of indicators that can be used to proxy macroeconomic volatility. They are indicators that account for macroeconomic volatility (i.e. volatility as a macroeconomic outcome), domestic sources of macroeconomic volatility and external sources of macroeconomic volatility. In particular, the selected countries are Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines, which are regarded as developing countries, while Singapore, Japan and Australia are developed countries. Despite the differences in level of economic development, these countries were affected by similar sources of macroeconomic volatility such as the Asian Financial Crisis and the Global Financial Crisis. These countries were also affected by other similar external turbulence arising from factors such as the global economic slowdown, geopolitical risks in the Middle East and volatile commodity prices. Nonetheless, there were also sources of macroeconomic volatility which were peculiar to certain countries only. These were generally domestic sources of volatility such as political instability (for Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines), natural disasters and anomalous weather conditions (for Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Japan and Australia) and over-dependence on the electronic sector (for Singapore).

AB  - Information on the detection of pesticides in fresh water Lakes of Kashmir (Dal and Mansbal) through GC-MS technique is scarce, and also the recovery in biochemical parameters (AST, ALT and ALP) of fish after transferring them to clean media has not been reported yet. The water samples were collected from three sites and analyzed for their pesticide profile by dispersive liquid-liquid micro extraction (DLLME) followed by GC-MS. Influence of pesticides on liver marker enzymes of Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius was also investigated. The results obtained showed the presence of three main pesticides viz. chlorpyrifros, dimethoate and dichlorvos in waters of Dal Lake whereas no pesticide was detected in waters of Mansbal. The higher values for AST, ALT and ALP activities and decrease in protein content were obtained in the samples from the Dal Lake compared with those from Mansbal Lake (p < 0.05). These data when compared with the values found in C. carpio and C. carassius from both the Dal Lake and Mansbal Lake kept under laboratory conditions after 15, 30, 45 and 60 days of maintenance in clean media found that during depuration, all the enzyme activities came down significantly (p < 0.05) indicating the compensatory response by the fish against the pesticide stress. Therefore, these parameters could be used as indicators of pesticide pollution in aquatic organisms and were recommended for environmental monitoring for investigating the mechanism involved in the recovery pattern.

AB  - This study examined the potential of using a novel bulk amine assay as an approximation for the tertiary and quaternary amine load in wastewaters and surface water samples, and this approximation was compared to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential using chloramines. An existing colorimetric method was examined and optimized for the detection of amines in environmental water samples. The method consists of liquid-liquid extraction followed by a catalyzed reaction to form a yet undefined product that is known to be both a strong chromophore and fluorophore. Previous work verified that this reaction was effectively catalyzed by a number of compounds containing tertiary and quaternary amine moieties. Many tertiary and quaternary compounds are also efficient producers of NDMA under chloramination conditions, and a linear correlation was consequently derived from the bulk amine signals vs. NDMA formation potential in various wastewater samples (R-2 = 0.74; n = 24; p-value < 0.05). The results provide evidence that approximately 2% of the tertiary and quaternary amines measured can form NDMA and an estimated 0.01-1.3% of nitrogen in dissolved organic nitrogen originates from these bulk amines. The normalization of NDMA concentration by the amine measurement revealed that ozone effectively destroyed those tertiary and quaternary amine structures more likely to form NDMA in treated wastewater samples. This bulk amine assay illustrates that proxy measurements of tertiary and quaternary amines can be linked to the NDMA formation potential of a given sample, and this approach may prove useful as a characterizing tool for NDMA precursors in wastewater.

AB  - Photodegradation is an important abiotic degradation process to be taken into account for more accurate assessment of the fate of chemicals in the aquatic environment, especially those that are not readily biodegradable. Although the significant role of indirect photodegradation in the environmental fate of chemicals has been revealed in recent research, because of the many confounding factors affecting its kinetics, no straightforward approaches can be used to investigate this degradation process for environmental fate assessment. The indirect photodegradation of a fragrance ingredient named Pamplewood was studied in this work for its fate assessment. Indirect photodegradation rates under various indoor and outdoor conditions were measured by using an LC-MS method. Although the half-lives varied from 4 to 13 days, they collectively indicated that Pamplewood is intrinsically photolabile and can undergo rapid photodegradation. Results from quencher experiments revealed that center dot OH was the main reactive intermediate responsible for indirect photodegradation, with a half-life of about 18 days in sunlit surface water, based on the experimentally determined second-order rate constant (8.48 +/- 0.19 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1)). Photodegradation products of Pamplewood were also studied by GC-MS, LC-MS and total organic carbon content analyses. The results indicated that intermediates of Pamplewood photodegradation continued to photodegrade into smaller and more polar species. Complete mineralization of Pamplewood was observed when it was reacted with hydroxyl radicals in an aqueous solution. This novel approach can be applied for a more realistic environmental fate assessment of other non-readily biodegradable, hydrolysis-resistant, and non-sunlight-absorbing fragrance ingredients.

AB  - 1. Global environmental change can dramatically alter the composition of floral and faunal communities, and elucidating the mechanisms underlying this process is important for predicting its outcomes. Studies on global climate change have mostly focused on statistical summaries within wide spatial and temporal scales; less attention has been paid to variability in microclimates at narrower spatial and temporal scales.
   2. The microclimate is the suite of climatic conditions measured in a local area. Environmental variables at the microclimatic scale can be critical for the ecology of organisms inhabiting each area. The effect of spatial and temporal changes in the microclimate on the ecology of carabid beetle communities in three sites on Mount Odaesan, Korea was examined.
   3. Carabid beetle communities and quantified site-specific environmental factors from measurements of air temperature, air humidity, light intensity and soil temperature over 5 years (2010-2015) were surveyed.
   4. It was found that microclimatic variables and the patterns of temporal changes in carabid beetle communities differed between the three sites within the single mountain system. Microclimatic variables influencing temporal changes in beetle communities also differed between the sites. Therefore, it is suggested that variation in local microclimates affects spatial and temporal variation in carabid beetle communities at a local scale.
   5. The present results demonstrate the importance of regular surveys of communities at local scales. Such surveys are expected to reveal an additional fraction of variation in communities and underlying processes that have been overlooked in studies of global community patterns and change.

AB  - Field experiments on crop weediness were carried out at Vezaiciai Branch of Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry during the period 2010-2014. The study was conducted in the long-term naturally acid and limed Bathygleyic Distric Glossic Retisol formed on medium-moraine loam. The study was aimed to determine the weed variation tendencies in acid soils after liming and fertilizing with different organic fertilizers.
   A long-term fertilization with farmyard manure and organic fertilizers unequally affected the amount of weeds and their mass in crops of the rotation. During the stage of shooting, weed germination was more intense and the number of weeds was greater by 15% than in the stage of maturity. After liming, the amount of mobile Al decreased and the weed number decreased by 17%. Significant impact of liming on the weed number was determined in stands of winter wheat and spring barley. In the stage of shooting, organic fertilization did not have significant influence on weediness indicators (weed number and number of weed species).
   Due to unequal nutrition and growth conditions of weeds in limed soil in the stage of crop maturity, the weed number and their mass decreased, respectively by 30.7% and 58.7% compared to unlimed soil. Organic fertilizers differently affected the weediness of crops of the rotation. The most significant effect of organic fertilizers was in the second year of use and in the fourth year the differences were insignificant. In the treatments fertilized with farmyard manure the weed number and mass were lower for the first two years. The use of the green manure on the background of different farmyard manure rates increased weed number in crops of the rotation.

AB  - Behavioral economic measures of demand provide estimates of tobacco product abuse liability and may predict effects of policy-related price regulation on consumption of existing and emerging tobacco products.
   In the present study, we examined demand for snus, a smokeless tobacco product, in comparison to both cigarettes and medicinal nicotine. We used both a naturalistic method in which participants purchased these products for use outside the laboratory, as well as laboratory-based self-administration procedures.
   Cigarette smokers (N = 42) used an experimental income to purchase their usual brand of cigarettes and either snus or gum (only one product available per session) across a range of prices, while receiving all products they purchased from one randomly selected price. In a separate portion of the study, participants self-administered these products during laboratory-based, progressive ratio sessions.
   Demand elasticity (sensitivity of purchasing to price) was significantly greater for snus than cigarettes. Elasticity for gum was intermediate between snus and cigarettes but was not significantly different than either. Demand intensity (purchasing unconstrained by price) was significantly lower for gum compared to cigarettes, with no significant difference observed between snus and cigarettes. Results of the laboratory-based, progressive ratio sessions were generally discordant with measures of demand elasticity, with significantly higher "breakpoints" for cigarettes compared to gum and no significant differences between other study products. Moreover, breakpoints and product purchasing were generally uncorrelated across tasks.
   Under naturalistic conditions, snus appears more sensitive to price manipulation than either cigarettes or nicotine gum in existing smokers.

AB  - A literature search was conducted to summarize studies that quantified the efficacy of ballast water exchange. Here, a number of parameters were collated from 68 studies to provide a meta-analysis of the efficacy of exchange. The percent removal of ballast water, organisms, and various physical parameters was investigated to quantify exchange efficacy in terms of volumetric, biological, and water quality measurements, respectively. The two types of exchanges implemented-empty-refill and flow-through-demonstrated 66 to >99% efficiencies of volumetric exchange when this factor was measured using rhodamine dye as a tracer. Of the reports and papers reviewed, zooplankton were the most common biological parameter studied, and nearly all data showed a decrease in concentrations following exchange, although the changes in community structure varied. Additional biological parameters reported were the concentrations of protists, bacteria, and virus-like particles (VLPs). Results of protist studies were highly variable-ranging from a decrease in cell concentrations to an increase following exchange-while bacteria and VLPs concentrations showed no change in most cases. Of course, the diversity and physiological condition of organisms in ballast water can cause differences in responses that may lead to inconsistencies when determining if organisms were removed during exchange. Additionally, organisms present in sediment may also repopulate ballast water following exchange. In contrast to the biological results, some water quality parameters, such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and trace elements (e.g., barium and manganese), were consistent indicators of exchange. In conclusion, although the volumetric efficacy of exchange showed, in most studies, that the majority of the water was removed from the tanks, biological and most water quality parameters did not show a consistent response to exchange.

AB  - This study analyzes effects of soil and water conservation (SWC) on soil quality and implications to climate change adaptation and mitigation in the Upper Blue Nile River Basin of Ethiopia by using the Anjeni watershed as a case study site. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from two sub-watersheds of Anjeni: the Minchet sub-watershed (with SWC measures) and the Zikrie sub-watershed (without SWC measures). Soil samples were taken from 30-cm depth from five representative landscape positions and analyzed following the standard soil lab analysis procedures. The results show that soils from the conserved sub-watershed had improved quality indicators compared with those from the non-conserved site. Significant improvement due to SWC measures was observed in the soil hydrological [total moisture content (+543%), field capacity (+535%), and available water capacity (+418%)] and chemical [cation exchange capacity (+440cmol(+)kg(-1)), Mg2+ (+190cmol(+)kg(-1)), Na+ (+010cmol(+)kg(-1))] properties. SWC interventions significantly reduced soil erosion by 57-81% and surface runoff by 19-50% in the conserved sub-watershed. Reduction in soil erosion can maintain the soil organic carbon stock, reduce the land degradation risks, and enhance the C sequestration potential of soils. Therefore, adoption of SWC measures can increase farmers' ability to offset emissions and adapt to climate change. However, SWC measures that are both protective and sufficiently productive have not yet been implemented in the conserved sub-watershed. Therefore, it is important that SWC structures be supplemented with other biological and agronomic measures in conjunction with soil fertility amendments appropriate to site-specific conditions.

AB  - Soil physical quality (SPQ) can be assessed by different experimental methodologies and criteria and the optimal/critical values or ranges for SPQ indicators are still approximate. Sampling soils with minimal anthropic pressures should allow improvements in SPQ assessment. Different experimental methodologies and criteria were applied to sample a Mediterranean oak forest (Quercus ilex L.) and pasture land, in Sicily, with a varying degree of anthropic disturbance. Soil water retention was determined in the laboratory and the field, using the BEST (Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters) procedure of soil hydraulic characterization. Capacity-based indicators, the S index, and location and shape parameters of the pore volume distribution function were calculated for assessing SPQ. With the laboratory data, only the criterion using the capacity-based indicators suggested that SPQ increased as external pressures decreased. Therefore, this criterion appeared to be more reliable than the other tested criteria in the sampled environment. The field method was more prone to suggest good conditions and less able to signal differences between plots as compared with the laboratory method. A forest soil with a good SPQ has an ability to store and provide water to plant roots similar to, but it is more aerated than, a good agricultural soil. Developing BEST for SPQ assessment is advisable since parameters descriptive of the soil water transport properties can be collected with a single experiment. Simultaneous characterization of dendrometric and soil parameters at other sites is recommended to explore the relationships between SPQ indicators and characteristics of the forest cover.

AB  - We examine the relationship between the mean and the variability of Arctic sea-ice coverage and volume in a large range of climates from globally ice-covered to globally ice-free conditions. Using a hierarchy of two column models and several comprehensive Earth system models, we consolidate the results of earlier studies and show that mechanisms found in simple models also dominate the interannual variability of Arctic sea ice in complex models. In contrast to predictions based on very idealised dynamical systems, we find a consistent and robust decrease of variance and autocorrelation of sea-ice volume before summer sea ice is lost. We attribute this to the fact that thinner ice can adjust more quickly to perturbations. Thereafter, the autocorrelation increases, mainly because it becomes dominated by the ocean water's large heat capacity when the ice-free season becomes longer. We show that these changes are robust to the nature and origin of climate variability in the models and do not depend on whether Arctic sea-ice loss occurs abruptly or irreversibly. We also show that our climate is changing too rapidly to detect reliable changes in autocorrelation of annual time series. Based on these results, the prospects of detecting statistical early warning signals before an abrupt sea-ice loss at a "tipping point" seem very limited. However, the robust relation between state and variability can be useful to build simple stochastic climate models and to make inferences about past and future sea-ice variability from only short observations or reconstructions.

AB  - Using Census of India data from 1901 to 2011 and national and international reports on women's condition in India, beginning with sex ratio trends according to regional distribution up to female infanticides and sex-selective abortions and dowry deaths, this study examines the sociological aspects of the gender imbalance in modern contemporary India. Gender inequality persistence in India proves that new values and structures do not necessarily lead to the disappearance of older forms, but they can co-exist with mutual adaptations and reinforcements. Data analysis suggests that these unexpected combinations are not comprehensible in light of a linear concept of social change which is founded, in turn, on a concept of social systems as linear interaction systems that relate to environmental perturbations according to proportional cause and effect relationships. From this perspective, in fact, behavioral attitudes and interaction relationships should be less and less proportionally regulated by traditional values and practices as exposure to modernizing influences increases. And progressive decreases should be found in rates of social indicators of gender inequality like dowry deaths (the inverse should be found in sex ratio trends). However, data does not confirm these trends. This finding leads to emphasize a new theoretical and methodological approach toward social systems study, namely the conception of social systems as complex adaptive systems and the consequential emergentist, nonlinear conception of social change processes. Within the framework of emergentist theory of social change is it possible to understand the lasting strength of the patriarchal tradition and its problematic consequences in the modern contemporary India.

AB  - In this work, extracts of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L) ligulate flowers obtained by Soxhlet, microwave-assisted, ultrasound-assisted and subcritical water extraction were compared in respect to their bioactivity, more specifically antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. In all obtained extracts, the content of total phenols and flavonoids was determined, indicating significant total extraction yields (49.70%) and total phenol content (151.45 mg ECA/ml) in water extracts obtained under moderate subcritical conditions. By applying DPPH and Reducing Power Test subcritical water extraction showed superior free-radical scavenging ability in comparison to other investigated extraction techniques. Microbial properties of extracts were examined using eight selected indicator strains and for all extracts minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range between 19.53 and 312.50 mu g/ml. Subcritical water extracts showed the highest activity against Escherichia coli (MIC= 39.10 mu g/ml) and Aspergillus niger (MIC= 39.10 mu g/ml). Cytotoxic effects of extracts were examined on human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD), cell line derived from human cervix carcinoma Hep2c (HeLa) and cell line derived from murine fibroblast (L20B). On all three tested cell lines, subcritical water extracts demonstrated much better antitumor properties in comparison to extracts obtained by other techniques, with IC50 values for Hep2c, RD and L2OB cells 30.54, 20.54 and 19.65 mu g/ml, respectively.

AB  - E-waste comprises discarded low quality protected electronic appliances that annually accumulate million tons of hazardous materials in the environment. Protection is provided to control unwanted voltages that usually generate in associated electrical circuits by a multi-junction ceramic in a voltage dependent varistor. The ceramic's microstructure consists of ZnO grains that are surrounded by the narrow boundaries of melted specific additives such as Bi2O3, TiO2 and Sb2O3. In fact, the boundaries manage the quality of protection through a certain volume of intrinsic oxygen vacancies transformation which depends on the amounts of the additives. Since these amounts are the ceramic fabrication's initial input variables, the optimization process is capable of improving the quality of the protection (non-linear coefficient) as an output of the varistor devices. In this work, the fabrication was designed and then experimentally performed to calculate the non-linear coefficients of the produced varistors as actual responses. The responses were used to obtain an appropriate model for the fabrication by different semi-empirical methods. Afterward, the models predicted the optimized amounts of the additives which maximized the quality of the varistors. The predicted condition was fabricated as final varistors that were electrically characterized to compare their nonlinear coefficients as the quality indicator. The comparison demonstrated that the optimized amounts of Bi2O3 (0.5), TiO2 (0.47) and Sb2O3 (0.21) in mol% provided the very high protective varistor with nonlinear coefficients of 28.1. In conclusion, the optimization, which has industrial scale-up potential, warranties the electronic protection that controls global e-waste.

AB  - Droughts often affect the soil ecosystem directly. To address this question, a series of prototype observation experiments were designed in this study. The objective of this study was to identify changing tendencies of microbial biomass carbon content and the proportion of microbial biomass carbon in soil organic carbon under different drought conditions. All the soil samples were collected from experiments fields about 10 cm far away from the rhizosphere of the maize, and the content of microbial biomass carbon was selected as indicator for identifying effects of extreme drought on agriculture soil ecosystem. The results showed that the optimum mass water content of soil for microbial biomass carbon was 19.5 % and the demarcation point of microbial biomass carbon to drought was 14.3 %, which could be used to demonstrate alters and degradation of soil ecosystem and the irrigation requirement of crops. Meanwhile, sustainability of different drought soil ecosystems was also evaluated after rainstorm with rehabilitation. The results suggested that soil ecosystem could recover after interfered by moderate drought, and its tolerance to drought, as well as its function and activity was improved. Soil system could not adapt to severe drought stress, could barely recover and restore from extreme drought within a few days, and its function and structure were also damaged. From this view, we could conclude that mass water content of soil should be kept above 10 % to avoid soil system function and structure being destroyed. Nevertheless, these findings suggested that soil ecosystem should be watered when mass water content was lower than 14.3 %, which provided reference for improving the soil to increase the grain output.

AB  - Assessing the effects of stressors, such as metals, on soils by microbial functional diversity (FD) indices based on soil enzymes is increasingly promoted. Various enzymatic FD indices were used in past studies but none generated toxicity thresholds such as EC50, the concentration of stressor affecting 50% of the maximum enzymatic activity. The aim of this study was to generate a realistic EC50 value from an enzyme-based FD index sensitive to Zn from long-term Zn-contaminated soils. Assays of 6 soil enzymes (arylsulfatase, phosphatase, protease, urease, beta-glucosidase and invertase) and metal characterization (total, soluble and labile Zn) were measured in 10 pairs of Zn-contaminated field-collected soils. Two approaches were studied in parallel: enzymatic activity (EA) and enzymatic stability (ES) assessed by the RSSIb, a score based on the modified Relative Soil Stability Index (RSSI) method. The enzymatic results (activity and stability) were then aggregated by various FD indices (weighted and geometric means, Shannon, Simpson and Gini indices) and correlated to Zn concentrations in soils to obtain the EC50 of these concentration response curves. The concentration response curves constructed from the EA weighted means were highly correlated to the labile and soluble Zn concentrations, and the EC50 generated from these curves were in a realistic bioavailable Zn range as compared to other studies. The aggregated ES showed Zn-sensitivity similar to the aggregated EA. Therefore, although the use of the ES approach was judicious for long-term Zn contamination, the greater resources required to assess the ES by RSSIb scores does not seem justified.

AB  - Exposure to ultrafine particles poses a potential health risk to school children. While many studies have focused on measuring ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations in environments where children are at risk of high exposure, few studies have examined the particle deposition in the respiratory tract of children. This study aims to examine the particle deposition in the respiratory tract of school children in different microenvironments. UFP size distribution data were collected in residential homes, school buses, school classrooms, and from school outdoor air in both rural and urban areas of South Texas. The size distribution data were input to the Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry model to calculate regional and total particle deposition fraction. A 24-hour-school-day exposure was simulated by adding the time children spend in each microenvironment. The maximum pulmonary deposition fraction occurs at a diameter ranging from 18 to 40 nm, depending on condition. Age mostly affected the pulmonary region and the total lung deposition with the highest deposition fraction observed for younger children. In addition, comparison of size-dependent regional deposition and particle concentration establishes an accurate depiction of children's exposure and dose profiles. While children only spend 4% of the day in the home source environment, that environment may account for up to 77% of total daily dose intake. Higher deposition fraction occurs at smaller particle size. Younger children show increased levels of particle deposition than older children. Exposure period does not correlate to daily percentage of dose intake. This research can be used to assess children's accumulative exposure to UFPs.

AB  - The role of solitary woody riparian plants with respect to local erosion and deposition of sediments is investigated. A focus is laid on the characteristics inclination' and permeability' of the plant's projected frontal area. Therefore, two experimental studies using cylindrical obstacles were carried out in a laboratory flume, one aiming at inclination, the other at permeability. The first series revealed that the total amount of mobilized sediment around the cylinder on average decreased by 8-10% per 5 degrees increasing inclination in streamwise direction. Locations of maximum scour depth simultaneously shifted downstream. A horseshoe vortex system, causing the frontal and lateral scouring, ceased to exist below inclinations of 25-30 degrees. The second series revealed that with increasing permeability, frontal scour incision is delayed, and the eroded sediment volume is significantly reduced. With permeable obstacles, two system states were observed: first, frontal scouring with leeside deposition at higher flow velocities and, second, moderate leeside scouring at lower flow velocities. For up-scaling and comparison, a field study focussing on fluvial obstacle marks at poplars and willows in secondary channels of the River Loire was additionally conducted. A modified analytical model enabled us to quantify the amount of deposited sediments leeside of the plants. Leeside sediment ridges are significantly stabilized and have a higher preservation potential when covered by pioneer vegetation. Under such conditions, they may indeed induce the development of stable islands. Eventually, sediment ridge width' turned out to be a suitable indicator for leeside deposited sediment volume, irrespective of spatial scale. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Using computer simulation model as a management tool requires model calibration and validation against field data. A three-year (2008-2009 to 2010-2011) field study was conducted at the Postgraduate Agricultural Research Station of the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, to simulate wheat grain yield production as a function of urea fertilizer applications using Crop Environment REsource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat model. The model was calibrated using yield data for treatment of urea fertilizer application at the rate of 247 kg-urea ha(-1) during growing season 2009-2010 and was validated against independent data sets of yield of two years (2008-2009 and 2010-2011) for a wide variety of treatments ranging from no urea application to 247 kg-urea ha(-1) application. The model simulations were found to be acceptable for calibration as well as validation period, as the model evaluation indicators showed a mean difference of 8.9%, ranging from 0.05 to 15.38%, root mean square error of 356 having its range from 242 to 471 kg ha(-1), against all observed grain yield data. The scenario simulations showed maximum grain yield of 4100 kg ha(-1) for 350 kg-urea ha(-1) in 2008-2009; 4600 kg ha(-1) for 300 kg-urea ha(-1) in 2009-2010 and 5200 kg ha(-1) for 340 kg-urea ha(-1) in 2010-2011. Any further increase in urea application resulted in decline of grain yield function. These results show that model has the ability to simulate effects of urea fertilizer applications on wheat yield; however, the simulated maximum grain yield data need field-based verification.

AB  - A soluble solids content (SSC) of 6.2% has been used as a minimum harvest index for 'Hayward' kiwifruit for about 30 years. This paper describes a study that examines the pattern of soluble solids accumulation in 'Hayward' kiwifruit beyond the simple timing at which fruit reach 6.2% and investigates the relationship between soluble solids accumulation and postharvest performance assessed as softening and expression of chilling injury. This has been done using fruit from 10 orchards harvested at a range of SSC from 5 to 10% during one season. Soluble solids accumulation showed a general trend for a change from slow to more rapid accumulation during the season that could be described by a single logistic curve. The point at which the rate of soluble solids accumulation increased was more or less distinct for fruit from different orchards and occurred when fruit were at SSC between 6.3 and 7.4%. It is also possible that there is not a consistent change in soluble solids accumulation rate, with the rate being dependent on the environmental conditions over several days before measurement. There was a major change in softening pattern and low temperature breakdown susceptibility between fruit harvested at 6.4 and at 8.0% SSC. This change coincided with a change to faster soluble solids accumulation at harvest. It is concluded that the pattern, or rate, of soluble solids accumulation is likely to be a more robust indicator of the physiological state of the fruit, and therefore postharvest performance, than a single SSC value.

AB  - Lithuania and Southern Sweden share similar natural conditions, but differ considerably in forest policies and management; thereby providing an opportune basis for comparative studies. Since the 1990s, Sweden has attempted to reduce the negative impact of its forest management on biodiversity, after decades of intensive production forestry. In contrast, Lithuania has been intensifying forestry practices associated with the post-soviet socio-economic transition. Here we assess the actual outcomes by comparing selected forest structure and composition variables known to be indicators for forest biodiversity; and estimate the prospective trends by scrutinising current forest policies and management.
   Our results indicate that Lithuanian forests consistently possessed higher rankings in six indices related to tree species composition, stand age, and deadwood quantities that are positively associated with forest biodiversity. The reverse is indicated by those data on stand age and tree diameter that are associated with centennial dynamics in forest utilisation intensity. With respect to policy instruments, Lithuania designates a substantially greater share of forest area to non-timber functions and legislates more severe management restrictions in forests targeting timber production. Concurrently, all estimates of forestry activities indicate more intensive forest management in Southern Sweden, including a higher share of artificial regeneration and shorter rotations. This allows concluding that, if current forest management practices persist, then an increased "biodiversity gap" may be expected between the two countries. The study concludes with discussing to what degree the identified trends are the direct product of targeted policies versus merely by-products of other factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The immission and deposition levels of selected pollutants occurring in the area of a typical Polish village have been presented. In the course of a year-long research project (2009-2010), concentration levels of gaseous compounds in the air were determined (SO2, NO2, C6H6), as well as the level of solid particles deposition with the consideration of their chemical composition (Mn, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu). Measurements were conducted in the area of rural settlements and at the site of plantation fields adjacent to the village. Classical analytical techniques (AAS, GC, IC) and biomonitoring with the use of mosses and lichens were used for the purposes of the study. Air quality in rural areas is determined mostly by the influence of the local sources (agricultural and uncontrolled emission) and that the quantity of toxicants enriching the environment depends on cyclical weather states periods characteristic for the temperate climate. The spatial location of the village and meteorological conditions conducive to the spread and dilution of pollutants. Average monthly and the average annual concentrations of the classic gaseous atmosphere quality indicators do not entail the atmosphere's serious degradation. The presence of heavy metals and size of their deposition in the dust have shown that air quality is not at a satisfactory level. The deposition of solid particles is determined by the partition in the formation of emissions between uncontrolled and agricultural sources. The major source of the gas pollutants is associated with uncontrolled emission from residential and farm buildings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative data about phytoavailability and transfer into consumed plant parts for heavy metals in intensively managed urban vegetable production areas of sub-Saharan Africa are scarce. We therefore studied the transfer of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) from soil to the root and subsequent translocation to edible portions of four vegetables in six urban gardens.
   RESULTS: While respective diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-available Zn and Cd concentrations ranged from 18 to 66 mg kg(-1) and from 0.19 to 0.35 mg kg(-1), respectively, in soils, total Zn and Cd were 8.4-256 mg kg(-1) and 0.04-1.7 mg kg(-1) in shoot parts. Metal transfer factor (MTF) ratios were higher in Zn (0.2-0.9) than in Cd (0.1-0.6). Our data suggest that total Zn concentration in soil is a reliable indicator to assess its transfer from soil to crop in lettuce, carrot and parsley, while for Cd DTPA-extractable concentration may be used to estimate soil-crop transfer of Cd in amaranthus and carrot. Overall, Cd was more easily translocated to the aerial plant parts than Zn.
   CONCLUSION: Zinc and Cd accumulation by vegetables in our soils is mainly a metabolically controlled process. Such accumulation can contaminate the ecosystem but under our conditions intake and ingestion of these metals will likely have to occur over a prolonged period to experience health hazard.

AB  - This paper provides recommendations on experimental design for early-tier laboratory studies used in risk assessments to evaluate potential adverse impacts of arthropod-resistant genetically engineered (GE) plants on non-target arthropods (NTAs). While we rely heavily on the currently used proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in this discussion, the concepts apply to other arthropod-active proteins. A risk may exist if the newly acquired trait of the GE plant has adverse effects on NTAs when they are exposed to the arthropod-active protein. Typically, the risk assessment follows a tiered approach that starts with laboratory studies under worst-case exposure conditions; such studies have a high ability to detect adverse effects on non-target species. Clear guidance on how such data are produced in laboratory studies assists the product developers and risk assessors. The studies should be reproducible and test clearly defined risk hypotheses. These properties contribute to the robustness of, and confidence in, environmental risk assessments for GE plants. Data from NTA studies, collected during the analysis phase of an environmental risk assessment, are critical to the outcome of the assessment and ultimately the decision taken by regulatory authorities on the release of a GE plant. Confidence in the results of early-tier laboratory studies is a precondition for the acceptance of data across regulatory jurisdictions and should encourage agencies to share useful information and thus avoid redundant testing.

AB  - Nutrients (N, P, Si) were studied in the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) of the Seine estuary at various moments of tidal cycles from April to October in 2001, 2002 and 2003, covering a salinity gradient from 0 to 27. Contrasted hydrological conditions were observed (extremely wet in 2001, unusually dry in 2003). Nutrient fluxes were analysed in terms of an indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (ICEP) using nutrient stoichiometry. Besides these three years, nutrient fluxes and corresponding ICEP values were analysed for a 17-year period, from 1990 to 2006.
   N, P and Si forms did not show ample transformations in the salinity gradient, revealing that, the estuary plays a limited buffer role at the interface between river and coastal zone, however not inconsiderable during dry hydrology when longer water and particle residence times are compatible with the biological growth rates. The simplified LIFT model of the TMZ, already used for analysing organic matter transformation, was implemented here to simulate the nutrients' behaviour in the salinity gradient and to quantify nutrient fluxes after their transit in the TMZ. Abatements ranging from 15% to 40% of incoming N and P were calculated, without significant changes for silica. Although P-ICEP values did not show a severe risk for coastal eutrophication for the past few years, contrary to the situation from 1970 to 2000, the high N-ICEP, due to a steady use of fertilisers in agriculture, is a real threat for eutrophication and harmful algal blooms.

AB  - Sexual dimorphisms in body size and head size are common among lizards and are often related to sexual selection on male fighting capacity (organismal performance) and territory defence. However, whether this is generally true or restricted to lizards remains untested. Here we provide data on body and head size, bite performance and indicators of mating success in the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), the closest living relative to squamates, to explore the generality of these patterns. First, we test whether male and female tuatara are dimorphic in head dimensions and bite force, independent of body size. Next, we explore which traits best predict bite force capacity in males and females. Finally, we test whether male bite force is correlated with male mating success in a free-ranging population of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). Our data confirm that tuatara are indeed dimorphic in head shape, with males having bigger heads and higher bite forces than females. Across all individuals, head length and the jaw closing in-lever are the best predictors of bite force. In addition, our data show that males that are mated have higher absolute but not relative bite forces. Bite force was also significantly correlated to condition in males but not females. Whereas these data suggest that bite force may be under sexual selection in tuatara, they also indicate that body size may be the key trait under selection in contrast to what is observed in squamates that defend territories or resources by biting.

AB  - This article describes the indigenous knowledge (IK) that agro-pastoralists in larger Makueni District, Kenya hold and how they use it to monitor, mitigate and adapt to drought. It examines ways of integrating IK into formal monitoring, how to enhance its value and acceptability. Data was collected through target interviews, group discussions and questionnaires covering 127 households in eight villages. Daily rainfall data from 1961-2003 were analysed. Results show that agro-pastoralists hold IK on indicators of rainfall variability; they believe in IK efficacy and they rely on them. Because agro-pastoralists consult additional sources, the authors interpret that IK forms a basic knowledge frame within which agro-pastoralists position and interpret meteorological forecasts. Only a few agro-pastoralists adapt their practices in anticipation of IK-based forecasts partly due to the conditioning of the actors to the high rainfall variability characteristic of the area and partly due to lack of resources. Non-drought factors such as poverty, inadequate resources and lack of preparedness expose agro-pastoralists to drought impacts and limit their adaptive capacity. These factors need to be understood and effectively addressed to increase agro-pastoralists' decision options and the influence of IK-based forecasts on their decision-making patterns. The limited intergenerational transfer of IK currently threatens its existence in the longer term. One way to ensure its continued existence and use is to integrate IK into the education curriculum and to link IK with formal climate change research through the participation of the local people. However, further studies are necessary to address the reliability and validity of the identified IK indicators of climate variability and change.

AB  - In the present study the impact of environmental metal contamination in gibel carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) was investigated coupling disturbances in subcellular metal distribution to effect biomarkers. Gibel carp were caught at six different sampling sites in Flanders (Belgium), characterized by different degrees in environmental metal contamination. Tissue Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations and total metallothioneon (MT) levels were determined in gills, liver and kidney. Cytosolic metal distribution was measured in the main accumulating organs, liver and kidney, revealing tissue- and metal-dependent profiles. The MT pool dominated the cytosolic distribution profile. Although the importance of the MT pool increased with increasing environmental and cytosolic metal concentrations, also an undefined fraction of Cu and Cd fractions (probably free metal ions or metals bound to small organic complexes) increased at the most contaminated sampling sites. Disturbances in serum ion concentrations, serum alanine aminotransferase activity (ALT), hematocrite and condition factor were measured, as indicators of toxic effects. At the sampling site with the highest environmental Cd pollution a significant decrease in serum Ca2+ concentrations and a significantly increased serum ALT activity were measured suggesting incomplete detoxification of Cd. Increased serum ALT concentrations suggested structural liver damage. The fact that the liver tissue, and probably also the kidney, could not cope with this high Cd burden in combination with the increased uptake of dissolved Cd through the gills most probably contributed to the perturbed serum Ca2+ homeostasis.

AB  - The study is devoted to sociological problems pertaining to the situation of women in the labour market. The problems were presented in the view of rural women themselves in relation to sociological literature and statistical data. The data which constitute the basis for the study are made up of 1600 questionnaires carried out on a nationwide sample of rural women as well as the reports from focus group interviews conducted with four groups of rural women.
   The study on 'Rural women in the labour market. The diagnosis, conditions and prospects' was carried out in 2007-2008 as a part of SOP HRD 1.6 (b) project 'The diagnosis of the social and professional situation of rural women in Poland" funded by ESF and implemented by the Polish Social Policy Association in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy.
   The objective of the research was to carry out a diagnosis and to indicate the reasons and the determinants of rural women's activity and inactivity in the labour market. Researchers outlined independent variables regarded as potential indicators of economic activity, the sense of job security, inactivity and the plans concerning future employment. The indicators were grouped into seven sets: 1. variables related to the social standing of an individual 2. family situation 3. socialization patterns 4. socio-political activity 5. environment-related factors 6. educational activity 7. a subjective assessment of the local labour market. The paper focuses on a number of socio-demographic correlates that affect rural women's labour market situation and merely outlines the presence of other variables that might be important from the point of view of professional activity of this group of women.

AB  - Attempts to improve animal welfare have commonly centered around three broad objectives: (1) to ensure good physical health and functioning of animals, (2) to minimize unpleasant "affective states" (pain, fear, etc.) and to allow animals normal pleasures, Mid (3) to allow animals to develop and live in ways that are natural for the species. Each of these objectives has given rise to scientific approaches for assessing animal welfare. An emphasis oil health and functioning has led to assessment methods based on rates of disease. injury, mortality, and reproductive success. An emphasis oil affective states has led to assessment methods based oil indicators of pain, fear, distress, frustration and similar experiences. An emphasis oil natural living has led to research oil the natural behavior of animals and oil the strength of animals' motivation to perform different elements of their behavior. All three approaches have yielded practical ways to improve animal welfare, and the three objectives are often correlated. However, under captive conditions, where the evolved adaptations of animals may not match the challenges of their current circumstances, the single-minded pursuit of any one criterion may lead to poor welfare its judged by the others. Furthermore, the three objectives arise front different philosophical views about what constitutes a good life-an area of disagreement that is deeply embedded in Western culture and that is not resolved by scientific research. If efforts to improve animal welfare are to achieve widespread acceptance, they need to strike a balance among the different animal welfare objectives. Zoo Biol 28:507-518, 2009.

AB  - Bioretention cells are a developing technology utilizing natural processes to facilitate treatment of surface water during runoff events. In bioretention cells, runoff collects in a shallow depression and percolates through the soil media, eliminating a variety of pollutants ranging from sediment to pathogenic bacteria. A series of column studies was used to evaluate the transport of bacteria through conventional and engineered cell media. The objective was to determine breakthrough concentration curves for the indicator organism Escherichia coli moving through simulated bioretention cell media (coarse sand, loamy sand, and loamy sand with coarse sand plugs), all tested under saturated conditions. Solutions with known concentrations of E. coli were introduced as a continuous source to the lower boundary of the column, and the effluent was analyzed for E. coli. The coarse sand was tested at 7.7 and 2.0 mL/min, where the final effluent concentrations in the higher and lower flow rate experiments were approximately 100% and 80% of the influent concentration, respectively. Final effluent concentrations in experiments with loamy sand at flow rates of 2.0 mL/min were approximately 12% of the influent concentration. However, when sand plugs were added to the loamy sand to improve infiltration capacity, filial effluent concentrations increased from 12% without plugs to approximately 65% of the influent concentration with plugs at the same flow rate. Mechanisms of removal were investigated by fitting concentration data to one-dimensional advection/dispersion equations with sorption and lumped physical straining and adhesion, and demonstrated the importance of both flow velocity and soil particle size distribution on E. coli transport. Design strategies to maximize infiltration in bioretention cells call be counterproductive to bacteria removal.

AB  - This paper describes work carried out within the EU-funded FOOTPRINT project to characterize the diversity of European agricultural and environmental conditions with respect to parameters which most influence the environmental fate of pesticides. Pan-European datasets for soils, climate, land cover and cropping were intersected, using GIS, to identify the full range of unique combinations of climate, soil and crop types which characterize European agriculture. The resulting FOOTPRINT European agro-environmental dataset constitutes a large number of polygons (approximately 1,700,000) with attribute data files for i) area fractions of annual crops related to each arable-type polygon (as an indicator of its probability of occurrence); and, ii) area fractions of each soil type in each polygon (as an indicator of its probability of occurrence). A total of 25,044 unique combinations of climate zones, agricultural land cover classes, administrative units and soil map units were identified. The same soil/crop combinations occur in many polygons which have the same climate while the fractions of the soils and arable crops are different. The number of unique combinations of climate, soil and agricultural land cover class is therefore only 7961. 26-year daily meteorological data, soil profile characteristics and crop management features were associated with each unique combination. The agro-environmental scenarios developed can be used to underpin the parameterization of environmental fate models for pesticides and should also have relevance for other agricultural pollutants. The implications for the improvement and further development of risk assessment procedures for pesticides are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Olorgesailie Formation is comprised of lacustrine, volcaniclastic and alluvial sediments that formed in the southern Kenya Rift between about 1.2 million and 490,000 years ago. Diatoms are common in much of the sequence and preserve a record of environmental change within the basin. A high-resolution diatom stratigraphy has been developed for these deposits. The data document the presence of freshwater and saline lakes as well as wetlands. Transfer functions indicate that these water bodies ranged in conductivity between about 200-20,000 mu S cm(-1), with pH varying between about 7.5 and 10.3. Pedogenesis affected multiple horizons within the succession, reflecting periods of emergence that encompass much of the time represented by the Olorgesailie Formation. A variety of other sedimentological indicators (carbonates, rhizoliths, mudcracks, erosional channels) also record periods when the sampled portions of the basin were dominated by terrestrial conditions. Stone tools are common at several levels, indicating the use of the area by hominins. Lakes and wetlands were potentially usable as sources of potable water by hominins for part of the basin history, but at other times were undrinkable. Other water sources (springs, rivers) would have been necessary during these periods. Paleoenvironments in the basin were complex and changed frequently with time. Such shifts in resources and habitat distribution during Olorgesailie Formation time seem likely to have influenced the behavior and evolution of local plant and animal populations, including Homo.

AB  - The epidermis of vertebrates is the body's principal barrier against environment and its possible contaminants. The presence of keratins, as well as specific detoxifying molecules or enzyme activities, in the various epidermis layers is believed to be involved in providing protection from harmful environmental influences. Anuran integument is poorly hornified and thus permeable to some endogenous and exogenous compounds and thus serves as a good bioindicator of overall environmental conditions. In the present investigation, we studied the epidermis of Rana kl. esculenta adult specimens collected at two different rice fields, relatively unpolluted and heavily polluted, respectively. Environmental pollution was assayed by chemical analysis performed on both sediments and animals. We evaluated the structural aspects of the epidermis at both light and electron microscopy levels and the pattern of keratinization by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we studied the activities of some enzymes (acid and alkaline phosphatase, nitric oxide synthase-related nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, catalase, nonspecific esterases, and succinic dehydrogenase) involved mainly in membrane transport, xenobiotics, and oxidative metabolism. Compared with controls, in polluted animals we found the following results: (1) an increase in pollutant levels (i.e., cadmium, mercury, and lead); (2) less keratinized superficial cells in the epidermis; and (3) changes in most enzyme activities in keratinocytes and mitochondria-rich cells (particularly glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and esterases, both important to counteract oxidative and toxic stress). Taken as a whole, the present data indicate the morphofunctional plasticity of the frog epidermis in response to environmental contamination.

AB  - Gorse (Ulex europaeus) infestation occupies over 4,000 ha of agriculture and conservation lands on the southeastern slope of Mauna Kea on the Island of Hawaii. The aim of this investigation is to identify ecological features associated with this weed invasion by comparing the gorse-infested areas to the surrounding uninfested areas of this landscape. The soils within the gorse infestation are more acidic, resulting in higher levels of KCl-extractable Al and lower levels of Mehlich III-extractable Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn. Yet, gorse accumulates higher concentrations of Ca, Zn and, Cu than the kikuyu grass (Pennesitum clandestinum), which is ubiquitous throughout the site. The Ca:Al and Mg:Al molar charge ratios of the soils are lowest within the epicenter of the gorse infestation, while the molar ratios are highest in the gorse apical stem tissues. All gorse plants are nodulated and have higher nitrogen contents than the surrounding kikuyu grass. Furthermore, the delta N-15 of the gorse stem tissues approaches 0 parts per thousand, suggesting that nitrogen is being symbiotically fixed from the atmosphere. Characterization of the Bradyrhizobium isolated from gorse nodules shows similarities and distinctions to Bradyrhizobium isolated from the endemic legume koa (Acacia koa) within the same location. Population densities of the indigenous Bradyrhizobium are higher within the gorse rhizosphere than the kikuyu grass. Soil acidification, nutrient depletion, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation distinguish gorse-infested areas from the surrounding uninfested areas. These observations suggest that gorse has a competitive advantage over kikuyu grass under conditions of soil nutrient deficiency.

AB  - Ultrafine particulate matter, from environmental or industrial exposure, can induce the expression of inflammatory mediators and promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage the alveolar epithelium of the lung. Previous studies have shown that various cellular stresses can activate signaling pathways that operate through the specific transcription factors (TF), AP-1, and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B that are known to regulate inflammatory gene expression. Persistent inflammation can induce a cascade of events that precedes the development of both acute and chronic fibrosis. From a murine Type II epithelial cell line, MLE15, a stable luciferase-transfected line, MLE15Luc2, was created. The luciferase reporter, operating under the guidance of a truncated human interleukin (IL)-8 promoter, contains NF-kappa B and AP-1 DNA binding sites. MLE15Luc2 cells were exposed to inflammatory or particulate stimuli, of varying size fractions and composition, under standard culture conditions, and inflammatory gene transcription, represented by luciferase enzyme activity, was determined. I kappa B alpha degradation appeared to be incongruent to changes in luciferase activity. The results were compared to those obtained using a stable luciferase-transfected human cell line, A549Luc1. Time-course data demonstrated increased luciferase enzyme activity, peaking by 6 h postexposure, and returning to baseline by 24 h, regardless of stimulus, in the absence of enhanced cytotoxicity. This suggests that key regulatory functions in these transfected cell lines are not clearly understood. These transfected cell lines may be useful for determining the inflammatory potential of various types of particulate and/or nonparticulate stimuli; however, conclusive signaling information cannot be gained from their use alone.

AB  - Ecological field studies in transgenic maize at Friemar (Thuringia)
   Long-time monitoring concepts for genetically modified crops demand the monitoring of side-effects on the ecology of field fauna and the microclimatic conditions of open habitats. In this context, epigeous arthropod coenoses are discussed as indicators of the ecological situation. This study focused on possible side-effects of the cultivation of transgenic maize in combination with applications of the herbicide Liberty (glufosinate ammonium) on arthropod coenoses. However, when putting this approach into practice, considerable problems arise from the fact that it takes very long to identify some taxa on species level. Therefore, the usefulness of grouping the Araneae into web-spinners and wandering spiders was tested.
   Using pitfall traps, 4881 individuals belonging to 69 species were caught and identified. Carabidae dominated with a share of 69% (3376 individuals), while Araneae (25%, 1206 individuals) and Staphylinidae (6.1%, 299 individuals) showed lower activity.
   Regarding individual numbers and species diversity, the dominant carabids did not show any significant differences between the transgenic and the conventional variants. In both variants, the coenosis was composed of species typical for open-land habitats (P. melanarius, C. fuscipes, T. quadristriatus). The staphylinid beetles however, did show a higher activity in the transgenic variant. The spider coenosis was dominated by web-spinner species (Linyphiidae, Theridiidae, Tetragnathidae). For the spiders as well differences between the variants did not reach statistical significance. On the whole, the activity density and the species diversity tended to be slightly higher in the conventional variant.
   In conclusion, the cultivation of transgenic maize together with the application of the herbicide Liberty did not show any statistically significant effects on the ecology of epigeous arthropod coenoses.

AB  - Naturally occurring isotopes of radium were measured in the Gulf of Mexico in the discharge zones of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers during 1993 and 1994, and a model was developed to help interpret the relative contributions of different end-members to the mixing zones. Samples collected from below the pycnocline were enriched in Ra-226 and Ra-228, much beyond activities expected for surface samples of similar salinities. The elevated bottom water radium activities could not be supported by diffusion from bottom sediments, nor from resuspension and desorption of regenerated radium, They appear to originate from subterranean seepage of radium-rich groundwater which, while seeping through the sediments, also enriches these sediments in radium (by adsorption). From the measured riverine dissolved and particulate loads, the total Ra-226 flux was estimated to be 1.1 X 10(14) dpm year(-1) (disintegrations per minute per year) from the Mississippi River and 0.5 x 10(14) dpm year(-1) from the Atchafalaya River. The Ra-228 flux was estimated to be 1.3 X 10(14) dpm year(-1) from the Mississippi River and 0.6 X 10(14) dpm year(-1) from the Atchafalaya River. However, surface waters in both river plumes contained radium activities exceeding the maximum activities expected from river and ocean inputs. There is evidence that the frequency with which radium-rich water from below the thermocline gets mixed with the surface water in the plume depends to a large extent on local weather conditions and the depth of the water column.

AB  - Sour starch or "polvilho azedo", a sun-dried fermented cassava starch is widely known in Brazil as an important cooking ingredient, mainly for biscuit making. As the process arose from popular knowledge all over the country, it is possible to found different ways of production, nowadays focused in the Southeast and Southern States. The standard of quality of sour starch is not yet clearly defined and empirical quality tools are used in order to manage the production process and to commercialize the product. The economical possibilities which arise with the opening of the frontiers for exportation process in South America MERCOSUL strongly recommend further studies in this area. In the present study 31 samples of sour starch were collected in Parana for investigations concerning sanitary conditions and physical, chemical and functional properties. In almost all samples it was detected foreign bodies including insects, acarides, rodent's hair and sandy material. The results concerning physical, chemical and functional properties stated medium, minimum and maximum values as well as the range of values at 95% confidence. Compared to the properties of natural cassava starch, overlapping was observed in water content and in water binding capacity. The properties that could be used to discriminate the natural and fermented starch are pH, acidity, solubility of the granules, and specific volume and degree of expansion of the biscuit Further statistical analysis showed no correlation among the properties, and the results were not useful to discriminate clusters of similarity. As the degree of expansion and specific volume of the biscuit are suitable indicator of quality, both properties can be used to manage the quality of the product and of the process.

AB  - In immature and adult females of protogynous gobies, small distinctive masses of cells associated with the ovarian wall develop into testis-associated glandular structures during sex change. These precursive accessory gonadal structures, or pAGS, have been found in females of known protogynous goby species, but not among gonochoric goby species, suggesting that their presence can be used as a species-specific indicator of protogyny within the family. However, a detailed examination of a developmental series of ovaries in two gonochoric species, Gobiosoma illecebrosum and G. saucrum, revealed the presence of a gonodal feature previously thought to be restricted to protogynous gobies. Among immature females of both species, pAGS-like structures having a similar appearance and placement as functional pAGS of protogynous gobies were found. In female G. illecebrosum, the size of these structures among immatures progressively decreased with maturation and were absent in all but the smallest adult females. A similar pattern was evident in a small sample of G. saucrum. Population demography based on field collections showed that G. illecebrosum exhibits sex ratios and male and female size-frequency distributions typical of gonochores and laboratory experiments indicated that final sexual identity was unaffected by social environment during the juvenile period. Thus, the presence of pAGS in juvenile female G. illecebrosum is not related to an ability to change sex at that ontogenic interval. Whether the transient pAGS observed here are vestiges of an ancestral protogynous condition is unknown. Based on their presence among immatures in two gonochore gobies, however, only the presence of pAGS in adult females should be used to predict protogyny among gobies.

AB  - The TRH-related peptide, pGlu-Glu-ProNH(2), which was first identified in rabbit prostate has recently been named fertilization-promoting peptide (FPP) because of its ability to enhance the in vitro fertilizing potential of mouse epididymal spermatozoa. This study set out to examine the nature of the TRH-related peptides in human prostate and semen but, first, the optimal conditions for collection of semen samples were investigated. FPP was degraded slowly (t(1/2) = 163 min, S.E. +/- 51.3, n = 6) in seminal plasma which has allowed us to measure accurately the concentrations of FPP, after extraction of the peptide in acidified acetone precisely 5 min after ejaculation. In this way, high levels of FPP (mean: 49.5 nmol/l) were detected in normal human semen, from young men, although other TRH-related peptides did not appear to be present. We have also examined the TRH-related peptides present in prostate samples from clinical patients both with and without evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), by ion-exchange chromatography followed by radioimmunoassay. Substantial concentrations of FPP were observed in normal (4.10 pmol/g tissue, S.E. +/- 1.46) and BPH prostate (6.27 pmol/g tissue, S.E. +/- 1.65). In addition, a second, neutral TRH-immunoreactive peptide was always detected in BPH tissue (7.40 pmol/g tissue, S.E. +/- 1.98) with only low levels generally present in normal prostate. The possibility that the presence of high levels of the neutral peptide in prostate may be used as an indicator of the onset of BPH deserves further scrutiny.

AB  - Immunotoxicology studies the undesired effects of interactions between xenobiotics and the immune system, mainly in toxicity experiments in rodents. The histopathology of the lymphoid organs is a cornerstone in such studies. In this review we describe practical aspects of sampling lymphoid organs and subsequent tissue processing and application of conventional and advanced histologic techniques. Thereafter, some aspects of proper reading and interpretation of histopathology is discussed, in relation to modifying factors such as age, sex, strain of animals, housing conditions, and nutritional status. These factors can substantially confound the outcome and interpretation of experiments, due to the highly dynamic characteristics of the immune system. Immunotoxicity tests are normally performed in a tiered approach. We describe the screening tier in the rat species that has been developed in the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands, and illustrate the value of histopathology by an example of immunotoxicity testing of pesticides. Subsequently, the tiered approach in the mouse species followed by the National Toxicology Program in the USA, is described. In the evaluation of chemicals with suspected immunotoxic potential using this approach, histopathology proved to be less sensitive in 'flagging' immunotoxicity. This may be related to the lower doses that are applied in this toxicity design, because at higher doses histopathology is a sensitive indicator of toxicity. A global description of pathologic alterations after toxic insult is given, followed by representative examples taken from immunosuppressive drugs - the cytostatic agent 5-fluorouracil, and drugs interfering with cytokine expression, namely, Cyclosporin A, FK-506, and Rapamycin.

AB  - Relative role of intrinsic density-dependent factors (such as inter- and intraspecific competition, predation) and extrinsic density-independent factors (environmental changes) in population dynamics is a key issue in ecology. Density-dependent mechanisms are considered as important drivers of population dynamics in many vertebrate and insect species; however, their influence on the population dynamics of freshwater invertebrates is not clearly understood. In this study, I examined interannual variations in the abundance of the glacial relict amphipod Monoporeia affinis in a small subarctic lake based on long-term (2002-2019) monitoring data. The results suggest that the population dynamics of amphipods in the lake is influenced by the combined effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The reproductive success of amphipod cohorts was inversely related to its initial abundance, indicating it is influenced by density-dependent factors. M. affinis recruitment was negatively correlated with population density and near-bottom temperature but positively correlated with food availability, which is defined as the concentration of chlorophyll a. Multiple regression with chlorophyll, temperature, and abundance of parent cohort as independent factors explained about 80% of the variation in the reproductive success of amphipods. The negative correlation between amphipod recruitment and water temperature indicates that the current climate conditions adversely affect the populations of glacial relict amphipods even in cold-water lakes of the subarctic zone. Results of this study can be useful in environmental assessments to separate population oscillations connected with density-dependent mechanisms from human-mediated changes.

AB  - An experiment was executed at field condition to evaluate ecological impact of Bt cotton (Mech 162 + Bt) on soil microbes and Bt protein behavior in soil. Root exudates of Bt cotton plant containing Bt protein enter into soil which persisted in soil for atleast 235 days after sowing (DAS). During vegetative and flowering stage, Bt protein was not detectable in both qualitative and quantitative assay but, during onset of boll formation at 150 DAS, a level of 0.0013 mu g/g of Cry 1Ac protein was quantified in rhizospheric soil which further increased exponentially up to 0.0033 mu g/g at 195 DAS and then maintained at the same level till 235 DAS with Cry1Ac expression level of 0.0029 mu g/g soil. Rhizospheric soil of Bt cotton had significantly higher (p < 0.05) abundance of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) of gram positive bacteria. Abundance of polyunsaturated FAMEs that are indicators of fungi, were slightly higher in Bt as compared to non-Bt cotton soils. The metabolic profiling, also called community level physiological profiling (CLPP) showed more microbial functional diversity (Shannon-Wiener Diversity) in soil samples of different growth stages of Bt cotton than its corresponding non-Bt variety. Our results showed that Cry 1AC Bt protein persists in clay loamy soil even after harvesting and significantly altered microbial community composition and functional diversity in rhizospheric soil of Bt cotton than non-Bt. Any possible and unintentional changes in composition of root exudes of Bt cotton could regulate the selection of different microbial communities and thus can alter functional responses.

AB  - The effect of environmental pollution on epigenetic changes and their heredity in affected organisms is of major concern as such changes can play a significant role in adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Changes of epigenetic marks including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA's can induce changes in gene transcription leading to physiological long-term changes or even transgenerational inheritance. Such mechanisms have until recently been scarcely studied in invertebrate organisms, mainly focusing on model species including Caenorhabditis elegans and Daphnia magna. However, more data are becoming available, particularly focused on DNA methylation changes caused by anthropogenic pollutants in a wide range of invertebrates. This review examines the literature from field and laboratory studies utilising invertebrate species exposed to environmental pollutants and their effect on DNA methylation. Possible mechanisms of epigenetic modifications and their role on physiology and adaptation as well as the incidence of intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance are discussed. Furthermore, critical research challenges are defined and the way forward is proposed. Future studies should focus on the use of next generation sequencing tools to define invertebrate methylomes under environmental stress in higher resolution, those data should further be linked to gene expression patterns and phenotypes and detailed studies focusing on transgenerational effects are encouraged. Moreover, studies of other epigenetic mechanisms in various invertebrate species, apart from DNA methylation would provide better understanding of interconnected cross-talk between epigenetic marks. Taken together incorporating epigenetic studies in ecotoxicology context presents a promising tool for development of sensitive biomarkers for environmental stress assessment.

AB  - Land and space are major driving factors in doing business in urban areas. Cities around the world are performing land management techniques to achieve sustainable urban development. The World Bank acknowledges the importance of land management practices and promotes it as the Ease Of Doing Business (EODB) indicators for a supportive environment for economic activities. In improving a city?s competitiveness, local governments need to establish a reliable Land Administration System to organize unrenewable urban land and spaces and simultaneously reduce information asymmetry between actors. A modernized LAS is needed to accommodate the four functions of land management: land tenure, land value, land-use planning, and land development. The ISO 19152:2012 on Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) standard offers a foundation to establish information interoperability in land management that is crucial in modeling the relationship between people and land (and space), the geometrical components, as well as documented Rights, Responsibilities, and Restrictions (RRRs) in land. To promote the exchange of information between the domains of land administration domain and spatial planning, an extension of LADM, the Spatial Plan Information Package (SP Package), was proposed to support cities organizing information in land management. This article presents the proposed spatial plan information extension to the LADM country profile for Indonesia. This work also develops a proof-of-concept of the package in the two biggest Indonesian cities (Jakarta and Bandung) with adaptation to the current national data management policies. Our research shows positive results on making the LADM country profile reflect on the real condition and improving LAS?s adaptability to be integrated with the Spatial Information Infrastructure.

AB  - The full climate impacts of forest production and biomass use, and economic profitability of forest biomass production were studied under four alternative initial age structures of a forested landscape (young, even-aged, middle-aged and mature) in boreal conditions over 80 years. The forested landscapes occupied either by Scots pine or Norway spruce were managed by using seven management scenarios. The current thinning recommendations were considered as a baseline and alternative scenarios included maintaining 20% higher or lower stocking than in the baseline. The previous ones were also managed by using N fertilization, and an unthinned scenario (with final felling) was used as a comparison. A life cycle assessment tool with inputs from a forest ecosystem model was used to calculate full climate impacts of forest production and biomass use in substituting fossil-fuel-intensive materials and fossil fuels. The results showed that increased stocking and N fertilization were generally the most optimal forest management scenarios for full climate impacts and economic profitability in both species. Increased carbon sequestration through forest management surpassed the decreased economic profitability, and no single management scenario maximized both climate impact and economic profitability. The lowest climate impact, but the highest economic profitability, was found for the initially mature age structure. The calculated average displacement factors for the harvested wood products served as valid indicators for climate impacts but could not thoroughly depict the absolute climate impacts. More research is needed to improve the dynamic connection between forest ecosystem carbon balances and the substitution effects of harvested wood products.

AB  - The findings of experimental research into the environmental and energy performance indicators characterizing the combustion of promising coal-water slurries based on the coal processing waste (filter cake), rapeseed oil, and water are presented. The relative environmental, economic, and energy characteristics of their combustion are compared with those of coal. The most promising composition in terms of environmental characteristics and relative indicators is based on 90% of filter cake N (wet) and 10% of rapeseed oil. A composition is also identified that sustainably undergoes the intense micro-explosive fragmentation: it is based on 9% of filter cake N (dry), 10% of water, and 81% of rapeseed oil. The micro-explosive fragmentation of the parent drop provides a significant increase in the slurry surface area. This increases the heat release per unit time due to fuel burnout. We establish the regimes, threshold conditions, and outcomes of droplet micro-dispersion with varying temperature in a wide range (200-1100 degrees C) typical of the so-called low-temperature fuel combustion. This regime is generally considered the most environmentally friendly, i.e., producing the least anthropogenic emissions. Using the research findings, we calculate the size distributions of child droplets, the ratios of their average size to the original size of the parent droplet, the evaporation surface areas, and the external surface area of the resulting aerosol cloud. The combustion of coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals can produce less anthropogenic emissions due to the presence of water in the component composition and through the micro-explosive fragmentation of droplets.

AB  - Today, the search for the most optimal modes of storage and processing of fresh plant products, which reduce the content of nitrates in food, remains relevant. In this work, the possibility of using natural sorbents of different nature to reduce the content of nitrates in fresh vegetable juices was studie. The juice was separated from the sorbent by filtration and the filtrate was analyzed for nitrate content by the ionometric method on a pH meterionometer "Expert-001". The sorption activity of sorbents was calculated according to the indicators of the total binding index (R, %) and distribution coefficient (D), sorption isotherms were constructed and their thermodynamic parameters were determined. The objects of the study were fresh vegetable juices; dispersed mineral bentonite, gelatin and synthetic flocculant polyoxyethylene were used as sorbents. Determination of the total binding index (R, %) and the sorbents' distribution coefficient (D) of nitrates from juices showed that the use of sorbents reduces the nitrate content by an average of 1.2-1.9 times. The maximum sorption activity at 3 hours of contact with the juice occurred with bentonite (total nitrate binding 16.1%; distribution coefficient 19.0), the minimum - with the synthetic sorbent polyoxyethylene (total binding 5.5%; distribution coefficient 5.8). It is established that the experimental production of Langmuir adsorption isotherms and the calculation of thermodynamic properties of sorption allow tp optimize the choice of sorbents to reduce nitrate contamination of fresh vegetable juices. The most effective sorbents for reducing the content of nitrates in natural juices are bentonite and gelatin. The given conditions of processing natural juices by sorbents can be recommended for prevention of nitrate pollution of natural juices at their production.

AB  - Trends of globalization very often cause the emergence of phenomena that asymmetrically affect the overall sustainability of the transport system. In order to predict certain situations and potentially be able to manage the transport system, it is necessary to manage risk situations and traffic safety in a timely manner. This study has conducted an investigation which implies defining the level of safety of a total of nine sections of two-lane roads. The main aim of the paper is to create a new multiphase model consisting of CRITIC (The CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation), Fuzzy FUCOM (Full Consistency Method), DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), and Fuzzy MARCOS (Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution) methods for determining the level of traffic safety on road sections under the conditions of uncertainty. In order for the created model to be adequately applied, eight parameters were created, and they were classified through four inputs and four outputs. To calculate the significance of the inputs, the CRITIC method based on the symmetric correlation matrix was used, and taking into account the nature of the outputs, the Fuzzy FUCOM method based on averaged values using the fuzzy Bonferroni Mean (BM) operator was applied to determine their weights. To determine the degree of safety, the DEA model was created. After that, the Fuzzy MARCOS method was used in order to determine the final ranking of the remaining five sections of the road network. Finally, the verification of results was performed through three phases of Sensitivity Analysis (SA).

AB  - We aimed to investigate insulin amyloid fibril polymorphism caused by salt effects and heating temperature and to visualize the structural differences of the polymorphisms in situ using Raman imaging without labeling. The time course monitoring for amyloid formation was carried out in an acidic condition without any salts and with two species of salts (NaCl and Na2SO4) by heating at 60, 70, 80, and 90 degrees C. The intensity ratio of two Raman bands at 1672 and 1657 cm(-1) due to antiparallel beta-sheet and alpha-helix structures, respectively, was revealed to be an indicator of amyloid fibril formation, and the relative proportion of the beta-sheet structure was higher in the case with salts, especially at a higher temperature with Na2SO4. In conjunction with the secondary structural changes of proteins, the S-S stretching vibrational mode of a disulfide bond (similar to 514 cm(-1)) and the ratio of the tyrosine doublet I-850/I-826 were also found to be markers distinguishing polymorphisms of insulin amyloid fibrils by principal component analysis. Especially, amyloid fibrils with Na2SO4 media formed the gauche-gauche-gauche conformation of disulfide bond at a higher rate, but without any salts, the gauche-gauche-gauche conformation was partially transformed into the gauche-gauche-trans conformation at higher temperatures. The different environments of the hydroxyl groups of the tyrosine residue were assumed to be caused by fibril polymorphism. Raman imaging using these marker bands also successfully visualized the two- and three- dimensional structural differences of amyloid polymorphisms. These results demonstrate the potential of Raman imaging as a diagnostic tool for polymorphisms in tissues of amyloid-related diseases.

AB  - The construction of paleo-climatic calendar based on various evidences as well as instrumental records of climatic elements tell that climate has changed to a great extent over time. Scientific evidences establish the fact that the impacts of climate change are having wide immediate as well as long-term indirect effects on public health. Especially the focus is on climate change impacts in terms of increased severity, frequency and spread of vector-borne diseases. Climate changes in terms of increased average temperatures, more intense rainfall, extended summer season and less intense winters can impact the range and incidence of infectious and vector-borne diseases. Odisha, an eastern coastal state of India, is not an exception in experiencing the effects of climate change in spreading of vector-borne diseases. Malaria is one of the most important and widely distributed vector-borne disease observed in Odisha. Transmission of malaria is a dynamic process influenced by the changes in ecological and meteorological conditions. The other vector-borne diseases observed in Odisha since last decade include dengue, Japanese encephalitis and chikungunya. The mid-June period is usually characterized by onset of South West monsoon in Odisha in past. However, the analysis indicates an increase in number of heat wave days in the month of June in recent years, which may be an indicator of gradual shift of monsoon season in Odisha. The results also indicate that vector-borne disease conducive season extends from July till November, nearly half of the year. Further, the dengue and chikungunya are more prevalent in coastal districts, whereas malaria and JE have been experienced in interior districts.

AB  - Sweet oranges in Puerto Rico and other citrus-producing areas in the world have been greatly affected by the Huanglongbing disease (HLB). Historically, most of Puerto Rico's citrus production has been located from 0-600 m above sea level, where fruit acquire a desirable color and flavor due to climatic conditions. However, higher populations of the disease vector Diaphorina citri Kuwayama have been reported at these elevations in Puerto Rico. Although only 6.4% of the land area is located above 600 m, it is composed mainly of environmentally sensitive or non-arable land where Inceptisols are the dominant soil order. For that reason, 'Marr's Early' and 'Pera' sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) scions grafted on 'Carrizo', 'HRS 802', and 'HRS 812' rootstocks were planted in Alonso clay series Inceptisol (Oxic Humudepts) at 649 m in 2010. Tree growth parameters (height, diameter, canopy volume) and yield efficiency were measured. Fruit quality was determined from juice content (%), total soluble solids [degrees Brix], and pH. Leaf tissue analyses showed an optimum range for Ca, Mg, Na, P, B, Cu, and Zn, an indicator of tree health. A few were high (i.e., N and P) or in excess (i.e., Fe), but no clear connection to specific scions or rootstocks could be established. Tree height, tree diameter, fruit production, and juice content were higher in both sweet oranges grafted on 'HRS 802' compared with those on 'HRS 812' and 'Carrizo'. Therefore, 'HRS 802' rootstock can be recommended to local farmers growing sweet oranges in Alonso series soil.

AB  - On-farm adoption of agricultural conservation practices or management alternatives depends on conservation ethic, social pressure, regulatory attention, and perceived impact on yield and economic return. Although agro-economic and environmental impacts are assumed to conflict, little research has been conducted to address potential tradeoffs and provide a scientific basis for decision-making.Thus, this 16-year evaluation of adaptive nutrient management was conducted in the Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion on six fields with structural conservation practices already in place. Each field was randomly selected to receive either commercial fertilizer or poultry litter at rates of 4.5 to 13.4 Mg ha(-1). Two major nutrient management adaptations were made (i.e., soil test nitrogen [N] rate recommendations in 2009, and reduction of fallow period length and cover cropping during prolonged fallow periods in 2013). Important results included (1) soil test recommendations that consider historical crop yields reduced N application 25% to 38% for low rates of poultry litter, but did not reduce profits; (2) interannual variability of economic and weather conditions contributed to the lack of statistically significant differences in profit, although profit reduction for high nutrient rate treatments was clear; and (3) litter application, especially at rates in excess of crop phosphorus (P) needs, also increased runoff P losses by 1 to 1.4 kg ha(-1) indicating the need for careful management of organic nutrient sources. Results of this long-term study showed that maintaining or increasing economic return does not have to be sacrificed to improve environmental impacts, which is an important consideration as producers make on-farm management decisions.

AB  - Quarry exploitation and restoration practices are expected to have overarching and contrasting impacts on animal communities. Although many studies describe these impacts, they generally overlook the effects on population dynamics and individual movements. We assessed the impacts of quarry exploitation and restoration activity on population dynamics, individual movement, and habitat use of a sand-dwelling specialist beetle (Scarites cyclops). The study was performed on three plots: one adjacent to the margin of quarry exploitation, another subjected to restoration practices, and a control plot with no disturbance. A capture-mark-recapture approach was undertaken to estimate population parameters, movement, and habitat use. In the exploitation plot S. cyclops exhibited lower probability of recapture and lower apparent survival, as well as many movements fleeing away from quarry limits. Habitat suitability modeling showed that the exploitation plot provided better habitat conditions for the species than the restoration plot. It exhibited higher bare ground cover with scattered clumps of vegetation and higher proportions of fine sand (<0.4 mm). In the restoration plot, S. cyclops population showed a lower abundance, with a higher rate of recaptures, and a more limited dispersal ability of the individuals. There is an apparent early stage of colonization by S. cyclops in the restoration plot, but movements may already be hampered by unsuitable habitat restoration (higher herbaceous cover and different soil texture). We suggest preserving suitable habitat patches in the vicinity of the impacted areas and providing dispersal routes. Beyond vegetation, soil texture must be considered to allow local animal communities to establish in restored areas.

AB  - Freshwater crayfish are bioindicators of environmental pollution, often used for the assessment of heavy metal (HM) presence in the tissues, a time-consuming and expensive task. In this study, we propose the use of the vibrational spectroscopy to detect in a fast, non-destructive and sensitive way the presence of HM in the cephalothorax exoskeleton of the freshwater crayfish. Incorporation of HM into the cephalothorax exoskeleton was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. In particular, the cephalothorax exoskeleton of five crayfish species (Astacus leptodactylus, Procambarus clarkii, Austropotamobius pallipes, Faxonius limosus, and Pacifastacus leniusculus) was analyzed by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy in the presence or absence of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) up to 4 weeks at various concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, ppm). The ATR-FTIR profile of the crayfish cephalothorax exoskeleton was compatible with the presence of amorphous calcium carbonate, chitin, and proteins. The incubation with the HM revealed two main modifications: the shift of the peak from 859 to 872 cm(-1) and the appearance of a peak at 712 cm(-1). Both are ascribable to the HM interaction with calcium carbonate. The absorbance of both peaks increased along with the time of incubation, and the HM concentration. We conclude that ATR-FTIR analysis can be a useful, quick, and cost-sensitive tool to detect HM presence in the crayfish cephalothorax exoskeleton. However, it has to be regarded as a non-specific analytical technique for assessing HM contamination, since it is unable to discriminate between different HM.

AB  - For more than a century, the study of streamflow recession has been dominated by seemingly physically based parametric methods that make assumptions on the nonlinear nature of the hydrograph recession. In practice, several studies have shown that various degrees of nonlinearity occur in the same time series and that parametric methods can underfit nonlinear recession patterns. As a result, these methods are often applied empirically to each recession segment. We propose a parsimonious data-driven model, EDM-Simplex, with two objectives: forecasting recession and characterizing its nonlinear behavior. We evaluate the new model through a global sensitivity analysis applied to three distinctive hydrograph series from a heterogeneous karstic catchment. The results show excellent 1-day-ahead forecasting performance (median Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.99) for all time series with four recession extraction methods. The sensitivity analysis also showed that empirical nonlinearity, that is, sensitivity to initial conditions, is best estimated through the absolute forecast performance and its decline over time. This indicator leads to different interpretations of nonlinearity compared to previous methods but is just as sensitive to the choice of recession extraction method. In particular, when forecasts were made for recession segments containing early stages of recession or flow anomalies, the upstream recession was significantly more linear than the downstream recession hydrographs affected by the karst. Consequently, our results support future research to interpret observed nonlinearities as a function of the catchment hydrological states for better integration of empirical, physical-based, and operational approaches to recession analysis.

AB  - The aim of this study is the modelling and the optimization of energy consumption during essential oils extraction by conventional and microwave assisted processes. As regards energy efficiency assessment, an indicator has been developed and used that reflects the evolution of energy consumed per mass unit of essential oil extracted. The adopted modelling approach allows, in addition of energy consumption estimation, to follow its evolution throughout the extraction process. For models validation purposes, a set of 170 extraction kinetics data reported in the literature was used. The results showed that the simulated energy consumption during the extraction process is in good agreement with the measured values in all studied cases. Also these results show that an increase of essential oil recovery rate from 90% to 99% induced an energy consumption multiplied by a factor between 1.8 and 11 whether in conventional processes or those assisted by microwaves. This increase of energy consumption per mass of extracted essential oil highlights the fact that targetting a maximal oil recovery through plant depletion, is neither an economical nor an ecological optimum. The comparison between classical and microwaves assisted processes showed that generally the use of microwave heating reduce energy consumption with a reduction factor varying between 2 and 10 regardless of the extraction yield. This modeling approach provides a valuable insight on the optimal work conditions in favor of a cleaner production of essential oils and can be considered as a precious tool for increasing efficiency in the use of energy and cost reduction.

AB  - Phoenix, Arizona, observes a high summertime frequency for daily maximum 8-h ozone averages (DMO8) exceeding 70 parts per billion, resulting in nonattainment status by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This study discusses the use of composite atmospheric sounding analysis (constructing average sounding conditions for specific recurring events) to forecast different air quality index daily ozone classifications, including "good," "moderate," and collectively categories exceeding the 2015 ozone standard. Composite sounding analysis, using the Phoenix 1200 UTC (0500 LST) rawinsonde data (2006-17), identifies "pollutant dispersion windows" for ozone accumulation or dispersal for Phoenix during the North American monsoon (July and August period). A favorable ozone exceedance atmosphere is associated with a "Four Corners high" synoptic pattern bringing relatively light winds at and below 700 hPa (<= 4.5 ms(-1)) and higher easterly winds above (<= 12.3 ms(-1)). Healthy ozone days (good category) are common when Pacific low pressure troughing over the western United States creates deep and faster westerly flow above the surface reaching speeds of 6.7 (19.5) m s(-1) by 700 (200) hPa. Surprisingly, large standard deviations over 10 degrees C for dewpoint temperature at midlevels (500-400 hPa) were determined for all three daily ozone classification ranges used in this study. Additionally, modest temperature deviations and mean differences are noted at significant pressure levels. Consequently, wind speed and direction are better indicators when forecasting ozone accumulation potential. These results are pertinent to air quality meteorologists responsible for disseminating ozone forecasts for heavily urbanized areas of the U.S. Southwest.

AB  - The microbial quality of irrigation water is typically assessed by measuring the concentrations of E. coli in irrigation water reservoirs that are variable in space and time. E. coli concentrations are affected by water quality parameters that co-vary with E. coli concentrations and may be easily measured with currently available sensors. The objective of this work was to identify the most influential environmental covariates affecting E. coli concentrations during a three-month biweekly monitoring period within two irrigation ponds in Maryland during the summer of 2017. E. coli levels as well as sensor-based water quality parameters including turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved fluorescent organic matter, conductivity, and chlorophyll were measured at 23 and 34 locations in ponds 1 and 2, respectively. Regression tree analyses were used to determine the most influential water quality parameters for the prediction of E. coli levels. Correlations between E. coli and water quality covariates were not strong and were inconsistently significant. Shoreline sample locations had higher E. con concentrations than interior pond samples and significant differences were observed when comparing these two groups. Regression trees provided fairly accurate predictions of E. coli levels based on water quality parameters with R-2 values ranging from 0.70 to 0.93. Factors identified via the regression trees varied by sampling date but common leading covariates included cyanobacteria, organic matter, and turbidity. Results indicated environmental covariates, sensed either remotely or in situ, could be useful to delineate areas with different E. coli survival conditions across irrigation ponds and potentially other water bodies such as lakes, rivers, or bays.

AB  - Environmental conditions and human-landscape interaction during the onset of the irrigated agriculture in Oasisamerica are not clear yet. In la Playa site (Sonora, NW Mexico), the evidences of sedentary population, land cultivation, and water management developed after the end of Altithermal period (around 4500 yr BP) include more than 550 archaeological features including hundreds of human cremations and a net of buried artificial channels. These findings were closely associated with several palaeosol levels alternating with sediments within a large alluvial fan. We studied micromorphological features, physical characteristics (color, texture, rock magnetic properties), and composition of organic matter, from three profiles (Maravillas, Zanja, and Cuatro Suelos), to reconstruct pedogenesis and sedimentary environment of the palaeosol sequences. Additional paleoenvironmental information was extracted from pollen assemblages, extracted from the Cuatro Suelos profile. The results pointed to a long period of geomorphic and climatic stability in the early-middle Holocene marked by a well-developed red Cambisol. This period was followed by an unstable interval around 4.5 kyr BP marked by severe erosion of earlier soil profiles and sedimentation of different kind: channel, floodplain, and fluvio-eolian. Later synsedimentary Fluvisols were formed showing signs of predominantly arid pedogenesis, interrupted by occasional flooding; indicators of human impact were also encountered. We conclude that the shift to irrigated agriculture as the main subsistence activity occurred during the period of major climatic and geomorphic fluctuation and then irrigation developed further under dry environment with limited water resources during the Late Holocene.

AB  - With the growth of interest in walkable neighborhoods, various efforts have been made to investigate to determine what kinds of built environment features induce physical and physiological discomfort in pedestrians in a neighborhood. Traditional evaluation approaches primarily rely on opinion surveys and field observation (e.g., neighborhood surveys and visual inspection) completed by pedestrians and trained auditors respectively, both of which require considerable time and funding. Additionally, visual audit and opinion survey methods are not free from subjectivity concerns. In this paper, we propose and test a novel approach to assess conditions of walkable environment by using body responses. The paper utilizes crowdsourced physiological data from pedestrians (e.g., gait stability, gait acceleration, and relative heart rate) to examine the interaction between built environment features and pedestrians' physical activities in a neighborhood. In an experiment conducted in Havelock neighborhood of Lincoln, Nebraska, subjects were asked to walk a pre-defined path of 1.26 km while bearing a wearable inertial measurement units (IMU) sensor, a wristband-type wearable device, and a smartphone. Additionally, subjects were asked to provide a subjective assessment of subsegments on a scale of 0 to 10. With these data, we investigate the relationship between physiological responses and the existing built environment features encountered by subjects. Our findings indicate that physiological response has a statistically significant relationship with built environment features and subjective ratings. The outcomes of the research will help improve the evaluation methods of built environment features and will promote neighborhood walkability.

AB  - The distribution of rock glaciers is often used to investigate the occurrence of permafrost in mountain areas and to understand their climate and paleoclimate evolution. This requires the creation of regional and global inventories capable of discriminating active and relict landforms in order to forecast the presence or absence of ice in the ground. In this paper, geomorphological, geophysical and microclimatic surveys are performed on a rock glacier of the Carnic Alps (Eastern European Alps). In the classification currently used for implementing regional inventories of permafrost evidence in the Alps, this rock glacier would be defined as relict. However the geophysical, climatological and geomorphological results indicate that internal ice is widespread in large portions of the rock glacier. These are generally interpreted as ice in pore spaces and local ice lenses, probably without layers of massive ice. Moreover the occurrence of ice during the maximum thawing season at depths <15 m, assumed here as the depth of zero annual amplitude, suggests that the ice occurring within the rock glacier is related to current cryotic conditions due to density driven air flow (i.e. the chimney effect). This research demonstrates that the current altitudinal limit of alpine permafrost can be locally several hundreds of meters lower than forecasted by empirical modeling based only on the rock glacier distribution and classification. Therefore, rock glacier classifications based only on remote sensing and geomorphological evidence as the main sources for extracting regional climate and paleoclimate signals should be treated with caution.

AB  - Partial melting of continental crust and evolution of granitic magmas are inseparably linked to the availability of H2O. In the absence of a free aqueous fluid, melting takes place at relatively high temperatures by dehydration of hydrous minerals, whereas in its presence, melting temperatures are lowered, and melting need not involve hydrous minerals. With the exception of anatexis in water-saturated environments where anhydrous peritectic minerals are absent, there is no reliable indicator that clearly identifies the presence of a free aqueous fluid during anatexis. Production of Ab-rich magmas or changes in LILE ratios, such as an increase in Sr and decrease in Rb indicating increased involvement of plagioclase, are rough guidelines to the presence of aqueous fluids. Nevertheless, all indicators have caveats and cannot be unequivocally applied, allowing for the persistence of a bias in the literature towards dehydration melting. Investigation of mineral equilibria modelling of three metasedimentary protoliths of the Kangaroo Island migmatites in South Australia, shows that the main indicator for the presence of small volumes of excess water under upper amphibolite to lower granulite facies conditions (660-750 degrees C) is the melt volume produced. Melt composition, modal content or chemical composition of peritectic minerals such as cordierite, sillimanite or garnet are relatively insensitive to the presence of free water. However, the mobility of melt during open system behaviour makes it difficult to determine the melt volume produced. We therefore argue that the presence of small volumes of excess water might be much more common than so far inferred, with large impact on the buffering of crustal temperatures and fertility, and therefore rheology of the continental crust.

AB  - The article analyzes the importance of innovations as one of the main factors influencing the competitiveness of enterprises and economies of the world. The study is based on the author's empirical research, grounded on the methodology of analysis of empirical data. The survey was carried out among legal entities and separate departments which operate regardless of its type. The study aimed to determine the importance of financial factors in limiting innovation activity and its potential in stimulating the innovation activity of enterprises. A survey was carried out among the enterprises on the factors that significantly influenced their decision to develop innovative projects or constrained implementation of innovation activities. The key challenges of innovation activity of enterprises were analyzed (law barriers, supply-side barriers, demand-side barriers, barrier on the demand and supply interface, lack of identified priorities, challenges of commercialization of the results of scientific and technical work, as well as weak development of infrastructure, labour problems). The research was also carried out by studying features of using financial instruments to stimulate innovation activity of enterprises, analysis of economic indicators characterizing the innovative activity of enterprises, analysis of strengths and weaknesses of innovation projects, as well as improvement of financial instruments for stimulating the implementation of innovations at enterprises. Based on the conducted research, long-, medium- and short-term directions of financial support of innovative activity were determined. Financial instruments of stimulation innovation activity of enterprises are improved based on the analysis, taking into account socio-economic, political and other particular features of country's development where such projects are implemented; studying the experience of implementing real innovative projects, analyzing strengths and weaknesses of these projects, feasibility of implementing similar projects under such conditions.

AB  - Peripheral blood eosinophilia (PBE), defined as 500 eosinophils or above per microliter (mu L) blood, is a condition that is not uncommon but often neglected in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), or patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT). The nature of PBE in the context of kidney diseases is predominantly secondary or reactive and has to be distinguished from primary eosinophilic disorders. Nonetheless, the finding of persistent PBE can be a useful clue for the differential diagnosis of underdiagnosed entities and overlapping syndromes, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), or the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). For patients on RRT, PBE may be an indicator for bio-incompatibility of the dialysis material, acute allograft rejection, or Strongyloides hyperinfection. In a subset of patients with EGPA, eosinophils might even be the driving force in disease pathogenesis. This improved understanding is already being used to facilitate novel therapeutic options. Mepolizumab has been licensed for the management of EGPA and is applied with the aim to abrogate the underlying immunologic process by blocking interleukin-5. The current article provides an overview of different renal pathologies that are associated with PBE. Further scientific effort is required to understand the exact role and function of eosinophils in these disorders which may pave the way to improved interdisciplinary management of such patients.

AB  - Previous research has identified (1) a "deficit" subtype of schizophrenia characterized by enduring negative symptoms and diminished emotionality and (2) a "distress" subtype associated with high emotionality-including anxiety, depression, and stress sensitivity. Individuals in deficit and distress categories differ sharply in development, clinical course and behavior, and show distinct biological markers, perhaps signaling different etiologies. We tested whether deficit and distress subtypes would emerge from a simple but novel data-driven subgrouping analysis, based on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative and distress symptom dimensions, and whether subgrouping was informative regarding other facets of behavior and brain function. PANSS data, and other assessments, were available for 549 people with schizophrenia diagnoses. Negative and distress symptom composite scores were used as indicators in 2-step cluster analyses, which divided the sample into low symptom (n = 301), distress (n = 121), and deficit (n = 127) subgroups. Relative to the low-symptom group, the deficit and distress subgroups had comparably higher total PANSS symptoms (Ps < .001) and were similarly functionally impaired (eg, global functioning [GAF] Ps < .001), but showed markedly different patterns on symptom, cognitive and personality variables, among others. Initial analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a 182-participant subset of the full sample also suggested distinct patterns of neural recruitment during working memory. The field seeks more neuroscience-based systems for classifying psychiatric conditions, but these are inescapably behavioral disorders. More effective parsing of clinical and behavioral traits could identify homogeneous target groups for further neural system and molecular studies, helping to integrate clinical and neuroscience approaches.

AB  - Scientific evidence has recently been used to assert that certain psychological phenomena do not exist. Such claims, however, cannot be made because (1) scientific method itself is seriously limited (i.e., it can never prove a negative); (2) non-existence of phenomena would require a complete absence of both logical (theoretical) and empirical support; even if empirical support is weak, logical and theoretical support can be strong; (3) statistical data are only one piece of evidence and cannot be used to reduce psychological phenomena to statistical phenomena; and (4) psychological phenomena vary across time, situations and persons. The human mind is unreproducible from one situation to another. Psychological phenomena are not particles that can decisively be tested and discovered. Therefore, a declaration that a phenomenon is not real is not only theoretically and empirically unjustified but runs counter to the propositional and provisional nature of scientific knowledge. There are only "temporary winners" and no "final truths" in scientific knowledge. Psychology is a science of subtleties in human affect, cognition and behavior. Its phenomena fluctuate with conditions and may sometimes be difficult to detect and reproduce empirically. When strictly applied, reproducibility is an overstated and even questionable concept in psychological science. Furthermore, statistical measures (e.g., effect size) are poor indicators of the theoretical importance and relevance of phenomena (cf. "deliberate practice" vs. "talent" in expert performance), not to mention whether phenomena are real or unreal. To better understand psychological phenomena, their theoretical and empirical properties should be examined via multiple parameters and criteria. Ten such parameters are suggested.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture is one of the significant contributors to the food security of the millennium development goals (MDGs); however, the modification of soil matrix by irrigation could alter the overall soil health due to changes in soil properties and processes. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of irrigation on soil quality status of the Ikere center pivot irrigation project site in Oyo State, southwest Nigeria. Disturbed soil samples were collected from 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90-cm layers from four different sites in three replicates, within the project location for the determination of soil bio-chemical properties. The average values of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) < 13, electrical conductivity (EC) < 4 mu S/cm, and pH < 8.5 showed that the soil condition is normal in relation to salinity and sodicity hazards. The effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations were low while the available phosphorus (P) was moderate. The principal component analysis showed EC, ECEC, SAR, SOM, and TN as the minimum data set (MDS) for monitoring and assessing the soil quality status of this irrigation field. In terms of bio-chemical properties, the soil quality index (SQI) of the field was average (about 0.543) while the sampling locations were ranked as site 2 > site 4 > site 3 > site 1 in terms of SQI. The results of this study are designated as baseline for future evaluation of soil quality status of this irrigation field and further studies should incorporate soil physical and more biological properties when considering overall soil quality status.

AB  - A new large-scale pilot hybrid treatment system of 53 m(3)/day was developed by combining 3 treatment methods: switched internal recycling flows to equalization tank (EQ); rotating hanging media bioreactor (RHMBR); and submerged flat sheet membrane bioreactor (SMBR). The system was operated for more than 16 months in a real -world municipal wastewater treatment plant, using different internal recycling ratios and observing/monitoring the results. This paper addresses not only the urgent problems of treating nutrient and organic pollutants in municipal wastewater, but also assesses characteristics of biomass production, sludge yield, and observed yield during the pilot operation. It also details design parameters used to achieve these assessed levels. Furthermore, the effects and correlations of the loading rates, activated sludge and biomass parameters, on different runs were also studied. The purpose of this was to identify the most suitable indicator for assessing the hybrid system's performance. Results strongly indicated that increasing the internal circulation rate greatly influenced the declining yield trend. The lowest biomass production (P-x,P-bio) and sludge yields (P-X,P-VSS or P-X,P-TSS) were shown for conditions in run 3, and run 4, respectively. Overall the developed treatment system performed extremely well in biological terms for actual municipal wastewater treatment and resulted in high pollutant removal efficiencies, reduced sludge production at a reasonable cost. The hybrid system is a potential option for wastewater treatment, reuse and economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Chohar Gonbad-Gugher-Baft ophiolite m,lange, located along the major Baft and Shahr-e-Babak fault zones, southeast Iran, represents remnants of Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. This m,lange contains blocks of harzburgite, dunite, lherzolite, basalt, and other ophiolite-related lithologies tectonically mixed with and embedded in a serpentinite matrix. Field, petrographic, and geochemical data show that peridotites in this m,lange belong to the upper mantle. They seem to have undergone up to similar to 20 % partial melting in a supra-subduction zone setting, based on their spinel Cr# values (0.21-0.53). Chemical compositions and textures in the serpentinites indicate that they were partially hydrated during emplacement and further mobilized diapirically to the surface. The different deformation stages occurred in an accretionary wedge environment. Petrographic evidence shows that the first serpentinization event produced mesh-textured serpentinites formed under static conditions in an ocean floor environment (Nain-Baft ocean crust), where the initial lizardite, bastite, and chrysotile veins formed. Plastic deformation occurred due to the subduction of Nain-Baft oceanic lithospheric beneath the central Iranian microcontinent, with antigorite-bearing flare-textured serpentinites produced. During progressive exhumation of the Nain-Baft ophiolite m,lange, the serpentinites were affected by ductile, ductile-brittle, and brittle deformation, respectively. Accretion and resultant diapirism are the most important processes in the emplacement of serpentinite, which is a consequence of hydration of the ocean crust. In this example, late-stage emplacement via thrusting occurred along the northern extent of the southern Sanandaj-Sirjan zone (S-SZ).

AB  - The Comet assay has been recently adapted to investigate DNA damage in insects. The first reports of its use in Drosophila melanogaster appeared in 2002. Since then, the interest in the application of the Comet assay to studies of insects has been rapidly increasing. Many authors see substantial potential in the use of the Comet assay in D. melanogaster for medical toxicology studies. This application could allow the testing of drugs and result in an understanding of the mechanisms of action of toxins, which could significantly influence the limited research that has been performed on vertebrates. The possible perspectives and benefits for science are considered in this review.
   In the last decade, the use of the Comet assay has been described in insects other than D. melanogaster. Specifically, methods to prepare a cell suspension from insect tissues, which is a difficult task, were analyzed and compared in detail. Furthermore, attention was paid to any differences and modifications in the research protocols, such as the buffer composition and electrophoresis conditions.
   Various scientific fields in addition to toxicological and ecotoxicological research were considered. We expect the Comet assay to be used in environmental risk assessments and to improve our understanding of many important phenomena of insect life, such as metamorphosis, molting, diapause and quiescence. The use of this method to study species that are of key importance to humans, such as pests and beneficial insects, appears to be highly probable and very promising. The use of the Comet assay for DNA stability testing in insects will most likely rapidly increase in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global change has affected the Antarctic Peninsula influencing the abundance of krill, one of the main preys of penguins. In areas where breeding penguin populations overlap, species with a more diverse diet have generally been less affected than krill-specialist species, which have shown population declines. Human activities can add to these changes, as penguins are sensitive to anthropic impacts such as contamination. Our objective was to assess whether selected physiological parameters of Adelie and Gentoo penguins reflect their contrasting population trends in a colony located at Punta Stranger (25 de Mayo Island/King George, South Shetland Islands) where they breed sympatrically. During 2012, we assessed the leukocyte profile, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L), erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs), hematocrit, biochemical profile, and a measure of immune function (bacterial agglutination) in adults and chicks of both species. Higher values of ENAs, indicative of genotoxic damage caused by contaminants, are in accordance with a greater sensitivity to ongoing global changes by Adelie penguins. Levels of cholesterol and triglycerides strengthen this idea since individuals could be investing more resources in energy reserves to successfully cope with challenging environmental conditions during the breeding season. The remaining physiological parameters did not provide a clear picture. Furthermore, some results could be related to differences in diet. Gentoos show greater prey diversity than Adelie penguins, incorporating a richer parasite fauna, which could explain their higher heterophils and H/L. The physiological parameters measured here serve as baseline for a sustained monitoring of these rapidly changing populations. Further physiological variables, including stress hormone and indices of oxidative stress, remain to be assessed as potential indicators of population susceptibility to global change in this system.

AB  - Repeated stress is one of the major risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, and vascular dementia. However, the functional alterations in the cerebral hemodynamic response induced by chronic stress have not been clarified. Here, we investigated the in vivo cerebral hemodynamic changes and accompanying cellular and molecular changes in chronically stressed rats. After 3 weeks of restraint stress, the elicitation of stress was verified by behavioral despair in the forced swimming test and by physical indicators of stress. The evoked changes in the cerebral blood volume and pial artery responses following hindpaw electrical stimulation were measured using optical intrinsic signal imaging. We observed that, compared to the control group, animals under chronic restraint stress exhibited a decreased hemodynamic response, with a smaller pial arterial dilation in the somatosensory cortex during hindpaw electrical stimulation. The effect of chronic restraint stress on vasomodulator enzymes, including neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), was assessed in the somatosensory cortex. Chronic restraint stress downregulated nNOS and HO-2 compared to the control group. In addition, we examined the subtypes of cells that can explain the environmental changes due to the decreased vasomodulators. The expression of parvalbumin in GABAergic interneurons and glutamate receptor-1 in neurons were decreased, whereas the microglial activation was increased. Our results suggest that the chronic stress-induced alterations in cerebral vascular function and the modulations of the cellular expression in the neuro-vasomodulatory system may be crucial contributing factors in the development of various vascular-induced conditions in the brain.

AB  - Given that nearly half the human population lives in coastal areas, we urgently need new analytical models on how to maintain the ocean's capacity to sustain our progress. This paper introduces quantitative models for assessing the human-ocean system's sustainable development (HOSSD). The quantitative assessment models, consisting of the developmental degree (DD), harmonious degree (HD), and metabolic-recycling degree (MD), are constructed. The models are applied to measure the conditions of HOSSD in 17 coastal cities in the Bohai Sea Ring Area (BSRA) from 2000 to 2011. The kernel density estimation method is employed to analyze the dynamic evolution of HOSSD. The analysis of temporal variation reveals that the sustainable development levels of the cities were beginning to exhibit a polarized tendency by 2005 and that the gaps in sustainable development increased as a whole over the period 2000 to 2011. The spatial patterns for 17 cities are divided into 4 grades: strong, medium, weak, and very weak. The cities with weak or very weak sustainable development levels are mainly located in northwestern BSRA. The main influencing factors of HOSSD differ considerably between the 17 cities and 3 groups. Our approach allows the visualization of how these dimensions of HOSSD differ from city to city, providing important insights into short-term and long-term policies that may help enhance sustainability at a particular location.

AB  - Degree days (DD) represent a versatile climatic indicator which is commonly used in the analysis of building energy performance, as e.g. (i) to perform energetic assessment of existent and new buildings, (ii) to analyze the territory energy consumption, (iii) to develop scenario analyses in terms of energy consumption forecasting, and so on.
   Different methods can be used for determining the DD values, depending on the available climatic data of each location. In the present paper, the simplified methods based on reduced climatic data set have been compared assuming the mean daily degree-hours method (MDDH) as reference. Hourly temperature profiles recorded by the meteorological station located at the University of Genoa have been used for these analyses.
   In the second part of the present work, the ASHRAE method has been selected to calculate heating (HDD) and cooling (CDD) degree days for several Italian cities. In particular, daily meteorological data of several Italian cities (covering the whole climatic conditions which occur in Italy) have been used to calculate heating and cooling degree days in the period 1978-2013, in order to analyze their trends in the last years. Finally, the historical profiles of Rome and Milan have been treated as time-series and analyzed in the frequency domain, performing a decomposition of the original data set into different characterizing components. This simplified approach permits to deeply analyze the historical profile of DD and represents a simple starting point method for future analyses with forecasting perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Mediterranean region (and globally also other regions) is characterized by the presence of phryganic plants, i.e. subshrubs that grow under hot and arid environmental conditions. These plants are reported to be affected by summer drought stress. However, in the present study the phryganic plant Teucrium polium (mountain germander) appears to be affected by winter chilling stress rather than by summer drought stress in a specific area. Winter leaves of the plant are smaller and thicker compared to summer leaves, have more stomata and glandular hairs, and their chloroplasts are larger, more numerous, with voluminous starch grains. Moreover, epidermal and mesophyll cells of winter leaves contain in their vacuoles dark phenolics and calcium oxalate crystals. Summer leaves are devoid of vacuolar phenolics and their chloroplasts possess many large plastoglobuli. Leaf gas exchange parameters (photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance) are significantly higher in winter leaves. Concentrations of osmoprotectors (stress indicators) like proline and soluble sugars are similarly higher in winter leaves. Essential oil assessments showed a significantly higher oil yield of winter leaves compared to summer leaves. Percentages of the major oil components (linalool, terpinen-4-ol, germacrene D, and spathulenol) are remarkably higher in winter oils than in summer oils. In conclusion, low environmental temperatures (1-10 A degrees C) appear to decisively influence the structure and function of winter leaves compared to summer leaves. Winter plants undergo chilling stress to which they respond by developing various mechanical and chemical defensive strategies.

AB  - The severity of the impact of a natural hazard on a society depends on, among other factors, the intensity of the hazard and the exposure and resistance ability of the elements at risk (e.g., persons, buildings and infrastructures). Social conditions strongly influence the vulnerability factors for both direct and indirect impact and therefore control the possibility to transform the occurrence of a natural hazard into a natural disaster. This article presents a model to assess the relative socioeconomic vulnerability to landslides at the local to regional scale. The model applies an indicator-based approach. The indicators represent the underlying factors that influence a community's ability to prepare for, deal with, and recover from the damage and loss associated with landslides. The proposed model includes indicators that characterize the demographic, social and economic setting as well as indicators representing the degree of preparedness, effectiveness of the response and capacity to recover. Although this model focuses primarily on the indirect losses, it could easily be extended to include physical indicators accounting for the direct losses. Each indicator is individually ranked from 1 (lowest vulnerability) to 5 (highest vulnerability) and weighted, based on its overall degree of influence. The final vulnerability estimate is formulated as a weighted average of the individual indicator scores. The proposed model is applied for six case studies in Europe. The case studies demonstrate that the method gives a reasonable ranking of the vulnerability. The practical experience achieved through the case studies shows that the model is straightforward for users with knowledge on landslide locations and with access to local census data.

AB  - Livelihood and water-related diseases are strongly linked to wetland management. The majority of wetland stakeholders in the Inner Niger Delta, Mali considered human health and sanitation the most important criteria of a list of challenges and water-related pressures. Yet, a methodology to integrate health risks and opportunities into wetland management plans has previously not been proposed, despite the clear links and substantial real-life challenges. In this paper, a framework is presented to do this in data-poor context structured around the process to evaluate and prioritise the appropriateness of management options to improve human health.
   In the data-poor context of the Inner Niger Delta, the selection of criteria and indicators, and the scoring of management options against these criteria and indicators has been done by a panel of stakeholders. Criteria were chosen to reflect the often difficult conditions in which management options need to be implemented and thus focused on the effectiveness and feasibility of management options to reduce the disease burden and the two major pathways for environmental disease transmission, namely contaminated water (pathogens) and stagnant water (parasites and organisms that can transmit them) at three wetland scales: urban areas, urban wetland and rural wetland. The feasibility for the sustainable implementation of a management option refers to the required institutional capacity and is scored by means of the concept of "adaptive capacity".
   The presented framework uses rapid assessment tools and simplified scoring methods and proved useful in explaining issues across sectors and scales, to promote mutual understanding and to achieve an integrated assessment of the appropriateness of management options.

AB  - The bioavailability of trace elements in soils is conditioned by both physico-chemical and biological parameters. In this study, the accumulation kinetics of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) were determined for 3 industrially impacted sites to assess the bioavailability of these contaminants to the garden snail (Cantareus aspersus). Mono and multivariate regressions allowed the identification of cation exchange capacity (CEC), silts and organic carbon content as the soil parameters modulating the in situ bioavailability of Cd and Pb. For all elements, the total concentrations in the soils were not good predictor (not significant correlation) of the bioavailability to snails. The Cd, As and Sb assimilation fluxes were correlated with the calcium chloride (CaCl2) extract concentrations, but this correlation was not observed with Pb. The total soil concentration coupled with soil properties best explained the variation in Pb assimilation, whereas their influences on Cd bioavailability were lower, signifying that other parameters such as contamination sources may modulate Cd bioavailability. Here, the As and Sb in situ accumulation kinetics are described for the first time and highlighted a slight bioavailability to snails at the studied sites. The absence of a correlation between the As or Sb assimilation fluxes and total metals in the soil coupled with the absence of influence of soil properties on their bioavailability may result from the speciation of these metalloids, which are known to modulate their mobility in soils. This study highlights the need to consider both physico-chemical and biological aspects of metal and metalloid bioavailability to assess the risk of metal transfer from soil to organisms.

AB  - Considerable barriers can emerge in developing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies. Understanding the nature of barriers to adaptation is important so as to find strategic ways of dealing with them. However, our current understanding is limited and highly fragmented across the academic community. This paper aims to bring some conceptual convergence in these debates by applying a systematic review method to assess the current state of knowledge on barriers to adaptation in the peer-reviewed literature. The review results show that: (1) Barriers to adaptation have hardly been defined in the literature and no clear indicators exist so as to identify and assess them systematically. (2) An impressive number of barriers have been reported, but the list of possible barriers is seemingly endless. (3) The most frequently reported barriers relate to the institutional and social dimensions of adaptation. (4) Barriers are identified as configurations of climate and non-climate factors and conditions that emerge from the actor, the governance system, or the system of concern. (5) Barriers are mainly studied in developed countries with a strong focus on water-related domains. (6) The majority of studies on barriers use small-n inductive case approaches while comparative studies across different contexts are limited. (7) Although interventions to overcome barriers are recommended by most studies, empirical studies on interventions are scarce. We present further conceptual clarification and a more precise definition of barriers to adaptation. We conclude that future research should go beyond asking the questions 'if' and 'which' barriers to adaptation exist and begin asking 'how' and 'why' barriers emerge.

AB  - The European Union increasingly integrates climate objectives into other policy areas. However, minimizing greenhouse gas emissions is not necessarily compatible with environmental protection or sustainable development, as the examples of nuclear energy, hydropower and biofuels illustrate. Therefore, climate policy integration needs to be compatible with the overarching objective of sustainable development. This article discusses under which conditions legislation that integrates climate objectives contributes to sustainable development and how this can be evaluated at the policy proposal stage. The key contribution is to illustrate in the European context how legislation on climate policy integration can be designed to also contribute to sustainable development. Based on the European Sustainable Development Strategy, this paper proposes four criteria: policy integration and coherence, environmental protection, social and economic development and justice/participation. These criteria are used to evaluate the Renewable Energy Directive and the 2014-2020 Common Agricultural Policy proposal. The paper concludes that both case studies can serve as best-practice examples for other policies on the European and national levels of how climate policy integration can be designed to also meet minimum levels of sustainable development. Policy implications are the inclusion of these criteria for sustainable climate policy integration into EU impact assessments and their use as minimum benchmarks in the policy debate as an evaluation tool that can be easily used by policy makers and stakeholders to evaluate if a negotiated compromise on a policy that integrates climate objectives still contributes to both reducing emissions and sustainable development.

AB  - Humic substances (HS) are the main pool of total soil organic carbon (TOC). They are partitioned in different fractions according to its solubility in alkali or acid medium, which can be related to soil type and management. This work aimed to compare HS partitioning in Brazilian soils according to soil depth, soil type, biome, and land uses. In a literature review of theses, dissertations, journal articles, and abstracts in proceedings, quantitative data on TOC partitioning in humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and humin (HU), as well as the HA/FA ratio were compiled. The data were sorted according to comparable depths (0-5, 5-10, 0-20, 20-50, 50-100, and > 100 cm), biomes (Atlantic rainforest, Cerrado savanna, Amazon rainforest, southern prairies, and Caatinga scrubland), soil order (Ultisols, Oxisols, Inceptisols, Entisols, Histosols and soils with aquic moisture regimes), and land use systems (native forests, prairies, pastures, eucalypt, and annual or perennial crops). Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation, and principal component analysis (PCA). In Ultisols, Oxisols, and Histosols, humin accounted for at least half of TOC and tended to decrease with depth. In Oxisols and Histosols, FA tended to increase in depth. In the Entisols, HA increased with depth, but decreased in Histosols and some Ultisols. Generally, the HA/FA decreased in the deeper layers. Results of PCA indicated no effect of biomes and land use systems on the quantitative partitioning of HS, suggesting its low potential as indicator of management effects or environmental conditions, although useful to discriminate humification processes in some soil taxa.

AB  - A case study of typhoon-induced sediment resuspension and its effects on some indicators of water quality (dissolved oxygen, pH and turbidity) and nutrient release in the large shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China, was documented, and its effect on the algal biomass was investigated. Typhoon Morakot that swept from the west of Lake Taihu in August 2009 led to a number of changes in the lake ecosystem: (1) intensive winds produced large seiches, strong waves and large wave-induced shear stress; (2) typhoon Morakot led to increased suspended solids and nutrients in the water column. Post-typhoon concentrations of suspended solid, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). NO3-N and NH4-N were 4, 2, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 1.5 times those observed in the pre-typhoon water column, respectively; and (3) during typhoon Morakot, there was no obvious stratification between the surface and bottom of the water column in chlorophyll a (Chl a), the post-typhoon Chl a concentration throughout the water column increased with a maximum daily mean of 87.8?mu g?l-1, and the algal bloom recurred. Typhoon-induced sediment resuspension could lead to both nutrient and light limitations for algal growth, whereas after the typhoon had passed, water column conditions (water temperature, solar radiation, light penetration and nutrient availability) favoured the growth and production of algae.

AB  - The forest-based sector has been at the forefront in operationally implementing the sustainability concept, its associated principles and indicators for sustainable forest management. Several methods have been developed to study environmental impacts of forestry activities, but none of the existing tools address all the dimensions of sustainability along the whole forest wood chain (FWC) in a balanced way. Consequently, the decision was made to develop a tool for sustainability impact assessment (ToSIA), the modelling framework for sustainability impact assessment of FWCs. The objective of the EU Project Eforwood was to develop ToSIA, a decision support tool. Within ToSIA, a FWC is modelled as a number of interconnected processes. For each process, a range of economic, environmental and social indicators and their respective values are calculated, thus representing the three pillars of sustainability. By this method, the multifunctionality of forests can be assessed and supply chains can be compared with respect to sustainability. Sensitivity analysis and scenario techniques can be applied to learn about the effect of expected changes to the structure of the chain, the material flows and the indicator values. In order to provide the tool with information about forest and logging operations, data were collected at two fundamental levels: (1) a regional level with case studies in Scandinavia, Iberia and Baden-Wurttemberg and (2) a European level with a case study that reflects conditions in the 27 countries of the European Union. This paper describes and details the harvesting and logging processes for the European countries. The results are displayed for each of the three regional case studies as well as aggregated to five principal areas in Europe: Eastern, Northern, Western, Central and Southwest Europe.

AB  - The current recreational water quality criteria using growth-based measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentration have their limitations for swimmer protection. To evaluate the possible use of enteric viruses as an improved indicator of human sewage contamination in recreational waters for enhanced health risk assessment, human norovirus (huNoV) was tested as a model in this study. To establish a highly sensitive protocol for effective huNoV detection in waters, 16 published and newly designed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primer pairs specific for huNoV genogroup I (GI) and genogroup II (GII) were comparatively evaluated side-by-side using single sources of huNoV RNA stock extracted from local clinical isolates. Under optimized conditions, these RT-PCR protocols shared a very different pattern of detection sensitivity for huNoV. The primer sets COG2F/COG2R and QNIF4/NV1LCR were determined to be the most sensitive ones for huNoV GII and GI, respectively, with up to 10(5)- and 10(5)-fold more sensitive as compared to other sets tested. These two sensitive protocols were validated by positive detection of huNoV in untreated and treated urban wastewater samples. In addition, these RT-PCR protocols enabled detection of the prevalence of huNoV in 5 (GI) and 10 (GII) of 16 recreational water samples collected around the island of O'ahu, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. Findings from this study support the possible use of enteric viral pathogens for environmental monitoring and argue the importance and essentiality for such monitoring activity to ensure a safe use of recreational waters.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence Imaging and Microscopy PAM fluorometry were applied to study spatial dynamics of photosystem II quantum yield Delta F/F'(m) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in resting and electrically stimulated Chara corallina cells in the absence and presence of the hydrophilic electron acceptor methyl viologen (MV) in the external medium. Electrical excitation of the plasma membrane temporarily enhanced the heterogeneity of photosynthetic patterns under physiological conditions (in the absence of MV), but irreversibly eliminated these patterns in the presence of MV. These findings suggest that the action potential (AP) of the excitable plant cell affects the spatial patterns of photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence through different pathways operated in the absence and presence of MV. Based on the extent of NPQ as an indicator of MV-dependent electron flow, it is supposed that MV cannot permeate into the chloroplasts of photosynthetically active "acid cell regions" but gains an immediate access to the stroma of these chloroplasts after triggering of an AP. The AP-triggered MV-dependent non-photochemical quenching in the chloroplasts of acidic cell regions was routinely observed at 0.1 mM Ca2+ in the medium but not at elevated (2 mM) external Ca2+ concentration. The results are interpreted in terms of competition between two permeant divalent ion species, Ca2+ and MV2+, for their passage through the voltage-gated calcium channels of the plasma membrane. It is proposed that the herbicidal activity of MV in characean cells, here serving as model object, can be manipulated by triggering AP and varying Ca2+ concentration in the environmental medium.

AB  - Anthropogenic enrichment of aquatic ecosystems is an increasingly common phenomenon, resulting from human population growth and the intensification of industrial and agricultural developments. Eutrophication has been considered to be one of the main causes of the decline of many aquatic plants. These observations, however, have rarely been supported by data or explored in detail using an experimental approach. Our experimental study demonstrates, for the first time, a strong direct negative influence of eutrophication on the performance of the endangered aquatic plant Baldellia ranunculoides s.str. (L.) Parl. (Alismataceae). Both morphological and reproductive traits were significantly affected by this phenomenon. Plants growing on eutrophic substrates were much smaller, possessed fewer and smaller leaves, and their biomass was on average half that of plants growing on a mesotrophic substrate. Additionally, plants growing on eutrophic substrates produced fewer inflorescences and flowers, and they had a smaller number of achenes per capitulum. Consequently, they produced only 15% of the seeds produced by plants growing in non-eutrophic conditions. Thus, the chance of long-term subsistence of B. ranunculoides populations in strongly eutrophic habitats will be significantly reduced, and at the same time, the success of any new establishment of viable B. ranunculoides populations in such habitats will be highly restricted. Conservation efforts for B. ranunculoides, either of existing populations or in newly selected re-introduction sites, should start, therefore, with an assessment of the trophic level of those sites. On the other hand, due to its sensitivity to eutrophication, the presence of viable populations of B. ranunculoides can be used as an indicator of valuable aquatic habitats for oligotrophy-dependent organisms.

AB  - pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) carried in biosolids may reach surface waters or ground water when these materials are applied as fertilizer to agricultural land. During preferential flow conditions created by land application of liquid Municipal biosolids (LMB), the residence time Of Solutes in the macropores may be too short for sorption equilibration. The physically based dual-permeability model MACRO is used in environmental risk assessments for pesticides and may have potential as an environmental risk assessment tool for PPCPs. The objective of this study was to evaluate MACRO and an updated version of MACRO that included non-equilibrium sorption in macropores using data from experiments conducted in eastern Ontario, Canada on the transport of three PPCPs (atenolol, carbamazepine, and triclosan), the nicotine metabolite cotinine, and the strongly sorbing dye rhodamine WT applied in LMB. Results showed that the MACRO model could not reproduce the measured rhodamine WT concentrations (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient [NS] for the best simulation = -0.057) in drain discharge. The updated version resulted in better fits to measured data for PPCP (average NS = 0.97) and rhodamine WT (NS = 0.84) concentrations. However, it was not possible to simulate all compounds using the same set of hydraulic parameters, which indicates that the model does not fully account for all relevant processes. The results presented herein show that non-equilibrium sorption in macropores has a large impact on simulated solute transport for reactive compounds contained in LMB. This process should be considered in solute transport models that are used for environmental risk assessments for such compounds.

AB  - In the last decade, the treatment of high ammoniacal concentration effluents has become of great interest. Various effluents can contain some hundred milligrams of nitrogen per litre (supernatants from anaerobic digestion, leachates from municipal landfill, ...) may need specific treatment before recycling them to the plant inlet. Partial nitrification process, leading to nitrites accumulation, is proposed here in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) at 30 degrees C. This reaction is carried out by maintaining strong ammoniacal concentrations (sequencing feed) which have the role of inhibiting the nitrite-oxidizing population responsible for the oxidation of nitrites into nitrates (final stage of nitrification). During the first experiments, nitrites accumulation has been obtained quite rapidly but the presence of nitrates has been noticed after 30-40 days. Consequently, the process had to be controlled and optimized. The mode of controlling the process, mainly based on the on-line determination of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR), indicator of the bacterial activity, leads to a maximal removed nitrogen load of 2 kg N m(-3) d(-1), with 100% of conversion of ammonium into nitrite during 190 days.
   A simplified mathematical model is proposed to describe the biological reactions taking place in the process, in order to determine the optimum conditions of experiment to obtain a stable nitrite accumulation without nitrate production. This model represents several features, such as the inhibition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria by its substrate NH3 and product HNO2, and the inhibition of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria by free ammonia (NH3). It appears that the model correctly describes this nitritation process in sequencing batch reactor. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to investigate whether exposure to toxicant mixtures is associated with fish assemblage characteristics in the field and to describe the relationships between predicted chronic and acute mixture risks and observed impacts. Fish abundance and abiotic monitoring data from Ohio, USA, surface waters were compiled and analyzed. Variability of biotic and abiotic parameters was large. Exposure assessment, risk assessment with species-sensitivity distributions, and mixture toxicity rules were used to calculate a relative risk predictor: The multisubstance potentially affected fraction of species (msPAF). Predicted acute and chronic risks ranged from low values to more than 10 and 50% of species potentially affected, respectively. Pearson correlations between predicted risk and observed assemblage characteristics were nonsignificant for total abundance, number of species, Shannon-Weaver index, and evenness. Moderately significant correlations were found between predicted risk and abundance for 23% of individual species. Both abundance increases and decreases were observed. Generalized linear model (GLM) regressions revealed significant nonlinear associations between predicted risk and the abundance for 50% (metals and ammonia) and 55% (household product ingredients) of the species. Local ecological impact was expressed as the fraction of species expected but not observed, both with and without attribution of impact to mixture exposure. The association between predicted impacted fraction and the fraction of species expected but not observed was not significant. Predicted acute and chronic impacted fractions were associated significantly with the observed fraction of species likely lost by the action of toxicant mixtures under field conditions, with wide confidence bounds. These findings confirm the view that higher mixture impacts are expected in the field at higher msPAF.

AB  - Accretionary hard parts of many organisms provide excellent archives of past climate and environmental conditions or life history traits. Variable growth rates function as environmental and physiological proxies, and growth increments as calendars. Recognition of growth structures is thus a prime necessity for sclerochronological studies. Here we present a new, handy, easy-to-use and time-efficient technique that resolves annual and sub-annual growth structures in skeletons of a wide range of different organisms. Mutvei's solution simultaneously etches biogenic carbonates and calcium phosphates, fixates the soluble and insoluble organic matrices and fibers, and stains mucopolysaccharides. It produces a filigreed three-dimensional relief of etch-resistant ridges (growth lines) and etched depressions (growth increments) and stains skeletal growth structures in shadings of blue. Growth lines stand out as crisp, darker-blue stained lines. Reflected optical light microscopy (axial and oblique illumination) and scanning electron microscopy can be used to analyze the microgrowth structures. We demonstrate the use of the technique on hard tissues of various marine and freshwater bivalves, a coral, a sclerosponge, a barnacle, gastropods, a cephalopod, a fish otolith and a whale's ear bone. This technique may be of interest for paleoclimatologists, geochemists and biologists. It can significantly expand the use of biogenic hard parts as environmental and physiological indicators because it reveals microgrowth structures of biogenic skeletons that potentially form on a periodic basis and thus function as calendars.

AB  - To determine the nature of intracellular Mg2+ stores and Mg2+ release mechanisms in differentiated PC12 cells, Mg2+ and Ca2+ mobilizations were measured simultaneously in living cells with KMG-104, a fluorescent Mg2+ indicator, and fura-2, respectively. Treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), increased both the intracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+](i)) and the [Ca2+](i) in these cells. Possible candidates as intracellular Mg2+ stores under these conditions include intracellular divalent cation binding sites, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Mg-ATP and mitochondria. Given that no change in [Mg2+](i) was induced by caffeine application, intracellular IP3 or Ca2+ liberated by photolysis, it appears that no Mg2+ release mechanism thus exists that is mediated via the action of Ca2+ on membrane-bound receptors in the ER or via the offloading of Mg2+ from binding sites as a result of the increased [Ca2+](i). FCCP treatment for 2 min did not alter the intracellular ATP content, indicating that Mg2+ was not released from Mg-ATP, at least in the first 2 min following exposure to FCCP. FCCP-induced [Mg2+](i) increase was observed at mitochondria localized area, and vice versa. These results suggest that the mitochondria serve as the intracellular Mg2+ store in PC12 cell. Simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+](i) and mitochondrial membrane potential, and also of [Ca2+](i) and [Mg2+](i), revealed that the initial rise in [Mg2+](i) followed that of mitochondrial depolarization for several seconds. These findings show that the source of Mg2+ in the FCCP-induced [Mg2+](i) increase in PC12 cells is mitochondria, and that mitochondrial depolarization triggers the Mg2+ release.

AB  - Apolipoprotein-E (apo-E) genotyping has been investigated as an indicator of susceptibility to heavy metal (i.e., lead) neurotoxicity. Moreover, the apo-E epsilon (epsilon)4 allele is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A theoretical biochemical basis for this risk factor is discussed herein, supported by data from 400 patients with presumptive mercury-related neuro-psychiatric symptoms and in whom apo-E determinations were made. A statistically relevant shift toward the at-risk apo-E epsilon 4 groups was found in the patients (p < 0.001). The patients possessed a mean of 13.7 dental amalgam fillings and 31.5 amalgam surfaces. This far exceeds the number capable of producing the maximum identified tolerable daily intake of mercury from amalgam.
   The clinical diagnosis and proof of chronic low-level mercury toxicity has been difficult due to the non-specific nature of the symptoms and signs. Dental amalgam is the greatest source of mercury in the general population and brain, blood and urine mercury levels increase correspondingly with the number of amalgams and amalgam surfaces in the mouth. Confirmation of an elevated body burden of mercury can be made by measuring urinary mercury, after provocation with 2,3,-dimercapto-propane sulfonate (DMPS) and this was measured in 150 patients.
   Apo-E genotyping warrants investigation as a clinically useful biomarker for those at increased risk of neuropathology, including AD, when subjected to long-term mercury exposures. Additionally, when clinical findings suggest adverse effects of chronic mercury exposure, a DMPS urine mercury challenge appears to be a simple, inexpensive procedure that provides objective confirmatory evidence. An opportunity could now exist for primary health practitioners to help identify those at greater risk and possibly forestall subsequent neurological deterioration.

KW  - NORTHERN CHILE
AB  - Nomad was deployed for a 45 day traverse in the Atacama Desert, Chile, during the summer of 1997. During this traverse, I week was devoted to science experiments. The goal of the science experiments was to test different planetary surface exploration strategies that included(l) a Mars mission simulation, (2) a science on the fly experiment, where the rover was kept moving 75% of the operation time. (The goal of this operation was to determine whether or not successful interpretation of the environment is related to the time spent on a target. The role of mobility in helping the interpretation was also assessed.) (3) a meteorite search using visual and instrumental methods to remotely identify meteorites in extreme environments, and (4) a time-delay experiment with and without using the panospheric camera. The results were as follow: the remote science team positively identified the main characteristics of the test site geological environment. The science on the fly experiment showed that the selection of appropriate targets might be even more critical than the time spent on a study area to reconstruct the history of a site. During the same operation the science team members identified and sampled a rock from a Jurassic outcrop that they proposed to be a fossil. The presence of paleolife indicators in this rock was confirmed later by laboratory analysis. Both visual and instrumental modes demonstrated the feasibility, in at least some conditions, of carrying out a field search for meteorites by using remote-controlled vehicles. Finally, metrics collected from the observation of the science team operations, and the use team members made of mission data, provided critical information on what operation sequences could be automated on board revers in future planetary surface explorations.

AB  - The distribution of facies and benthic fauna in segments of the marine Early Jurassic Andean Basin of northern Chile has been reconstructed based on sedimentological, taphonomic, and paleoecological evidence. In the areas studied, that is between Salar de Pedernales (26-degrees-S) and El Transito (29-degrees-S), the depositional system is interpreted as a homoclinal ramp, on which four environmental subdivisions can be distinguished: shallow siliciclastic ramp, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp, middle carbonate ramp, and deep carbonate ramp. In an off shore direction, they reflect a general decrease in terrigenous sediment input, energy level, grain-size, and oxygen supply, and a relative increase in carbonate production. More than 200 bulk collections of benthic macroinvertebrates, dominated by bivalves and brachiopods, were grouped into 27 associations (1-27) and 3 assemblages (E, F, G) by means of a Q-mode cluster-analysis. Most associations are restricted to a single environmental subdivision and therefore proved to be useful indicators of general environmental conditions and bathymetry. This is also true for guild-assemblages. Higher numbers of dominant guilds and a relatively broad guild-spectrum within highly-diverse associations are found in the more on shore settings. Due to a stable and consolidated substrate, on the middle carbonate ramp only pedunculate brachiopods and epifaunal bivalves could gain high abundances in associations of moderate diversity. An even higher dominance of only a few guilds is found on the oxygen-controlled deep ramp. Typical representatives of low-diversity associations were deposit-feeding nuculid bivalves in the upper dysaerobic biofacies zone and small, flat-valved pectinacean bivalves in the lower dysaerobic zone.

AB  - The Earth's mantle has provided a ready redox gradient of sulfur compounds (SO2, H2S) since the stabilization of the crust and formation of the ocean over 4 billion years ago, and life has evolved a multitude of metabolic pathways to take advantage of this gradient. These transitions are recorded in the sulfur and carbon isotope signals preserved in the rock record, in the genomic records of extant microorganisms, and in the changing mantle and crust structure, composition and cycling. Here, we have assembled approximately 20,000 sulfur (delta S-34, Delta S-33, Delta S-36) and carbon (delta C-13) isotope data points from scientific publications spanning over five decades of geochemical analyses on rocks deposited from 4.0 to 1.5 Ga. We place these data in the context of molecular clock and tectonic and surface redox indicators to identify overarching trends and integrate them into a holistic narrative on the transition of the Earth's surface towards more oxidizing conditions. The greatest extreme in delta S-34 values of sulfide minerals (45.5 to 54.9 parts per thousand) and sulfate minerals (-13.6 to 46.6 parts per thousand) as well as delta C-13 values in carbonate minerals (-16.8 to 29.6 parts per thousand) occurred in the period following the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), while the greatest extremes in organic carbon 513C values (60.9 to 2.4 parts per thousand) and sulfide and sulfate mineral Delta S-33 and Delta S-36 values (-4.0 to 14.3 parts per thousand and -12.3 to 3.2 parts per thousand, respectively) occurred prior to the GOE. From our observations, we divide transitions in Earth's history into four periods: Period 1 (4.00 to 2.80 Ga) during which geochemical cycles were initialized, Period 2 (2.80 to 2.45 Ga) during which S and C isotope systems exhibit changes as conditions build up to the GOE, Period 3 (2.45 to 2.00 Ga) encompassing the GOE, and Period 4 (after 2.00 Ga) after which S and C isotopic systems remained relatively constant marking a time of Earth system geochemical quiescence. Using these periods, we link changes in S and C isotopes to molecular clock work to aid in interpreting emerging metabolic functions throughout Earth's history while underscoring the need for better proxies for robust evolutionary analyses. Specifically, results indicate: 1) an early development of sulfide oxidation and dissimilatory sulfite reduction followed by disproportionation and then sulfate reduction to sulfite resulting in a fully biologically mediated sulfur cycle by similar to 3.25 Ga; 2) support for the acetyl coenzyme-A pathway as the most likely earliest form of biologically mediated carbon fixation following methanogenesis; 3) an increasingly redox-stratified ocean in the Neoarchean with largely oxic surface water and euxinic bottom water during the first half of the Paleoproterozoic; and 4) that secular changes in Earth system crustal cycling dynamics and continent formation likely played a key role in driving the timing of the GOE. Finally, based on geochemical data, we suggest that the Paleoproterozoic be divided into a new Era of the Eoproterozoic (from 2.45 to 2.00 Ga) and the Paleoproterozoic (from 2.00 to 1.60 Ga).

AB  - Subsea wellhead connector is the vital equipment that connects the subsea Christmas tree and the subsea wellhead, it can prevent the leakage in the high temperature and pressure oil and gas passage, support metal seals, and bear complex loads. But due to the fact that subsea wellhead connectors have complex working conditions and harsh working environment, it's necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of its structure. This paper presents a methodology integrating FEA and DBN for fault diagnosis of fatigue cracks of subsea wellhead connectors with material aging. Considering the material strength aging over time and its structural reliability in the case of internal crack failure. Based on the crack size propagation theory, this paper analyzed the growth process from the initial crack to the critical crack size, and then established the Dynamic Bayesian network of the subsea wellhead connector considering the internal crack propagation. Through the above the method, the reliability of subsea wellhead connector is obtained, such as the structural influence of multi-factor variables on the failure probability. It is concluded that the structural failure probability of the subsea wellhead connector increases from 0.0228 to 0.2075 after 30 years of service in the case of cracks. In the absence of the relevant data, this paper presents a reference method for failure reliability assessment of mechanical structures considering material degradation and crack propagation, which can provide failure data to the fault diagnosis and digital twin of the subsea wellhead connector in the future.

AB  - Aims: This study aims to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on shrimp microbiome in a biodiverse mangrove forest ecosystem, along the Merbok River, Kedah, Malaysia.
   Methodology and results: To assess the impacts, a microbiome study of wild post larvae shrimps along the river was conducted as a health indicator of the shrimp hosts which in turn would reflect the river conditions. A 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the wild post larvae shrimp microbiomes sampled across areas of varying human activities was conducted. Samples were obtained from four sites ranging from upstream river habitat to downstream brackish water towards the marine coast. Individuals detected from the sequence were then counted and their relative abundance of bacterial diversity were compared. All abundances are up to 100% and the diversity indices were calculated using proportions of each species. The Operational Taxonomy Unit (OTUs) were obtained by using USEARCH and UPARSE software. Twenty-eight bacterium phyla were detected, dominated by phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at each site. Eighteen families were dominant at each site with Streptomycetaceae being the major abundant. At the genus level, the most abundant genera were Streptomyces sp., Mesorhizobium sp., Rhizobium sp., Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp.
   Conclusion, significance and impact of study: In general, the diversity of opportunistic and coliform bacteria was low. Thus, despite being exposed to various levels of human activities, the Merbok River and its mangrove surroundings still serve as a good spawning and nursery sites of shrimps and presumably other inhabitants.

AB  - For the first time the development of an electrochemical method for simultaneous quantification of Zn2+ and uric acid (UA) in sweat is described using an electrochemically treated 3D-printed working electrode. Sweat analysis can provide important information about metabolites that are valuable indicators of biological processes. Improved performance of the 3D-printed electrode was achieved after electrochemical treatment of its surface in an alkaline medium. This treatment promotes the PLA removal (insulating layer) and exposes carbon black (CB) conductive sites. The pH and the square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry technique were carefully adjusted to optimize the method. The peaks for Zn2+ and UA were well-defined at around - 1.1 V and + 0.45 V (vs. CB/PLA pseudo-reference), respectively, using the treated surface under optimized conditions. The calibration curve showed a linear range of 1 to 70 mu g L-1 and 1 to 70 mu mol L-1 for Zn2+ and UA, respectively. Relative standard deviation values were estimated as 4.8% (n = 10, 30 mu g L-1) and 6.1% (n = 10, 30 mu mol L-1) for Zn2+ and UA, respectively. The detection limits for Zn2+ and UA were 0.10 mu g L-1 and 0.28 mu mol L-1, respectively.

AB  - Aerobic respiration and oxygen consumption are indicators of routine metabolic rate, and dissolved oxygen in plant tissues is one of the most important environmental factors affecting their survival. The reduction of available O-2 leads to hypoxia which causes a limitation of the oxidative phosphorylation; when O-2 is absent, tissues generate ATP by activating the fermentative glycolysis to sustain glycolysis in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, which results in the production of lactate. Overall, hypoxia was reported to often decrease the respiration rate (O-2 uptake) and delay the climacteric rise of ethylene in climacteric fruits by inhibiting action, thus delaying their ripening. Much research has been done on the application of postharvest hypoxia and anoxia treatment to temperate fresh crops (controlled or modified atmosphere), however, very few reported on tropical commodities. Indeed, the physiological mode of action of low or absence of oxygen in fresh crops is not well understood; and the physiological and biochemical bases of the effects low or absence of O-2 are also yet to be clarified. Recent investigations using omics technologies, however, have provided useful information on the response of fresh fruits and vegetables to this abiotic stress. The aims of this review are to (i) report on the oxygen exchange in the crops tissue, (ii) discuss the metabolic responses to hypoxia and anoxia, and (iii) report the physiological and biochemical responses of crops tissues to these abiotic stresses and the potential benefits of these environmental conditions.

AB  - Changing environmental conditions in the Arctic make it important to document and understand habitat preferences and flexibility of vulnerable high-latitude mammals. Indirect proxies are especially useful for elusive species, such as rodents. This study explores incisor microwear as an indicator of variation in behavior and microhabitat use in Siberian lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus) and narrow-headed voles (Lasiopodomys gregalis) from the Yamal Peninsula, Russia. Fifty-nine individuals were sampled at four sites along a latitudinal gradient from forest-tundra ecotone to high-Arctic tundra. Lemmings are present at the northernmost site, voles at the southernmost site, and both species at the middle two. Lemmus sibiricus prefers wet, mossy lowland, whereas La. gregalis favors drier thickets and more open microhabitats and burrows underground. Feature-based analyses indicate higher densities of features and more uniformly oriented striations for voles than lemmings at sites with both species. The species also differ significantly in microwear texture attributes suggesting larger features for lemmings, and smaller ones, but more of them, for voles. While no texture differences were found between sites within species, voles from sites with open tundra have higher striation densities than those from the forest-tundra ecotone. Furthermore, lemmings from open tundra sites have higher striation densities than those from the water-saturated, moss-covered northernmost site. While microhabitat preferences and burrowing by voles likely contribute to differences between species, variation within seems to reflect habitat variation given differences in abrasive loads between sites. This suggests that incisor microwear patterning can be used to track microhabitat differences among Arctic rodent populations.

AB  - The extraction processes of olive oil produce huge amounts of by-products, such as olive mill wastewater (OMWW) and olive mill pomace (OMP), these by-products have significant polluting properties related to their undesirable color and odor, high organic load, acidic pH, high phenolic compounds, high salinity, while their effect on soil organisms is unclear. The study into the effects of these by-products on soil bioindicators, such as earthworms should therefore be prioritized. Indeed, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of environmentally realistic concentrations of olive mill wastewater and olive mill pomace on the growth, reproduction, and survival of the earthworms Aporrectodea trapezoides, and Eisenia fetida. Bioindicators were exposed under laboratory conditions to increasing doses (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% w/w) of OMWW and OMP separately and in combination. The results showed a higher growth rate on Eisenia fetida when exposed to 12.5% OMP, with a neutral effect on reproduction and survival. Toxicological effects were found at higher doses, namely: there was no cocoon production, growth inhibition, and mortality; these effects were probably due to the higher level of phenolic compounds and higher salinity. In general OMP was found to have toxicity higher than OMWW, the combination of both by-products showed stronger effects on some earthworm endpoints. Comparative responses between the two species showed that Aporrectodea trapezoides proved to be more tolerant. Dilution and bioremediation of these by-products is recommended as a possible solution to reduce their toxicity.

AB  - Industrial production creates material conditions for mankind, but also seriously pollutes the environment. In order to avoid pollution damage to the atmosphere, water, sound, and other environments, environmental impact assessments must be carried out before the project starts, and possible environmental pollution factors must be analyzed and predicted in advance. Company A, a manufacturer of mechanical parts, plans to build a new surface treatment production line, including two production links: anodizing and painting. The product coefficient method and the material balance method were used to evaluate and analyze the environmental pollution factors such as waste gas, wastewater, noise, solid waste, and discarded bath solution discharged during the operation period of the production line. The evaluation results show that after chromium mist recovery, spraying, filtration, and activated carbon adsorption and other measures are concentrated treatment, the concentration of various exhaust gas discharged in an organized manner is lower than the standard limit; various wastewater can be recycled after being filtered by ion exchange resin and activated carbon use, a very small amount of concentrated liquid needs to be handled by an external professional unit, and a cofferdam is installed under the production line and the ground is strengthened to prevent leakage, which will not pollute the groundwater environment; the noise level on the four plant boundaries during the operation of the production line meets the noise standard. No noise pollution will be generated; solid waste and discarded bath solutions are centrally stored by the enterprise and entrusted to an external professional unit for processing, and no other pollution will be generated.

AB  - Exosomes are membrane-bound, cell-secreted vesicles, with sizes ranging from 30 to 150 nm. Exosomes in blood plasma have become proposed targets as measurable indicators of disease conditions. Current methods for plasma-based exosome isolation are time-consuming, complex, and have high operational costs. One of the most commonly reported shortcomings of current isolation protocols is the co-extraction of lipoproteins (e.g. low-density lipoproteins, LDLs) with the target exosomes. This report describes the use of a rapid, single-operation hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) procedure on a polyester (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fiber column, demonstrating the ability to efficiently purify exosomes. The method has previously been demonstrated for isolation of exosomes from diverse biological matrices, but questions were raised about the potential co-elution of LDLs. In the method described herein, a step-gradient procedure sequentially elutes spiked lipoproteins and blood plasma-originating exosomes in 10 min, with the LDLs excluded from the desired exosome fraction. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to characterize an impurity in the primary LDL material, identifying the presence of exosomal material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to identify the various elution components. The method serves both as a rapid means of high purity exosome isolation as well as a screening tool for the purity of LDL samples with respect to extracellular vesicles. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Droplet sliding naturally happens with practical significance in developing artificial self-cleaning surfaces or impermeable barriers. On water-repellent soil surfaces, such processes evolve at very small scales, typically at the particle level. To address this, this paper presents a two-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann (LB) study on the droplet sliding dynamics on a layer of regularly arranged particles with varying size and contact angle (CA) aimed at mimicking conditions comparable to those of real soils. The numerical droplet is initialized above the inclined granular surface with different lifting distances and deposited by gravity. The droplet hits the surface with different impacting velocities and subsequently slides down the slope. Four droplet-sliding behaviors were observed: a droplet sticks to the granular surface, a droplet moves by pinning and depinning of its interface ("stick-slip"), a droplet undergoes periodic elongation and shortening during sliding, and a droplet lifts off the granular surface and may be ruptured. For a droplet that displays the "stick-slip" behavior, the sliding velocity reaches a converged terminal velocity, which increases with a higher CA, a more inclined slope, and a smaller particle size. However, nonunique terminal velocities were identified to be affected by the impacting velocities, but their correlation is not continuous and may not be positive. Finally, we propose to quantify the rotational or translational movement by effective kinematic ratio (EKR), which is defined as the translational kinematic energy divided by the total kinematic energy. The unique relation between the EKR and the terminal velocity is suggested to be one practical indicator to intrinsically characterize the water repellency at the particle level.

AB  - Understanding the relationship of stand structural complexity and forest management is relevant to create desired stand structures by adapting management strategies under changing disturbance scenarios and climatic conditions. To overcome difficulties in differentiating between strict categories of silvicultural practices and to describe the impact of forest management more appropriate, we used a continuous indicator of forest management intensity (ForMI). The ForMI consists of three components including volumes of natural deadwood, non-native tree species and harvested trees. There are a great number of approaches to quantify stand structure; here we used the recently established stand structural complexity index (SSCI) which represents a density-dependent as well as vertical measure of complexity based on the distribution of points in 3D space inventoried by terrestrial laser scanning. The data collection took place in 135 one-hectare plots managed under close-to-nature forest management (CTNFM) located in the Black Forest, Germany. We build generalized additive models to test the relationship of the SSCI with the ForMI. The model results did not prove a significant relationship between the SSCI and the ForMI, but components of the ForMI showed significant relationships to the SSCI. Our results indicate that the relationship between stand structural complexity and forest management intensity is, while plausible, not trivial to demonstrate. We conclude that forest managers have a relatively wide range of choices in CTNFM to adapt forests within a similar range of management intensity as presented here to future challenges, since management intensity does not change the forest structure drastically.

AB  - Carbon fibre reinforced composites (CFRC) continue to play a key role in the growth and development of many weight sensitive industries. However, their proliferation has raised increasing concerns regarding the required practices and strategies to deal with these expensive engineered structures at the end of their life cycle. This has brought into focus the need to develop more sustainable and efficient recycling solutions for these products. Similarly, the necessity of managing dry carbon fibre scraps generated during the manufacturing process of CFRC has attracted more attention in recent years. This review article provides an overview on recent advances in recycling CFRC as well as processing dry carbon fibre scraps. Influential parameters, advantages, drawbacks, and possible environmental impacts of the main technologies of processing CFRC waste including mechanical, thermal (pyrolysis and fluidised bed), and chemical (solvolysis and low temperature chemical processing) will be evaluated. Their potential effects on mechanical characteristics and surface chemistry of fibres are assessed. Moreover, recent processing methods of dry and semi-finished carbon fibre scrap are also reviewed. Specific attention is paid to the recent developments in producing hybrid yarns and nonwovens made of waste carbon fibre. The methodologies developed in this area, their processing conditions, as well as other important findings are discussed. This review paper provides a valuable platform for researchers and decision makers working in the field of carbon fibre by providing a clearer picture on the options available to recycle CFRC, and the methods of developing value-added products using waste carbon fibre.

AB  - Identifying disease-specific patterns of retinal cell loss in pathological conditions has been highlighted by the emergence of techniques such as Detection of Apoptotic Retinal Cells and Adaptive Optics confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy which have enabled single-cell visualisation in vivo. Cell size has previously been used to stratify Retinal Ganglion Cell (RGC) populations in histological samples of optic neuropathies, and early work in this field suggested that larger RGCs are more susceptible to early loss than smaller RGCs. More recently, however, it has been proposed that RGC soma and axon size may be dynamic and change in response to injury. To address this unresolved controversy, we applied recent advances in maximising information extraction from RGC populations in retinal whole mounts to evaluate the changes in RGC size distribution over time, using three well-established rodent models of optic nerve injury. In contrast to previous studies based on sampling approaches, we examined the whole Brn3a-positive RGC population at multiple time points over the natural history of these models. The morphology of over 4 million RGCs was thus assessed to glean novel insights from this dataset. RGC subpopulations were found to both increase and decrease in size over time, supporting the notion that RGC cell size is dynamic in response to injury. However, this study presents compelling evidence that smaller RGCs are lost more rapidly than larger RGCs despite the dynamism. Finally, using a bootstrap approach, the data strongly suggests that disease-associated changes in RGC spatial distribution and morphology could have potential as novel diagnostic indicators.

AB  - Hydrological change is a conspicuous signal of land use intensification in human-dominated landscapes. We hypothesized that land conversion and land use change increase the availability of lentic habitats and associated biodiversity in Southern Amazonian landscapes through at least four drivers. River damming promotes the formation of reservoirs, which are novel permanent lentic water bodies. A rise in the water table driven by local deforestation promotes the expansion of shallow riparian floodplains. Soil compaction and the deliberate construction of cattle and drainage ponds promote the increase in temporary water bodies in interfluves. We tested these hypotheses using data on habitat characterization and biological surveys of amphibians and fish in forests, pastures and soybean fields in the headwaters of the Xingu River in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Lentic habitat availability sharply increased in deforested land, with consequences to freshwater biodiversity. Reservoir formation influenced both fish and amphibian assemblage structure. Fish species ranged from strongly favored to strongly disfavored by reservoir conditions. Amphibian richness and abundance increased in pasture and soybean streams relative to forests in proportion to the density of reservoirs in the landscape. Expansion of stream floodplains increased the abundance of Melanorivulus megaroni, a fish species indicator of shallow lentic habitats. Rainwater accumulation in temporary ponds and puddles, absent from well-drained forested interfluves, allowed the invasion of converted interfluves by twelve species of open-area amphibians. A literature review indicates that these four drivers of hydrological change are geographically widespread suggesting that we may be witnessing a major yet previously unaccounted form of habitat change in deforested Amazonia, affecting both biodiversity and human health.

AB  - Moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.) is a high value, multiuse tree species in tropical and subtropical regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different levels of N, P, and K fertilizations on the biomass yield of moringa. Five levels of N (0 to 2200 kg ha(-1)) were tested either with a fixed N:P:K ratio of 2:1:1, or tested in factorial combination with two levels of P (0 and 290 kg ha(-1)) and three levels of K (0, 290, and 580 kg ha(-1)). The biomass yield showed a quadruple increase with the N fertilization levels (R-2 = 0.96 and 0.62 for fixed and factorial combination of N, P and K, respectively; P < 0.001). In the factorial experiment, N, P, and K fertilizations each had significant effects on the biomass yield with an interaction effect between N and P. The highest biomass occurred at 290 kg P and K ha(-1). The maximum biomass yield was achieved from applying N at 1425 kg ha(-1). The actual timing of the N application requires further study based on uptake and soil conditions. At the high N rates, available P at 25 ppm appeared to be sufficient in this study. The critical level of tissue N content was 2.75%. Marginal increase in biomass could be achieved with extra inputs of N, P, and K above the sufficient levels. However, the feasibility of maximizing N, P, and K is questionable based on the economic and environmental assessments.

AB  - Considering the hypothesis that density and dry matter (DM) concentration may be used as indicators of silage nutritional quality, the aim of the present study was to determine density and maturation stage (i.e. DM concentration) of corn silages under farm conditions in Brazil, establishing relationships between density and physical and chemical characteristics. In a completely randomized design, 20 bunkers of corn silage, each from a different farm, were used for data collection. Using a coring machine, 5 samples of silage were extracted from an exposed face of each silo and samples were analyzed for density of compaction, plus concentrations of DM, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), total digestible nutrients (TDN), total carbohydrate (TC), non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) and starch (STA), as well as electrical conductivity. There was significant variation in many of the parameters measured with the greatest variation in density on a natural matter basis. Negative correlations were observed between percentages of DM, NDF and ADF in the silage and silage density on a natural matter basis (P<0.05). On the other hand, DM% was positively correlated with concentrations of STA, TDN and TC (P<0.05). Density on a DM basis showed positive correlation with STA but was negatively correlated with NDF and ADF (P<0.05) indicating that the more fibrous material is harder to compact. A technology transfer program seems warranted to inform Brazilian farmers of these findings and the importance of harvesting forage at a stage of growth when quality would be better to increase the probability of achieving adequate compaction of the ensiled material and hence better quality of material at feeding out.

AB  - Background Timing of breeding season of temperate passerines has been considered to be adjusted to their food availability. There is little work to reveal the cell stress responses of the nestlings hatched asynchronized with the food abundance peak, which is important for understanding the physiological link between the timing of breeding and the fitness of offspring. Methods Using gene expression level of blood HSP70 and HSP90 as indicators, we compared the cell stress response of Asian Short-toed Lark (Calandrella cheleensis) nestlings hatched under conditions of low, mid or high food (grasshopper nymph) availability in 2017. Results Nymph biomass, sample time and interaction of these two factors significantly influenced the blood gene expression level of HSP70 and HSP90 of Asian Short-toed Lark nestlings. HSP70 and HSP90 gene expression levels of the nestlings at 14:00 were significantly higher than those at 5:00. At either 5:00 or 14:00, the gene expression levels of HSP70 and HSP90 increase with the decrease of nymph biomass. Conclusions These results indicate that food availability is an important environment factor inducing cellular stress of Asian Short-toed Lark nestlings. The interactive effect of the nymph abundance and sample time on the HSPs response may be related with the daily temperature variation of the grassland. Over cell stress response may be one of physiological factor mediating the effect of food availability and the nestling's fitness.

AB  - This study evaluated the concentration and distribution of heavy metals (HM) (Cr, Ni, Pb, Cd, Hg, and Zn) and pesticides (organochlorine and organophosphorus) and the relationship of these pollutants with the physico-chemical properties of agricultural soils in an Irrigation District (ID) in Colombia. Soils samples were analyzed for pH, humidity, organic matter, P total, N total, electric conductivity (EC), cation exchange capacity, and texture (% sand, clay and silt). Canonical correlation was used to determined relationship between soil properties and HM. Soil pollution were evaluated with geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (Cdeg) and pollution load index (PLI). The results indicated that, in general, the soils had adequate physicochemical conditions for the establishment and development of crops. The presence of pesticides in the soils was not reported. However, concentrations HM was detected (Zn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Hg > Cd). The soil characteristics (silt, clay, pH and EC) contributed to explain HM concentrations. The Igeo indicated that the soils are heavily contaminated with Hg (3 < Igeo <4). The CF was very high for Hg (>6). The Cdeg presented moderate to considerable variations (>6Cdeg<24). The PLI indicated that the soils are contaminated (1.308). The presence of HM may be associated with the agricultural and quarries activities carried out near the ID. The impact caused by high concentrations of HM can lead environmental, economic and social impacts in the study zone.

AB  - Background Neighbourhood greenness or vegetative presence has been associated with indicators of health and well-being, but its relationship to depression in older adults has been less studied. Understanding the role of environmental factors in depression may inform and complement traditional depression interventions, including both prevention and treatment. Aims This study examines the relationship between neighbourhood greenness and depression diagnoses among older adults in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Method Analyses examined 249 405 beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare, a USA federal health insurance programme for older adults. Participants were 65 years and older, living in the same Miami location across 2 years (2010-2011). Multilevel analyses assessed the relationship between neighbourhood greenness, assessed by average block-level normalised difference vegetative index via satellite imagery, and depression diagnosis using USA Medicare claims data. Covariates were individual age, gender, race/ethnicity, number of comorbid health conditions and neighbourhood median household income. Results Over 9% of beneficiaries had a depression diagnosis. Higher levels of greenness were associated with lower odds of depression, even after adjusting for demographics and health comorbidities. When compared with individuals residing in the lowest tertile of greenness, individuals from the middle tertile (medium greenness) had 8% lower odds of depression (odds ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.88, 0.96; P = 0.0004) and those from the high tertile (high greenness) had 16% lower odds of depression (odds ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.79, 0.88; P < 0.0001). Conclusions Higher levels of greenness may reduce depression odds among older adults. Increasing greenery - even to moderate levels - may enhance individual-level approaches to promoting wellness. Declaration of interest None.

AB  - The present study unravels the microalgal diversity and dynamics of a tropical estuarine ecosystem (Muttukadu, of Indian south east coast) and applies tools like isolation of useful species to utilize in aquaculture as well as to conserve the native strains. The study was carried out for a period of 18months. Selected diversity indices (Simpson index, Dominance index, Shannon- Weiner index, Pielou's evenness index and Margalef richness index) were used to describe the trends of diversity in the estuary during the study period. Spatial and temporal changes in microalgal diversity in the estuary were analysed. Sixty three species of microalgae belonging to Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Dinophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Prasinophyceae and Zygnematophyceae were identified. Out of these, members of Bacillariophyceae formed the dominant flora (48.5%) with twenty six species, followed by Cyanophyceae (29.2%) and Chlorophyceae (13.6%). The species diversity was increased after the flood during December-2015 in south east coast of India. More than two dozens of microalgal strains useful for larval nutrition in aquaculture were isolated during the study period. Nutrient profiling of isolates revealed the presence of essential fatty acids (EPA & DHA) in high percentage in some of the isolates. Altogether, the present study is the first report of this kind from Muttukadu which gives the insight on a) the seasonal changes in abundance of microalgae species in a tropical estuary and b) suitable time for the isolation of potential species for aquaculture and conservation of various species in the laboratory conditions.

AB  - Confidence factors play an important role not only in the assessment of business cycles but also in the evaluation of national competitiveness (e.g. the Global Competitiveness report published by the World Economic Forum) due to both using soft data obtained from opinion surveys. The subjective nature of confidence leads to questions about the soundness of such findings. Since the answers from opinion surveys are subjective, the empirical relationship between sentiment indicators and economic variables is not unambiguously established. In these conditions, the results of business surveys and the findings published by competitiveness rankings should not be accepted unconditionally. This paper starts with the comparison of soft data (respondents' sentiment) assessing the quality of institutions among world regions in the Global Competitiveness Report 2017-18. The aim of this paper is to offer a more precise view of the development of economic sentiment in the EU countries, especially in Germany and the Visegrad group countries (the V4). As tools for this description, a business sentiment indicator (ESI) and confidence indicators were applied. For analysis of changes in business sentiment and respondents' confidence, a graphical examination of variables, correlation analysis, changes in standard deviation, changes in countries' ranking, and the comparison of average sentiment (confidence) in the pre-crisis and the post-crisis period were used. Our analysis indicates the equivalent of the so-called halo effect in the pre-crisis period for the V4 (the positive expectation connected with the EU accession) and the deterioration in sentiment and confidence indicators in the post-crisis period.

AB  - This study determines the suitability of using blood plasma and dermal scute samples as a non-destructive technique for monitoring the health of Morelet's crocodiles and the presence of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the environment. We collected samples (blood plasma and caudal scutes) from 30 Morelet's crocodiles (C. moreletii); 16 were wild, and 14 were captive. The 30 samples were analyzed for 24 different OCPs and compared in 10 groups based on chemical affinities (isomers and degradation products). Endrin and Chlordane were the most frequent OCP groups detected, found in 63% and 57% of the samples, respectively. We did not find significant differences in OCP concentrations in tissues (plasma and scutes) between wild and captive crocodiles; there were also no significant correlations among concentrations in tissues.
   Blood plasma and scutes are good indicators of OCP body burdens in Morelet's crocodiles for monitoring the presence and fluctuation of toxicity in the environment; however, it is not possible to infer the concentrations in one tissue from the concentrations detected in the other tissue.
   Selecting which tissues to use for OCP analyses depends on the specific objectives of the researcher. For research, on individual health and local exposure to contaminants, plasma is suitable. For evaluating the presence over time of OCPs in the environment, the caudal dermal scutes are the most appropriate tissue. Overall, it is important to take into account the body condition to avoid biases due to bioamplification effects.

AB  - As the frequency of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) become more common in recreational lakes and water supply reservoirs, demand for rapid detection and temporal monitoring will be imminent for effective management. The goal of this study was to demonstrate a novel and potentially operational cross satellite based protocol for synoptic monitoring of rapidly evolving and increasingly common CyanoHABs in inland waters. The analysis involved a novel way to cross-calibrate a chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) detection model for the Landsat-8 OLI sensor from the relationship between the normalized difference chlorophyll index and the floating algal index derived from Sentinel-2A on a coinciding overpass date during the summer CyanoHAB bloom in Utah Lake. This aided in the construction of a time-series phenology of the Utah Lake CyanoHAB event. Spatio-temporal cyanobacterial density maps from both Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 sensors revealed that the bloom started in the first week of July 2016 (July 3rd, mean cell count: 9163 cells/ma reached peak in mid July (July 15th, mean cell count: 108176 cells/ma and reduced in August (August 24th, mean cell count: 9145 cells/Ina Analysis of physical and meteorological factors suggested a complex interaction between landscape processes (high surface runoff), climatic conditions (high temperature, high rainfall followed by negligible rainfall, stable wind), and water quality (low water level, high Chl-a) which created a supportive environment for triggering these blooms in Utah Lake. This cross satellite based monitoring methods can be a great tool for regular monitoring and will reduce the budget cost for monitoring and predicting CyanoHABs in large lakes.

AB  - Road agencies are facing the challenges of aging pavements, deteriorating networks, and insufficient maintenance budgets. This study addresses two limitations in the current state of practice in pavement management. First, because the evaluation of maintenance strategies has traditionally focused on economic and technical aspects, it neglects the environmental impact of maintenance decisions. Second, current management systems often provide a unique, optimised pavement maintenance strategy based on a specific objective(s) and constraint(s). The main objective of the study is to analyse the effect of including environmental aspects and funding availability in the design of maintenance strategies. To achieve this objective, the study followed a three-step methodology. First, this study reviews existing practices on pavement maintenance and the criteria considered to trigger the application of maintenance treatments and their effects on pavement condition. Then, maintenance strategies are optimised considering three levels of budgetary capacity and a sustainable evaluation which incorporates technical, economic, and environmental aspects over the pavement lifecycle. Finally, a case study dealing with an urban pavement network in Chile is analysed. Results obtained from this case study show that an increment of 2% in maintenance budget allows to account for more sustainable maintenance decisions, such as cold in-place recycling and full-depth slab repair, whose greenhouse gas emissions are lower than other alternatives. Results also show that functional asphalt overlay and microsurfacing are more recommended in flexible pavements when budgetary restrictions are low, whereas recommended treatments for rigid pavements exhibit small variability with budgetary restrictions.

AB  - The temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration is crucial for modeling carbon dynamics but it is variable. Presently, however, most models employ a fixed value of 1.5 or 2.0 for the increase of soil respiration per 10 degrees C increase in temperature (Q10). Here we identified the variability of Q10 at a regional scale (Rur catchment, Germany/Belgium/Netherlands). We divided the study catchment into environmental soil classes (ESCs), which we define as unique combinations of land use, aggregated soil groups, and texture. We took nine soil samples from each ESC (108 samples) and incubated them at four soil moisture levels and five temperatures (5-25 degrees C). We hypothesized that Q10 variability is controlled by soil organic carbon (SOC) degradability and soil moisture and that ESC can be used as a widely available proxy for Q10, owing to differences in SOC degradability. Measured Q10 values ranged from 1.2 to 2.8 and were correlated with indicators of SOC degradability (e.g., pH, r = -0.52). The effect of soil moisture on Q10 was variable: Q10 increased with moisture in croplands but decreased in forests. The ESC captured significant parts of Q10 variability under dry (R-2 = 0.44) and intermediate (R-2 = 0.36) moisture conditions, where Q10 increased in the order cropland<grassland<forest. Overall, the estimated heterotrophic CO2 release from the catchment was up to 45% lower when ESC-and moisture-specific Q10 values were used instead of 1.5, suggesting that scaling Q10 on the basis of both ESC and moisture might be a promising concept for spatially continuous assessments of carbon turnover at regional scales.

AB  - Various kinds of human disturbances on cropland are the main reasons for soil erosion and land degradation. Farming practices in mountainous areas vary greatly among cropland plots because of the heterogeneity of biophysical conditions and differences in farmers' management behavior. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a composite index of cropland physical disturbance intensity (CLDI) to reflect the plot-scale discrepancy of potential soil erosion in mountainous areas. The study was based on both plot survey and household interview data, collected from six typical catchments in mountainous areas of southwestern China. Four kinds of physical disturbance practices and two kinds of conservation practices during one crop rotation period were synthesized to develop the CLDI index. The rough set theory was referenced to avoid subjectivity during weight allocation. The results show that conventional tillage, deep fertilization, and manual weeding are the main causes of cropland soil erosion, whereas manure application in combination with seasonal fallow reduces soil erosion. Different crop types as well as cropland location factors determine the spatial pattern of CLDI. Crop rotation modes with major crops of tobacco and maize resulted in a maximal CLDI, and cropland plots with a distance radius of 150 meters away from households received the most intensive physical disturbance. These results are critical to help better protect rural environments in mountainous areas. Based on the results, methods to reduce cropland soil erosion are suggested.

AB  - Oxytocin is often portrayed as a hormone specific to social behavior, reflective of positive welfare states, and linked to mental states. Research on oxytocin in domesticated animal species has been few to date but is rapidly increasing (in dog, pig, cattle, sheep), with direct implications for animal welfare. This review evaluates the evidence for the specificity of oxytocin as an indicator of: 1. Social, 2. Positive, and 3. Psychological well-being. Oxytocin has most often been studied in socially relevant paradigms, with a lack of non-social control paradigms. Oxytocin research appears biased toward investigating positive valence, with a lack of control in valence or arousal. Oxytocin actions are modulated by the environmental and social contexts, which are important factors to consider. Limited evidence supports that oxytocin's actions are linked to psychological states; nevertheless whether this is a direct effect of oxytocin per se remains to be demonstrated. Overall, it is premature to judge oxytocin's potential as an animal welfare indicator given the few and discrepant findings and a lack of standardization in methodology. We cover potential causes for discrepancies and suggest solutions through appropriate methodological design, oxytocin sampling or delivery, analysis and reporting. Of particular interest, the oxytocinergic system as a whole remains poorly understood. Appreciation for the differences that social contact and group living pose in domesticated species and the way they interact with humans should be key considerations in using oxytocin as a psychosocial indicator of well-being.

AB  - Paulownia, one of the fastest growing broad-leaved tree species in the world, is widely distributed in the warm temperate regions of China. However, there are few commercial-scale Paulownia plantations, and there is only limited information available about the most suitable soil quality for Paulownia fortunei growth in mid-subtropical, Hunan Province, China.
   To understand the effect of the growth of P. fortunei on soil conditions, 25 soil property parameters under Paulownia plantations were studied in Hunan Province, China. Seventy-two standard plots of eight different stand types were analyzed by three statistical approaches to assess soil quality (SQ) in the different P. fortunei plantations.
   The results revealed that a majority of the soil characteristics when intercropping with oilseed rape and the pure P. fortunei (plantation III) were better than intercropping with Camellia oleifera, orange trees, and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.). Available calcium, available magnesium, available potassium, available phosphorus, soil thickness, slope, soil organic matter, available sulfur, available copper, dehydrogenase, and available zinc were selected as the minimum data set (MDS). The SQ index (SQI) showed that three classes for soil quality among the eight P. fortunei plantations ranged from 0.48 to 0.88 and these were correlated with standing volume (p < 0.05).
   From the results, we concluded that selected MDS indicators can describe the soil fertility quality of P. fortunei plantations, and that the relationship between SQI and standing volume has a biological significance. P. fortunei plantations intercropped with Camellia oleifera, orange trees, and Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) caused a deterioration in SQ, but intercropping oilseed rape and pure P. fortunei plantations produced an improvement in SQ.

AB  - Accurate pH measurements in polar waters and sea ice brines require pH indicator dyes characterized at near-zero and below-zero temperatures and high salinities. We present experimentally determined physical and chemical characteristics of purified meta-Cresol Purple (mCP) pH indicator dye suitable for pH measurements in seawater and conservative seawater-derived brines at salinities (S) between 35 and 100 and temperatures (T) between their freezing point and 298.15 K (25 degrees C). Within this temperature and salinity range, using purified mCP and a novel thermostated spectrophotometric device, the pH on the total scale (pH(T)) can be calculated from direct measurements of the absorbance ratio R of the dye in natural samples as
   pH(T) = -log(k(2)(T)e(2)) + log(R - e(1)/1 - R-e3/(e2))
   Based on the mCP characterization in these extended conditions, the temperature and salinity dependence of the molar absorptivity ratios and - log( k(2)(T)e(2)) of purified mCP is described by the following functions: e(1) = -0.004363 + 3.598 x 10(-5)T, e(3)/e(2) = -0.016224 + 2.42851 x 10(-4)T + 5.05663 x 10(-5)(S-35), and -log( k(2)(T)e(2)) = - 319.8369 + 0.688159 S -0.00018374 S-2 + ( 10508.724 - 32.9599 S + 0.059082S(2)) T-1 + ( 55.54253 - 0.101639 S) ln T -0.08112151T. This work takes the characterisation of mCP beyond the currently available ranges of 278.15 K <= T <= 308.15 K and 20 <= S <= 40 in natural seawater, thereby allowing high quality pHT measurements in polar systems.

AB  - China has experienced rapid urbanization in recent decades along with dramatic economic growth. Previous studies have shown that urbanization has both positive and negative effects on health. However, there is a lack of research on the overall effects of urbanization on the epidemic transition of environmental health risks considering various pathways in China. In the present study, we studied the contributions of different aspects of urbanization in China to epidemic transitions using provincial and multi-year (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) panel data. Statistical models with fixed and random effects were developed to explore the impacts of different urbanization indicators on the overall epidemic transition of environmental health (general model) and the changes in cause-specific mortality rates of typical diseases (cause-specific models). The results show that the impacts of non-communicable diseases continue to grow during the urbanization process in China. The ratio of communicable disease-related mortality to non-communicable disease-related mortality continues to decrease over time. The general model shows that the improved medical conditions (coefficient = -0.0011, P = 0.037), the improved urban infrastructure (e.g., tap water supply) (coefficient = -0.00065, P < 0.001), and the rise in income (coefficient = -0.00027, P = 0.047) during the urbanization process are important factors that promote this overall epidemic transition. The cause-specific models show that the mechanisms behind the general model are complicated. More attention should be paid to non-communicable diseases in urban health management. Specific health policies for different diseases should incorporate the considerations of different impact pathways of urbanization. (C) 2016 Science China Press.

AB  - European forestry is facing many challenges, including the need to adapt to climate change and an unprecedented increase in forest damage. We investigated these challenges in a Norway spruce-dominated mountain region in Central Europe. We used the model Sibyla to explore forest biomass production to the year 2100 under climate change and under two alternative management systems: the currently applied management (CM), which strives to actively improve the forest's adaptive capacity, and no management (NM) as a reference. Because biodiversity is thought to have mostly positive effects on the adaptive capacity of forests and on the quality of ecosystem services, we explored how climate change and management affect indicators of biodiversity. We found a differential response across the elevation-climatic gradient, including a drought-induced decrease in biomass production over large areas. With CM, the support of non-spruce species and the projected improvement of their growth increased tree species diversity. The promotion of species with higher survival rates led to a decrease in forest damage relative to both the present conditions and NM. NM preserved the high density of over-matured spruce trees, which caused forest damage to increase. An abundance of dead wood and large standing trees, which can increase biodiversity, increased with NM. Our results suggest that commercial spruce forests, which are not actively adapted to climate change, tend to preserve their monospecific composition at a cost of increased forest damage. The persisting high rates of damage along with the adverse effects of climate change make the prospects of such forests uncertain.

AB  - This article presents the results of a case study conducted on Cachoeira das Emas beach, at Mogi-Guacu River, in Pirassununga (SP). Using precipitation levels as explanatory variables, simple statistical models based on linear regression were developed. Positive correlation between the concentration of faecal indicators in water and accumulated rainfall in 24, 48 and 72 hours, prior to sampling on the river, were observed. Data sets used for calibration (2009-2011 period) and validation (period of 2012) of the predictive tools were originally acquired from distinct monitoring networks: rainfall levels data by the Departamento de Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DAEE) and recreational water quality data by the Companhia Ambiental do Estado de Sao Paulo (CETESB). Due to different goals of these monitoring networks, not every rainfall event during the study period was related to a concentration value of fecal indicator in the water, and vice versa, so the regressions obtained were based on a low quantity of observations. The results indicate that there is a potential for applying the predictive tool, but it requires monitoring the model parameters in conjunct, in order to obtain the amount of data necessary to calibration and validation. Ideally, the use of this recreational water management tool would be during a certain period of the year, when there are more people at the beach site, on locations where the main source of pollution is diffuse, resulting from runoff drainage. It would also be possible to add other environmental variables to the models, such as flow and turbidity, provided that they are monitored with water quality conditions.

AB  - The low cost and efficient CaO catalysts have been successfully prepared from chicken manure, by a simple calcination, in this present work. Chicken manure contains significant content of calcium compounds that can easily be converted into the active calcium oxide catalyst after calcination at 850 degrees C under air. The Hammett indicator test showed that the obtained CaO catalyst has the basic strength in a range of 15 < H_ < 18.4, revealing that the basicity of the obtained catalyst is mainly ascribed to the strong basic properties of metal-O groups. The obtained CaO catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity for biodiesel production from transesterification of waste cooking oil and methanol. Up to 90% FAME yield was obtained at optimum reaction condition (i.e. 7.5 wt% of catalyst, 15:1 of methanol:oil molar ratio and 65 degrees C). The experimental kinetic data fitted well with the pseudo-first order model and the activation energy was found to be 78.8 kJ mol(-1). Moreover, fuel properties of the produced biodiesel were determined according to the European standard and found to be within the specifications. The uses of chicken manure as a catalyst source and waste cooking oil as a raw material for biodiesel production not only offers the environmentally friendly and cost-effective way to recycle those wastes, but also help to lower the biodiesel production cost to make biodiesel competitive with petroleum-based diesel.

AB  - Developing methods of measuring multidimensional poverty and improving the accuracy of poverty identification have been hot topics in international poverty research for decades. They are also key issues for improving the quality and effectiveness of rural poverty reduction programs in China. So far, selection and integration of poverty indicators remains the main difficult for measurement of multidimensional poverty. Guided by the sustainable livelihoods framework developed in the UK by the Department for International Development (DFID), an index system and an integration method for geographical identification of multidimensional poverty were established, and they were further used to carry out a county-level identification of poverty in rural China. Additionally, comparisons were made of the identification results with counties having single-dimension income poverty in rural areas and poor counties designated by the Chinese central government. The results showed that a total of 655 counties, with 141 million rural residents, were identified as multidimensionally poor. They are concentrated and conjointly distributed geographically, and evil natural conditions are their common features. In comparison to the income poor and the designated poor counties, the multidimensionally poor counties were not only worse in single-dimensional and composite scores, but also having multiple disadvantages and deprivations. By identifying the disadvantage and deprived dimensions, the measurement of multidimensional poverty should be very helpful for each county to work out and implement antipoverty programs accordingly, and it would make contribution to improve the sustainability of poverty reduction. Hopefully, this research may also shed light on multidimensional poverty measurement for other developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecology and genetics can influence the fate of individuals and populations in multiple ways. However, to date, few studies consider them when modelling the evolutionary trajectory of populations faced with admixture with non-local populations. For the Atlantic salmon, a model incorporating these elements is urgently needed because many populations are challenged with gene-flow from non-local and domesticated conspecifics. We developed an Individual-Based Salmon Eco-genetic Model (IBSEM) to simulate the demographic and population genetic change of an Atlantic salmon population through its entire life-cycle. Processes such as growth, mortality, and maturation are simulated through stochastic procedures, which take into account environmental variables as well as the genotype of the individuals. IBSEM is based upon detailed empirical data from salmon biology, and parameterized to reproduce the environmental conditions and the characteristics of a wild population inhabiting a Norwegian river. Simulations demonstrated that the model consistently and reliably reproduces the characteristics of the population. Moreover, in absence of farmed escapees, the modelled populations reach an evolutionary equilibrium that is similar to our definition of a 'wild' genotype. We assessed the sensitivity of the model in the face of assumptions made on the fitness differences between farm and wild salmon, and evaluated the role of straying as a buffering mechanism against the intrusion of farm genes into wild populations. These results demonstrate that IBSEM is able to capture the evolutionary forces shaping the life history of wild salmon and is therefore able to model the response of populations under environmental and genetic stressors.

AB  - An investigation of palaeofloral distribution with depositional environment and palaeoclimatic condition of western Indian subcontinent during Early Eocene period has been carried out from a lignite-bearing succession of Cambay Basin, western India. The study of biomarkers, palynological remains and petrography is taken as proxies for providing supportive evidence for our inference. The petrographic results reveal that the sediments are thermally immature and coalification was extended up to the lignitic stage (low rank B). The palynological results show the dominance of angiosperms, mainly members belonging to the Arecaceae family, throughout the studied section. Triterpenoids with oleanane, ursane and lupane structure in extractable organic matter are derived from angiosperm wax. Pollen grains (Spinizonocolpites, Proxapertites, Dipterocarpuspollenites, Albertipollenites, Retipollenites, Arengapollenites, Lakiapollis and Longapertites) with pteridophyte spores and fungal fruiting bodies confirm the prevalence of tropical to subtropical climate during the deposition of the sediments. Sesquiterpenoids like longifolene-12, methanoazulene, cadinane and 8-selinene together with amyrin derivatives are the indicator of Dipterocarpaceae family that grows in the extant tropical rain forests in SE Asia. Appearance of dinoflagellate cysts and the predominance of lower molecular weight part in n-alkane series with the signature of submerged/floating vegetation in the shale horizon indicate marine influence in the younger part of the mine section. The presence of mangrove pollen such as Spinizonocolpites, Proxapertites and Acanthotricolpites further suggests that the lignite-bearing sequence was deposited in marshy marginal marine environment.

AB  - Autoclaving diminishes the nutritional value of rat diets, depending on the duration and temperature of the process and the type of dietary protein. We evaluated in vivo and in vitro the effects of autoclaving on the protein and energy values of soy-free and soy-containing rat diets. The true digestibility and biological value of the dietary protein were determined in a 10-d experiment involving 28-d-old Wistar Crl:WI(Han) male rats fed casein- or soy-containing diet that was autoclaved for 20 min at 121 degrees C (T1), 10 min at 134 degrees C (T2), or not autoclaved (T0). The apparent protein digestibility and metabolizable energy concentration of experimental diets were assayed during an 18-d trial involving 6-wk-old Wistar-Crl:WI(Han) male rats and compared with a commercial diet. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content, amount of protein bound to NDF, protein solubility, and in vitro ileal protein digestibility were determined. Autoclaving decreased protein solubility, with the T2 condition having a greater effect than that of T1, and decreased the protein parameters determined in vivo, except for the apparent digestibility of the standard rat diet. Autoclaving decreased metabolizable energy slightly. The Atwater formula yielded higher values than those determined in rats, in vitro, and calculated according to the pig equation. We conclude that autoclaving diets according to the T1 program was less detrimental to dietary protein than was T2 and that the NDF content and protein solubility may be helpful in assessing the effect of autoclaving. The pig formula and in vitro method appear to be valid for estimating the metabolizable energy of rat diets.

AB  - Weissella hellenica BCC 7239, isolated from Thai fermented pork sausage called Nham, produced two putatively novel bacteriocins, 7293A and 7293B. Both bacteriocins had broad antimicrobial spectra and exceptionally inhibited several important Gram-negative food-borne pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli). The highest amount of bacteriocin was produced in MRS and APT media at 30 degrees C without agitation. Bacteriocin 7293A showed relatively higher antimicrobial activity than bacteriocin 7293B. However, pH and thermal stability of bacteriocin 7293A was lower. These bacteriocins were of proteinaceous nature, in which the complete inactivation of their antimicrobial activity after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, including trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, pepsin and protease K was observed, whilst lipase and alpha-amylase exhibited no effect. Antimicrobial activity of both peptides was also not inactivated by organic solvents (ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, acetonitrile) and surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 80 and Triton X-100). Bacteriocin 7293A and B exhibited bactericidal effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative indicators without cell-lysis. According to ESI/MS analysis, the molecular masses of bacteriocin 7293A and B were determined to be 6249.302 and 6489.716 Da, respectively. Because their molecular masses were not similar to those of other known bacteriocins, both bacteriocin 7293A and B could be novel bacteriocins. Thus, both novel bacteriocins hold promise for applications in the prevention or treatment of pathogenic infections as food and feed additives to replace antibiotics for enhancing the productivity and sustainability of food animals.

AB  - The transfer of chemical elements/compounds within the soil-plant chain is a part of the biochemical cycling, and this system is controlled by biotic and abiotic factors which determine the final mobility and availability of chemical variables. Heavy metal contamination and low pH are stress factors that lead to changes in the contents of important foliage compounds, which can be used as non-specific indicators of plant stress. In this study, Norway spruce forests in the Sokolov region, being a part of the "Black Triangle," were selected to assess geochemical and biochemical interactions in the natural soil/plant system. The authors studied the relationship between soil and spruce needle contents of macronutrients and potentially toxic elements and tested whether the soil parameters and their vertical distribution within a soil profile (two organic and two mineral horizons) affect foliage biochemical parameters (contents of photosynthetic pigments, phenolic compounds and lignin). Factor analysis was used to identify underlying variables that explained the pattern of correlations within and between the biochemical and geochemical datasets. Aluminum (Al) and arsenic (As) were identified as toxic elements with high bio-availability for spruce trees, and both were taken up by trees and translocated to the foliage. The correlations between two toxic element contents in needles (Al and As) and the contents of soluble phenolic compounds and total carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio suggest that these latter two biochemical parameters, which both proved to be sensitive to the soil geochemical conditions, can serve as suitable non-specific stress markers.

AB  - Uncertainties associated with pesticide exposure forecasts arise from many sources such as spatial and temporal variability of factors influencing pesticide behavior, inaccuracies in the measurement or estimation of input parameters and deficiencies in model structure. It is well acknowledged that, at least to some extent, simulation uncertainties should be accounted for when technical and political strategies are developed to mitigate pesticide exposure. We monitored the fate of the insecticide imidacloprid in a paddy rice field in Chieng Khoi watershed, Northern Vietnam. Pesticide fate was modeled using a new dynamic model together with the General Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach. A 95 % prediction uncertainty (PU) band was computed accounting for uncertainties in pesticide parameters, management practices, and weather conditions. As assessment criterion we used the Nash and Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (NSE). Measured paddy water concentrations of imidacloprid reached up to 53 mu g L-1, paddy soil concentrations up to 9 mu g kg(-1). Calculated PU bands were in good agreement with field measurements. The field-scale model was extended to simulate pesticide fate in connected paddies. Imidacloprid concentrations in the afflux of the stream were estimated to be up to 83 mu g L-1 under the current management practice in the research area. The loss of imidacloprid to the stream was assessed to range between 21 and 68 % of applied mass. Future studies, however, should focus on assessing loads of pesticides further widely used in connected paddies to help decision makers and farmers to adjust management strategies of protecting the environment.

AB  - Coastal estuaries receiving low and fluctuating freshwater flows are creating more variable salinity environments for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), including seagrasses. Some SAV species, such as Ruppia maritima L. (wigeongrass), are adapted to variable salinity, but rapid salinity changes can limit population persistence. For example, R. maritima historically dominated at the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone under greater freshwater flows, but has a more limited distribution in recent decades with greater salinity variability. While R. maritima is an indicator species for Everglades restoration, little is known about how ecotone salinity patterns drive its current limited distribution in southern Everglades estuaries. Seed production is important for population maintenance in this disturbance-tolerant species. Thus, we examined R. maritima life history transitions, including seed germination, seedling and adult survival, and sexual reproduction under site-specific salinity variability across the Everglades ecotone. Seedlings were most susceptible to fluctuating salinity with only 13 % survival at the lower more marine ecotone site under conditions of relatively large-amplitude fluctuations. Adult survival also decreased from upper (93 %) to lower (25 %) sites, resulting in a significant decline in per capita clonal reproduction rates. The markedly low survival rate at the lower ecotone was associated with rapid salinity fluctuations (2.5-20 psu) with short periodicities (<24 h). In addition, no sexual reproduction occurred at any of our ecotone sites, indicating that seed production may be limiting. Thus, hydrologic restoration targets should consider optimization of salinity levels and dynamics that promote SAV early life stage survival and sexual reproduction to restore critical coastal habitats in the Everglades and other highly dynamic estuarine systems.

AB  - Plant communities respond sensitively to urban expansion and therefore serve as indicators for human land use. An urban-rural gradient approach was used to examine changes in plant species composition and abundance related to human-altered habitats in the Western Siberian city of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan). This region is characterized by harsh continental environmental conditions and recent anthropogenic degradation of the original steppe grasslands as a result of enforced land-use changes (Virgin Land Campaign) and rapidly expanding urbanization. Plant diversity and abundance as well as the percentage of alien species were recorded in plots on four 20-km long transect lines running from the city centre to the rural surroundings. Various habitat and landscape characteristics were assessed along the transect lines to describe the urban-rural gradient. Based on the results of a principal component analysis considering these landscape characteristics the variable "distance to the city centre" was used as proxy for the urban-rural gradient. Plant diversity increased with increasing distance to the city centre and was also influenced by the type of land use (ornamentally managed, agricultural or unmanaged land) and the percentage cover of built-up area within a 500 m radius. The percentage of alien species decreased from 45% in the city centre to 23% in the rural surroundings. The percentage of species belonging to different plant life forms and to different evolutionary strategies were affected by different landscape characteristics. The study showed that the combined effects of expanding urbanization and agricultural land-use changes altered the plant species composition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Subcutaneous (SC) injection is currently the most common route of self-administering biopharmaceuticals such as proteins and peptides. While pharmaceutical scientists have acquired great skill in identifying formulations for these proteins and peptides with multi-year shelf life stability, the SC injection of these formulations can result in inconsistent or particularly low bioavailability outcomes. We hypothesise that upon injection, the chemical, physical and physiological properties of the subcutaneous tissue may play a crucial role in determining the therapeutic outcomes of SC injected biopharmaceuticals. We contend that physical and chemical stresses placed upon the injected protein or peptide as it transitions from the non-physiological environment of its formulation to the homeostatic conditions of the SC tissue can affect its fate following injection, and that by taking this environment into account when formulating, more precisely controlled release of SC injected biopharmaceuticals could be achieved. In this mini-reviewwe describe how events that occur to an injected protein or peptide during this post-injection transition period could affect the diffusion of bioactive material to blood capillaries and lymphatic vessels. With this in mind, we have reviewed the chemical, physical and physiological attributes of the SC tissue and collated studies on how these properties are known to affect protein stability and diffusional properties. Finally, examples where the understanding of the properties of the SC tissue when formulating for SC injected biopharmaceuticals has improved the predictability of drug delivery via the SC route are discussed, with the need for novel tools for rational and informed formulation development highlighted.

AB  - Major element, K/Ar, sedimentation and palynology data are reported on Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks from the Yayu and Delbi-Moye Basins, SW Ethiopia. In the Yayu and Delbi-Moye Basins, pre-rift volcanic (basalts) and post-rift volcanic (basalts) are separated by coal and oil shale-bearing sedimentary rocks. The basalts are tholeiitic in composition. The K/Ar data on the volcanic rocks range from 10.98 +/- 0.55 Ma (Lower Miocene i.e. Tortonian) to 111.19 +/- 2.83 Ma (Early Cretaceous i.e. Aptian). Inter-Trappean coal and oil shale-bearing sedimentary rocks are widely distributed in the Yayu and Delbi-Moye Basins. The NNW-SSE fault system developed grabens and half-grabens for the deposition of coal and oil shale-bearing sedimentary rocks. The sedimentary successions are dominated by fine to medium-grained sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, carbonaceous shales, carbonaceous claystones, coal and oil shale seams, and are characterized by meandering river and lacustrine depositional environments. Fresh water algae Botryococcus brauni, Pediastrum sp., Polypodii sporites favus and Polypodii sporites afavus and Pachydermites diederixi, are common palynomorphs in the studied coal and oil shales, and are indicators of lacustrine environment. The presence of Peregrinipollis nigericus is consistent with Oligocene to Miocene. The presence of Euphorbiaceae, Papilionacae, Melastomtaceae sp., Dodonaea, Martretia quadricornis, Rubiaceae sp. (pollen derived from tropical shrubs), Sapotaceae spp. and Meliaceae spp. are indicative of humid, tropical rainforest conditions. Extensive bio-assemblages confirm that the age of coal and oil shale-bearing sedimentary rocks to be Oligocene to Miocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The eel is a catadromous fish which spends most of its life in freshwater and adults swim to the Sargasso Sea region to spawn. While preparing for the reproductive process, eels undergo a metamorphosis to become what is called silver eel; a process involving changes in the colour and weight of the body and an increase in the eye size. These are indicators of fish maturity and they facilitate the selection of fish for reproduction under controlled conditions. During this study, changes in the body weight (BW) and eye size in female European eel were observed while being given weekly hormonal injections of 20 mg kg(-1) carp pituitary, homogenate and kept in 15 degrees C freshwater and in 15 degrees C saltwater with a salinity of 32-33 parts per thousand. Fish kept in saltwater but not subjected to hormonal stimulation were used as a control group. Furthermore, after the experiment was finished, females in the control group were kept for next 5 months, with the same environmental parameters maintained. Differences between the treated groups were observed as early as week 4 of the experiment. An increase in fish BW was observed in fish kept both in salt and freshwater which were subjected to hormonal stimulation. On the other hand, changes in eye size were observed in the fish kept in saltwater, both in those hormonally stimulated and otherwise. The eye diameter in the fish kept in fresh after hormonal stimulation did not change significantly.

AB  - Eighteen semianthracite samples of the No. 9 coal seam in the Gequan Mine, Xingtai Coalfield, China were investigated, primarily by microscope and organic geochemical methods. The petrological results showed that the vitrinite random reflectance (R-o) is 2.36% and the maceral group was dominated by vitrinite. The gas chromatograms (GC) of the saturates display a monomodal or bimodal outline of n-alkane peaks, generally from n-C-10 to n-C-31, resulting in two ranges of Sigma (C-1-C-21) / Sigma (C-22-C-34) values. Most of the coal samples exhibit consistently similar parameters, such as pristane/n-C-17 and phytane/n-C-18 ratios, whereas samples with different Pr/Ph values may have been the result of varied redox depositional conditions. The distributions of the polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) identified in the aromatics were generally similar due to the similar high rank of the coal samples. Under the high thermal maturity, the PACs with greater thermodynamic stabilities (including 2-methylnaphthalene, 2,6- and 2,7-dimethylnaphthalenes, 2- and 3-methylphenanthrenes, and 2,6- and 2,7-dimethylphenanthrenes) were present at higher concentrations than those of less thermodynamically stable PACs. A portion of these PACs most likely originated from a secondary generation. The generally higher contents of dibenzothiophenes and benzonaphthothiophenes were most likely generated under the control of hydrothermal fluids. However, the coal-forming environment may also have played a role for higher contents of dibenzothiophenes and benzonaphthothiophenes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Questions How can conservation status of rich fen and alkaline spring areas be assessed most cost-effectively based on existing monitoring data? What is the precision and accuracy of available indicators? Location Rich fen and alkaline spring areas in Denmark. Methods Potential indicators of conservation status were evaluated based on: accuracy, measured as the ability to predict the number of typical species in monitoring plots; precision, measured as variation over years of indicators in repeated plots; and cost of obtaining data for the indicator. Indicators were derived using data from the Danish National Monitoring and Assessment Programme for the Aquatic and Terrestrial Environment from 2000 to 2009. Indicators included biotic indices derived from species lists, abiotic measurements of pH and nutrients and structural measurements of vegetation height and tree cover. Results The majority of indicators showed a significant correlation with the number of typical species. Floristic indicators, especially based on Ellenberg nutrient values, showed superior correlation and were furthermore very stable over years. Structural indicators were generally accurate, but were highly imprecise with high between-year variation. Among the abiotic indicators, pH and soil P were inaccurate, whereas tissue N content and nitrate in water were accurate but with low precision. When balancing efficiency of indicators with monitoring costs, laboratory analyses stand out as expensive compared to recording of a species list, the latter providing up to five valuable indicators. Conclusions Floristic indicators derived from Ellenberg values, and especially those related to nutrient availability, are cost-effective indicators of conservation status. The method is applicable to all regions where Ellenberg indicator values have been calibrated to fit local conditions.

AB  - Along elevational gradients, climate warming may lead to an upslope shift of the lower and upper range margin of organisms. A recent meta-analysis concluded that these shifts are species specific and considerably differ among taxonomic lineages. We used the opportunity to compare upper range margins of five lineages (plants, beetles, flies, hymenoptera, and birds) between 1902-1904 and 2006-2007 within one region (Bavarian Forest, Central Europe). Based on the increase in the regional mean annual temperature during this period and the regional lapse rate, the upslope shift is expected to be between 51 and 201 m. Averaged across species within lineages, the range margin of all animal lineages shifted upslope, but that of plants did not. For animals, the observed shifts were probably due to shifts in temperature and not to changes in habitat conditions. The range margin of plants is therefore apparently not constrained by temperature, a result contrasting recent findings. The mean shift of birds (165 m) was within the predicted range and consistent with a recent global meta-analysis. However, the upslope shift of the three insect lineages (>260 m) exceeded the expected shift even after considering several sources of uncertainty, which indicated a non-linear response to temperature. Our analysis demonstrated broad differences among lineages in their response to climate change even within one region. Furthermore, on the considered scale, the response of ectothermic animals was not consistent with expectations based on shifts in the mean annual temperature. Irrespective of the reasons for the overshooting of the response of the insects, these shifts lead to reorganizations in the composition of assemblages with consequences for ecosystem processes.

AB  - The Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian time is the cradle of multicellular, eukaryotic life and thereafter metazoan life started populating the planet. Biomarkers, which record the chronicles of biotic events on Earth, have been investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from a suite of nine oil samples extracted from oil stained sediments and a crude oil of Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian age from Bikaner-Nagaur Basin, western India. The biomarker distribution is characterized by high concentration of both tricyclic terpanes and pentacyclic hopanes. The predominance of C-29 regular sterane over C-27 and C-28 steranes indicates green algal contribution and may imply the prominence and diversification of the same algal group. The low pristane/phytane ratio and occurrence of substantial quantity of gammacerane, monomethyl 2-methyl-2-(2,4,8-trimethyltridecyl) chroman and 1,1,7,8-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4 tetrahydrophenanthrene are indicative of stratified water column as well as anoxic and enhanced salinity condition of the environment of deposition. This paper reports for the first time the presence of methyltrimethyltridecyl chromans (MTTCs) from Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian time. Putative C-19 norsteranes, probably indicative of sponge input, are recorded in the studied samples and also reported from other infracambrian oils and sediments. Normal alkanes (n-C-17 and n-C-18) and isoprenoids (pristane and phytane) are highly depleted in delta C-13. The overall biomarker distribution and carbon isotope data of oils from Bikaner-Nagaur Basin show similarities with those of other infracambrian oils like Huqf oils from Oman and Baykit High oils from eastern Siberia.

AB  - We explored the role of light-saturated (carbon-limited) photosynthesis on delta C-13 of turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig) populations from the clear, blue waters of the Great Bahama Bank and the turbid, green waters of Florida Bay using field observations and radiative transfer models. Consistent with numerous previous observations, leaf delta C-13 decreased significantly with water depth in both regions. However the delta C-13 for Bahamas turtlegrass was 3 parts per thousand heavier than that for Florida Bay turtlegrass at equivalent depths, and broadband irradiance explained even less of the delta C-13 variations than depth. Instead, leaf delta C-13 showed a stronger relationship to the fraction of the day that photosynthesis of the intact plant canopy was carbon-limited. When the Bahamas and Florida Bay delta C-13 values were related to the fraction of the day that photosynthesis was carbon-limited, the variations in leaf delta C-13 observed for Florida and Bahamas populations collapsed into a single relationship that explained 65% of the variation in leaf delta C-13. Consequently, turtlegrass from the Bahamas was isotopically heavier than Florida Bay populations growing at equivalent depths because they were more carbon-limited (= light-saturated) for a larger fraction of the day. The ability to predict turtlegrass delta C-13 from the daily period of carbon-limited photosynthesis provides a mechanistic link to fundamental relationships between light and photosynthesis that can transcend geographic differences in depth and water-column optical properties, and may permit leaf delta C-13 to provide a robust indicator of recent photosynthetic performance and plant survival in response to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Geochemical tracers, including Ba, Co, Th, (7)Be, (137)Cs and (210)Pb, and magnetic properties were used to characterize terrestrial runoff collected in nearshore time-series sediment traps in Hanalei Bay, Kauai, during flood and dry conditions in summer 2006, and to fingerprint possible runoff sources in the lower watershed. In combination, the tracers indicate that runoff during a flood in August could have come from cultivated taro fields bordering the lower reach of the river. Land-based runoff associated with summer floods may have a greater impact on coral reef communities in Hanalei Bay than in winter because sediment persists for several months. During dry periods, sediment carried by the Hanalei River appears to have been mobilized primarily by undercutting of low (7)Be, low (137)Cs riverbanks composed of soil weathered from tholeiitic basalt with low Ba and Co concentrations. Following a moderate rainfall event in September, high (7)Be sediment carried by the Hanalei River was probably mobilized by overland flow in the upper watershed. Ba-desorption in low-salinity coastal water limited its use to a qualitative runoff tracer in nearshore sediment. (210)Pb had limited usefulness as a terrestrial tracer in the nearshore due to a large dissolved oceanic source and scavenging onto resuspended bottom sediment. (210)Pb-scavenging does, however, illustrate the role resuspension could play in the accumulation of particle-reactive contaminants in nearshore sediment. Co and (137)Cs were not affected by desorption or geochemical scavenging and showed the greatest potential as quantitative sediment provenance indicators in material collected in nearshore sediment traps.

AB  - Seed growth characteristics and sucrose synthase activity in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) were examined in a field experiment at Merredin, Western Australia. 'Sona', a small-seeded desi cultivar, and 'Kaniva', a large-seeded kabuli cultivar, were grown after flowering with irrigation and under a rainout shelter, used to induce terminal drought. Seed and pod wall dry weight followed a similar pattern in the two cultivars with terminal drought significantly reducing the dry weight of the pod wall and seed in both cultivars. The pod wall reached its maximum dry weight 21 days after podding (DAP) in 'Kaniva' and 28 and 35 DAP in 'Sona' with terminal drought and irrigation, respectively. The dry weight of the pod wall decreased during seed filling, particularly in the plants subjected to terminal drought. The increase in seed dry weight followed a sigmoid curve with a lag phase of 14 DAP and 21 DAP in 'Kaniva' and 'Sona', respectively, followed by a rapid almost-linear phase until 35 DAP when the dry weight leveled off and even decreased slightly near maturity. Sucrose synthase activity peaked at 32 DAP in 'Kaniva' and 35 DAP in 'Sona' and then decreased to near zero at maturity. A significant and positive association was observed between seed dry weight at maturity and peak sucrose synthase activity in both cultivars and both treatments. We suggest that sucrose synthase is a good physiological indicator for use in breeding for improved seed size in chickpea.

Collections from 13 cruises (176 trawls) from 2004 to 2006 yielded over 17,000,000 micronekton individuals (350,000 excluding euphausiids), representing 76 taxa and 43 families. The community was numerically dominated by euphausiids, followed in decreasing order by midwater shrimp (Sergestes similis), lanternfishes (Myctophidae), late larval/juvenile rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), age-0 Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and pelagic squid (Abraliopsis felis). We used cluster analysis, ordinations, multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (ISA) to examine community structure of the 28 dominant taxa. Ordination and cluster results indicated that distance from shore and sea-floor depth best characterized habitats used by different assemblages of the micronekton community. Temperature and salinity at various depths influenced community structure to a lesser extent, along with Ekman transport. MRPP and ISA results indicated that nearly all dominant taxa were associated with cross-shelf gradients. Based upon a comparison between historical samples collected in 1976 and 1981 and comparable trawls from this survey, distinct decadal differences among micronektonic fish assemblages were observed, including more juvenile flatfishes and rockfishes but a lower diversity of mesopelagic fishes, which may be related to interdecadal environmental changes between the two time periods. This study represents the first examination of the relationships between both vertebrate and invertebrate members of the epipelagic nekton community. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Establishment of native vegetation is one method of stabilizing shifting soil and minimizing fine particulate dust air pollution from barren, dry lakebeds worldwide. Successful colonization, however, hinges on native seedlings' ability to survive and grow in these stressful environments. We studied the effects of soil amendment on two halophytic shrub species (Atriplex parryi and Sarcobatus vermiculatus) native to Owens Lake, California, to determine effects of locally available soil amendments (fertilizer, clay, and Distichlis spicata leaf litter) on plant growth and survival. We used changes in leaf nutrient concentrations, shoot growth, and root allocation as indicators of plant nutrient uptake and of limitations in unamended native soils. We report results from both a partial factorial greenhouse study and summary data from a similar field study. Amendment additions of clay or organic matter did not increase biomass of seedlings significantly, while additions of fertilizer more than doubled growth compared to controls (P <= 0.004). For S. vermiculatus, neither clay nor organic matter in combination with fertilizer increased biomass significantly over that of fertilizer alone. Atriplex parryi biomass increased twofold with clay and fertilizer together over that of fertilizer alone. Soil NO3-, B, and Na were highest in clay plus fertilizer treatments and the salt tolerant A. parryi was able to use the additional NO3- under these conditions. These results suggest how nutrient limitations affect seedling establishment and will aid managers in determining the best approach to increase seedling growth and survival of shrubs at the saline, sandy Owens Lake playa.

AB  - Background: Hypophosphatemia is a condition that affects feed intake and milk production in dairy cows, and, to assess it, a precise biological parameter is needed. Plasma inorganic phosphate (Pi) can be used as a potential indicator of bioavailability of feed phosphorus in dairy cows. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of sample type (serum vs. plasma), blood sampling site (jugular vs. coccygeal), and morning feeding on blood Pi concentration in dairy cows. Methods: Blood samples from 28 clinically healthy multiparous Holstein cows were analyzed for Pi concentration. The animals were sampled twice by coccygeal vessel into Vacutainer tubes both with and without sodium heparin, 3 hours after the morning feeding. In 4 additional cows, the concentration of Pi was measured in blood samples obtained simultaneously by jugular and coccygeal venipuncture into heparinized tubes before the morning feeding and 2, 4, and 6 hours after the feeding. The results were analyzed using parametric statistical tests. Results: Serum and plasma concentrations of Pi were correlated (r(2) = 0.999, P <.0001), but serum Pi concentration was higher than plasma Pi (P .02). Plasma Pi concentration 2 hours after feeding tended to be higher than that before feeding in jugular samples, but the difference was not significant. There was no significant variation in plasma Pi during the morning postfeeding times, although jugular concentrations were 19% lower than coccygeal (P = .04). Conclusion: To increase the precision of plasma Pi measurements as an indicator of bioavailability of feed phosphorus, sample type, sampling time, and site must be taken into account, to correctly interpret plasma Pi concentrations.

AB  - We investigated the influence of dead wood amount and trees with nesting holes on species communities of birds, saproxylic beetles and wood-inhabiting fungi in beech forests. Data have been gathered in a standardized way in beech stands of three categories with different forest-use intensities in Southern Germany. While stands of the first category are subject to intense silviculture of high-quality beech, dead wood structures and trees with nesting cavities have been protected in the second commercial forest category for 30 years. There has been no wood withdrawal in the third category for 25 years. Therefore, dead wood structures and age of these stands are comparable to pristine forests. The main differences show up in dead wood amounts and in trees with nesting cavities. No differences were found in the total number of species and individuals. This is in stark contrast to species groups which indicate environments close to pristine conditions, such as wood-inhabiting birds and cavity breeding birds, as well as saproxylic beetles and wood-inhabiting fungi decline significantly with increasing thinning activity intensity. From our results we conclude that in deciduous forest logging, even if done selectively, will reduce the numbers of species with higher demand on structures typical for pristine or close to pristine forests. For a monitoring of forest influence in beech dominated forests it is important to focus on these indicator groups and not on the total number of species to recognize degradation in forest species.

AB  - Pesticide applications to agricultural lands in California, USA, are reported to a central data base, while data on water and sediment quality are collected by a number of monitoring programs. Data from both sources are geo-referenced, allowing spatial analysis of relationships between pesticide application rates and the chemical and biological condition of water bodies. This study collected data from 12 watersheds, selected to represent a range of pesticide usage. Water quality parameters were measured during six surveys of stream sites receiving runoff from the selected watershed areas. This study had three objectives: to evaluate the usefulness of pesticide application data in selecting regional monitoring sites, to provide information for generating and testing hypotheses about pesticide fate and effects, and to determine whether in-stream nitrate concentration was a useful surrogate indicator for regional monitoring of toxic substances. Significant correlations were observed between pesticide application rates and in-stream pesticide concentrations (p < 0.05) and toxicity (p < 0.10). In-stream nitrate concentrations were not significantly correlated with either the amount of pesticides applied, in-stream pesticide concentrations, or in-stream toxicity (all p > 0.30). Neither total watershed area nor the area in which pesticide usage was reported correlated significantly with the amount of pesticides applied, in-stream pesticide concentrations, or in-stream toxicity (all p > 0.14). In-stream pesticide concentrations and effects were more closely related to the intensity of pesticide use than to the area under cultivation.

AB  - Arsenic is a ubiquitous element. Its toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation depend usually on its chemical form, and therefore, arsenic speciation is indispensable for the assessment of environmental risk and human hazard. Little is known about the effect of sample preparation procedures, such as drying and storage, on the resulting arsenic speciation. In this study, we investigated the influence of different drying methods and storage conditions on the arsenic speciation in mineral soils, organic soils, and plants. Drying soils and plants using different methods may change the concentrations of the total methanol-water (20%, v/v) extractable arsenic, the proportion of organic arsenic and the ratio of arsenite-to-arsenate. Loss of methanol-water extractable arsenic compounds (up to 63%) was observed particularly in the samples rich in water. Following drying, the speciation of organic arsenic changed less than that of inorganic arsenic. Drying showed little influence on the total arsenic determination. None of the storage methods tested could preserve the arsenic speciation in organic soils and plants, although arsenic speciation after one-month storage varied less in freeze-dried samples than wet samples. Storage of the samples at low temperatures (2 or -20 degrees C) had the largest impact on the samples rich in organic matters, leading to less arsenic being extractable by methanol-water. Both drying and storage of the soil and plant samples changed apparently the arsenic speciation. Therefore, we recommend conducting the arsenic speciation possibly with fresh and wet samples, so that the results of arsenic speciation may be more approaching the original states.

AB  - Successful biological control of invasive weeds with specialist herbivorous insects is predicated on the assumption that the injury stresses the weeds sufficiently to cause reductions in individual fitness. Because plant gas exchange directly impacts growth and fitness, characterizing how injury affects these primary processes may provide a key indicator of physiological impairment which then may lead to reductions in fitness. The objective of this study was to use physiological methods to evaluate bow the invasive weed, Linaria dalmatica L. Miller (Dalmatian toadflax), is affected by two introduced biological control agents within different injury guilds: the stem-boring weevil, Mecinus janthinus Germar, and the defoliating moth, Calophasia lunula Hufnagel. All studies with M. janthinus were conducted under field conditions at two sites in Montana in 2003 and 2004. For C. lunula evaluations, a total of five greenhouse studies in 2003 and 2004 were used. One field study in 2003 and two studies in 2004 also were conducted. Variables measured included net CO2 exchange rate, stomata] conductance, and transpiration rate. Results from both field sites revealed that the primary physiology of Dalmatian toadflax was deleteriously affected by M. janthinus larval injury. There were no significant differences among treatments for any of the gas exchange variables measured in all eight experiments with C. lunula. Our results indicate that insect herbivores in two distinct injury guilds differentially affect Dalmatian toadflax physiology. Based on the primary physiological parameters evaluated in this study, M. janthinus had more impact on Dalmatian toadflax than C. lunula. With such information, improved risk-benefit decisions can be made about whether to release exotic biological control agents.

AB  - Early mature, Pukeiwitahi Formation (Late Cretaceous) coals from Galleon-1 and Endeavour-1 wells in the Canterbury Basin, New Zealand have been analysed by petrographic, bulk chemical and thermal extraction- and pyrolysis-GC techniques and compared with similar coals in the Taranaki Basin to determine the primary controls on their paraffinic oil potential. The Pukeiwitahi coals, which are moderately perhydrous (HI 180-305 mgHC g(-1)TOC), vitrinite-rich (73-95%) and relatively liptinite-poor (<10%), accumulated in gymnosperm-dominated, planar mires in a temperate, coastal plain environment. Pyrolysate compositions are representative of high-wax, paraffinic-naphthenic-aromatic crude oil-generating coals. Petrographic data and the n-alkyl chain length distributions of extracts and pyrolysates suggest that the long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons are derived primarily from leaf-derived liptinites (cutinite and liptodetrinite). The paraffinic oil potential of the coals is accordingly dependent on the net amount of leaf biomass in the precursor peats, following partial degradation of the available leaf litter under generally high surface water levels and dilution with other, less paraffinic biomass, particularly wood. The coals in Endeavour-1 generally contain more leaf-derived liptinites than those in Galleon-1 and, thus, have greater paraffinic oil potentials despite commonly lower HI values. Brackish conditions within the depositional environment caused the Galleon-l and Endeavour-1 coals to be variably enriched in hydrogen but not in aliphatics. HI is, therefore, not a reliable indicator of the paraffinic oil potential of marine-influenced coals.

AB  - In the Chaine des Puys, a volcanic mountain range in the French Massif Central, stands of silver birch and Scots pine have naturally regenerated during the past five decades. The woodlands have developed on former croplands, pastures and beathlands. Soil properties, species composition and dendrometric stand characteristics were investigated at sites of similar altitude and topographic conditions. Soils from the southern and northern parts of the study area differ in volcanic ash composition. Those of the nor-them part are afforested by birch and have developed mainly on trachytic ash; they have lower pH values and show accumulation of Fe-Al organic complexes. Soils of the southern part, afforested by Scots pine, are mostly on basaltic ash and have a higher pH, much less organic matter and more allophane. Soils of former croplands have lower C/N ratios, higher delta(15)N contents and greater potential N mineralization than those of former heathlands and pastures. The flora of the birch woodlands differs from that of the Scots pine woodlands and also varies with former land use, mainly because of different N availabilities. Woodlands established on former heathlands and pastures were more dense but less mature than stands on former croplands. Volcanic ash chemistry and the intensity of former agricultural use are key factors influencing present soil fertility, plant composition and stand development. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - dPyrolysis of lignite at high pressure and high temperature (HPT) was conducted to investigate the potential stable carbon isotopic fractionation of the produced gaseous hydrocarbons. The experiments were done in a closed system at temperatures of 500-700 degreesC and pressures of 1-3 gigapascals (GPas). Gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometric analysis (GC-C-irMS) of the produced gaseous hydrocarbons leads to two important observations. First, the distribution of the delta(13)C values for methane, ethane, propane and butane shows a clear reversal, with delta(13)C(1)>delta(13)C(2)>delta(13)C(3) >delta(13)C(4). The relatively C-13-enriched methane and C-13-depleted butane is in contrast to the widely accepted isotope distribution pattern of biogenic gases and is similar to that reported for abiogenic gases. Second, carbon dioxide produced from the pyrolysis of lignite is relatively enriched in C-13, with delta(13)C values (-18.6 to -22.3parts per thousand) that are much higher than those of the gaseous hydrocarbons and lignite itself (-26.8parts per thousand). These findings suggest a possible scenario that gaseous hydrocarbons can be generated from organic matter under the HPT conditions of the lower lithosphere, particularly in subduction regions where sedimentary organic matter might be introduced into the mantle, and that the reversal in the stable carbon isotopes of gaseous hydrocarbons may not be an exclusive indicator of abiogenic gases. Therefore, isotope criteria commonly used to differentiate biogenic from abiogenic gases should be used with caution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Red cabbage dye is a natural pigment used mainly as a food color. A class of compounds called anthocyanins attributes to this color. The pH of the red cabbage solution can also affect both its color and intensity. The objective of this study was to determine the ionization constant (pK(a)) of red cabbage color. the effect of pH and temperature on its stability in solution And evaluation of this natural color as a pH indicator in pharmaceutical system. Spectrophotometric method was used to determine its pK(a). The lambda(max) and absorbencies of the red cabbage color at different concentrations and pH were determined. The analytical wavelength (AW) is the wavelength at which the greatest difference in absorbencies between ionized and molecular Species Occurs was determined. The absorbencies of red cabbage solution (0.12% w/v) at different pH values ranging from 5.0 to 8.0 (with increments of 0.2), was measured at the AW of 612 nm. The resulted absorbencies ranged from 0.31 to 1.91 and were used to determine its pK(a). The pK(a) determined by this method was within a range of 6.8-7.2. Results from this Study demonstrated that red cabbage dye could be used as a pH indicator in pharmaceutical formulations. In acidic condition. it has its original red color but at a basic pH its color changes to deep blue. This color is more stable at a low temperature and pH. Its ability to act as a pH indicator was further tested using chlorbutol solution as a model system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - After 30 years of abandonment, a block-cut peatland near Cacouna, Quebec, Canada, has naturally regenerated Sphagnum mosses on < 10% of its area, typical for these disturbed systems. Distinct hydrologic conditions were observed where Sphagnum has successfully recolonized, providing a basis for establishing thresholds that can be targeted by peatland restoration managers. Sites where Sphagnum mosses recolonized were characterized by high water table (mean-24.9<plus/minus>14.3 cm), soil moisture (theta) > 50%, and soil-water pressure (Psi) >-100 mb. These hydrologic indicators were spatially organized according to the morphology of block- cut trenches, which typically include raised baulks, shallow ditches, and the convex skag (unused turf) deposits along the central axis of the trench. Topographically low areas like the shallow ditches (D) and lower parts of the skag (LS) adjacent to the ditches maintained theta and Psi > 50% and -100 mb, respectively, for 100% of the summer period. About 83% of all Sphagnum recolonization that occurred in the study trench did so in these areas. In more raised areas like the mid- and center portion of the skag, a and Psi eventually fell below these thresholds, and these areas generally did not support Sphagnum, except in a few localized microtopographic depressions in the lower (downslope) end of the trench. While this lower end of the trench had all the Sphagnum species that were present in the trench, even there it was only 38% of the total area. It seems that even short periods of low Psi may restrict Sphagnum reestablishment in an otherwise favorably wet site.

AB  - Seasonal changes in all major and minor photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants were studied in sun and shade in beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) leaves and buds under Mediterranean conditions. Both sun and shade leaves differed progressively in their biochemical and morphological characteristics during the course of leaf ageing. Sun leaves were 3-fold thicker, pigment content was highly reduced and the leaves were protected by a much more powerful antioxidative system. Pigment content decreased progressively during summer in sun leaves and remained stable in shade leaves. From July to September, there was no chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, so photodegradation of Chl was not compensated by production of new Chl. This reduction in Chl occurred in parallel with an increment in tocopherols. Natural leaf senescence occurred first in sun leaves. During this process, Chl was completely degraded, xanthophylls were esterified with fatty acids, and violaxanthin was converted into zeaxanthin, while carotenes remained stable. One of the main indicators of tree decline and air pollution is accelerated leaf ageing, and this process is characterised in beech leaves by tocopherol and pigment destruction, so we have used these criteria to verify whether these parameters can be used as early indicators of tree decline. All pigments and antioxidants (including alpha -tocopherol) decreased with beech decline, except xanthophyll cycle pigments. As reduction of these compounds is concomitant with a similar level of Chl degradation, Chl determination is proposed as a simple method sufficient to predict the early stages of beech decline at a biochemical level.

AB  - A study was performed to estimate the extent of cow injuries as an indicator of animal welfare in organic dairy farms in Switzerland. The study was conducted during the winter feeding period of 1997/98 and was part of a larger project on animal health, nutrition and production in certified organic dairy herds in Switzerland. Potential predictors of injuries related to animal housing were quantified and relations between occurrence of injuries and nutritional status and production were evaluated. The investigation was designed as a cross-sectional study and included a representative sample of 152 farms and 1856 cows. Every farm was visited once and each cow was scored for claw-, skin- and joint-lesions and body condition. Statistical analyses were performed appropriate for a stratified and one-stage cluster sample weighted for the entire population of organic dairy farms in Switzerland. Possible individual and environmental predictors of cow injuries were analysed using multinomial legit models for ordinal outcomes. The overall frequencies of injuries were 10.4 % for joint lesions, 12.8 % for soft-tissue injuries and 3.6 % for claw lesions. Most joint injuries (84.9 %) were observed at the hock joint, 9.4 % at the carpus and 3.1% at the knee joint. The analysis of the association between frequency of injuries and potential predictors revealed heterogeneous results and the risk profiles were different between the categories of injuries measured in the study. These observations support the assumption that variations in type and severity of injuries are due to specific differences of animal management, housing design and due to different characteristics of individual cows.

AB  - Fe-Mn concretions are stable indicators of water regimes in loamy and clay podsolic and soddy-podsolic soils. Their spatial distribution is, in a large part, an inheritance of several processes in a heterogeneous soil medium. The objective of this study was to examine whether fractal models are appropriate to describe the spatial distributions of concretions. Data were collected at three locations in the Moscow region. At the first location, there were eight plots at depths from 13 to 34 cm and the distributions of concretions larger that 0.5 mm were mapped by staining the individual concretions. At the remaining two locations, soil cores of different sizes were taken from two depths. Concretions were extracted from these cores and sieved to separate them by size. A method of thorough sampling of the area was employed that used estimates of fractal dimension for the every possible position a fixed geometrical form by using the box counting technique. These estimates were studied statistically and by comparison with simulated data. We found concretion distribution on the fixed depth to have at least three components. The first of them represents the background, i.e., it corresponds to the random and independent distributions of concretions. The second component has fractal nature. The third component represents dense nests and it is probably connected with favorable conditions for microorganisms forming concretions. Estimated dimensions greater than 2.5 belong to the nest component and less than 1.6-to the fractal one. The interval (1.6; 2.5) of them can be accounted for only by the random distribution.

AB  - In 1977, a four-course rotation was set up at Ropsley (UK) to study crop response to eight rates of nitrogen application (35-265 kg ha(-1)). This rotation continued until 1990 when continuous winter wheat was introduced. Results from 1978 to 1990 provide an opportunity to study the initial phase of cumulative effects from different rates of N fertilizer application on the recovery of N by cereals and the retention of N in the soil.
   From 1978 to 1990, considerable variation in the recovery of nitrogen by winter wheat was observed. Neither rainfall nor drainage, as indicators of possible denitrification or leaching losses, provided a useful explanation for this, possibly because of the relatively dry conditions prevailing after spring fertilizer application. There was no evidence of increased soil N fertility, beyond single year residues, as a result of large N applications over the 13-year period.
   In order to achieve the economic optimum grain yield, it was necessary to use N applications which produced inefficient recovery of N. Thus, greater return of N in crop residues and immobilization at relatively large N applications (> 150 kg ha(-1)) contributed to an observed build-up in soil organic N over the period of study. Plots receiving, on average, 265 kg ha(-1) appeared to gain c. 250 kg ha(-1) N over control plots (35 kg ha(-1)) after 13 years of N application. Reducing the N application rate from the economic optimum to a more biologically efficient N rate (156 kg ha(-1)) was calculated to result in an average yield loss of 0.305 t ha(-1) and cause an estimated pound 17 ha(-1) loss in profit.

AB  - Bacterial abundance, bacterial secondary production (BSP) and potential ectoproteolytic activity (PEA) were measured at 6 stations along the Strait of Magellan, South America, toward the end of summer 1995. Because of hydrological and climatic factors, 3 main areas could be identified in which the bacterial component displayed specific characteristics. In the Pacific Ocean side, subjected to freshwater inputs from rainfalls and melting of glaciers, the bacterial activities showed the highest values (BSP: 228.2 ng C l(-1) h(-1); PEA: 12.2 nmol l(-1) h(-1)). The bacterial biomass was greater than the phytoplanktonic biomass, probably due to organic inputs from land stimulating the bacterial growth. The central part of the Strait demonstrated the lowest values (BSP: 32.6 ng C l(-1) h(-1), PEA: 4.6 nmol l(-1) h(-1)), although the ratio of bacterial biomass to phytoplanktonic biomass was greater than 1. In the third area, the Atlantic Ocean opening, subjected to strong tidal currents, BSP and PEA displayed high values, 80 to 88.7 ng C l(-1) h(-1) and 11.7 nmol l(-1) h(-1) respectively, Nevertheless, the ratio of bacterial to phytoplanktonic biomass was less than 1, like in eutrophic areas. On the other hand, no impact of the tide was noted on bacterial parameters. Considering all samples measured in the 0 to 50 m layer, although BSP and PEA were positively correlated with bacterial abundance, the PEA to BSP ratio was negatively correlated with the bacterial biomass (r=-0.72, p<0.001, n=22). This ratio could be an indicator of trophic conditions in the 3 subsystems of the Strait.

AB  - Siliceous microfossils (diatoms, chrysophytes, and freshwater sponges) preserved in a radiometrically dated core from Hamilton Harbour (Lake Ontario, Canada) were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to assess the effects of human activities during the past 330 years. Changes in trophic status, temperature, and organic and heavy-metal contamination were inferred. Our data show that striking changes in the diatom flora resulted from anthropogenic activities in the catchment. Prior to European settlement of the region microfossil deposition rates were low, and the diatom flora was dominated by oligotrophic indicators, such as Aulacoseira islandica. Early settlement effects during the period ca. 1770-1820 are reflected by increasing abundance of taxa typical of mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions, particularly Fragilaria construens, Aulacoseira ambigua, and A. granulata. A sharp increase in the production of siliceous microfossils from 1790-1800, suggesting early eutrophication, coincided with historical records of deforestation and farming. Assemblages deposited between ca. 1840 and 1930 indicate increased eutrophication and the first evidence of pollution from industrial development and urbanization. Increasing numbers of anomalous forms of Stephanodiscus parvus during the period 1932-1970 suggests the processes of water pollution in the harbor were accelerated. The greatest shift in composition of the diatom flora occurred after 1970, and the annual diatom flux rose to a maximum. Conversely, both chrysophyte cysts and fresh water sponges completely disappeared. Stephanodiscus niagarae, S. parvus, and Fragilaria capucina became dominant. Taxa tolerant of water pollution, such as Actinocyclus nomanii fo. subsalsa, Cyclotella meneghiniana, and Diatoma tenue var. elongatum, reached their maximum, indicating the poorest water quality in the harbor during the entire period of study.

AB  - In many developing cities, fecal sludge management has become a serious environmental issue. As the increasing urban settlement results in the generation of fecal matter that causes environmental problems, recovering and recycling fecal waste for soil amendment could be beneficial. In this study, pre-sanitized fecal sludge (FS) was collected from the ongoing FS treatment process at the University of Science and Technology Beijing and subjected to a compost-dewatering process to mitigate pathogen and moisture content (MC). Biochar and dry leaves were added to reactors 1, 2, and 3 (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1) at 10% to facilitate the degradation process. The result shows that the final MC from the 45-day experiment has values of 35.1, 37.3, 38.9, and 65% in reactors 1, 2, 3, and the control, respectively. The indicator organism (fecal coliform) was completely mitigated in reactors 1 and 2. However, fecal coliform was merely reduced from 7.2 to 5.7 log10 CFU/ 100 mL in reactor 3 and remained available in the control reactor. This phenomenon of pathogen inactivation and MC removal from FS was attributed to the concentration of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the pre-sanitized FS. The addition of LAB to the treatment process enhanced the acidification process and resulted in pathogen inactivation. Biochar and dry leaves also played an important role in mitigating moisture and enhancing the fast composting process. Given the hygienic condition of the compost, it is suitable for soil amendment in agriculture.

AB  - The Gasado Au-Ag deposit is located within the south-western margin of the Hanam-Jindo basin. The geology of the Gasado is composed of the late Cretaceous volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks and acidic or intermediate igneous rocks. Within the deposit area, there are a number of hydrothermal quartz and calcite veins, formed by narrow open space filling along subparallel fractures in the late Cretaceous volcaniclastic sedimentary rock. Vein mineralization at the Gasado is characterized by several textural varieties such as chalcedony, drusy, comb, bladed, crustiform and colloform. The textures have been used as exploring indicators of the epithermal deposit. Mineral paragenesis can be divided into two stages (stage I, ore-bearing quartz veins; stage II, barren carbonate veins) considering major tectonic fracturing event. Stage I, at which the precipitation of Au-Ag bearing minerals occurred, is further divided into three substages (early, middle and late) with paragenetic time based on minor fractures and discernible mineral assemblages: early, marked by deposition of pyrite and pyrrhotite with minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite and electrum; middle, characterized by introduction of electrum and base-metal sulfides with minor argentite; late, marked by argentite and native silver.
   Au-Ag-bearing mineralization at the Gasado deposit occurred under the condition between initial high temperatures (>= 290 degrees C) and later lower temperatures (<= 130 degrees C). Changes in stage I vein mineralogy reflect decreasing temperature and fugacity of sulfur (approximate to 10(-10.1) to <= 10(-18.5)atm) by evolution of the Gasado hydrothermal system with increasing paragenetic time. The Gasado deposit may represents an epithermal gold-silver deposit which was formed near paleo-surface.

AB  - Like many amphibians, wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) populations have likely declined or experienced local extirpations as a result of habitat alterations. Despite this, wood frogs are still present and breeding in altered landscapes, like the agricultural Prairie Pothole Region of central Canada, and are exposed to a variety of anthropogenic impacts. As tadpoles, water contamination can have negative effects on growth, development, and immune systems. To investigate the potential effects of agricultural land use on tadpole growth and immune system stress, we used boosted regression trees to model body mass, body condition, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, a measure of immune stress, against 32 variables including water quality, wetland habitat, and landscape-level measures. Developmental stage strongly influenced all 3 endpoints, and body mass was negatively influenced by higher levels of total dissolved solids (>600-700 mg/L) and at the first sign of pesticide detection (>0.01 proportion pesticides detected of those screened). While correlative, these data suggest that tadpoles developing in agricultural environments may experience survival and reproductive disadvantages if they metamorphose at smaller body sizes. Given the potential impacts this can have on adult frogs and frog populations, these results provide an impetus for further field-based investigation into the effects that pesticides, and especially total dissolved solids, may have on tadpoles.

AB  - Partial migration is common in a variety of taxa and has important ecological and evolutionary implications, yet the underlying factors that lead to different migratory strategies are not clearly understood. Given the importance of temperature in serving as a cue for migration, along with its role in regulating metabolism, growth, reproduction, and survival, we examined how intraspecific variation in critical thermal maximum (CTmax) values influenced migratory strategy (residency vs. migration), timing of migration, growth, and predation vulnerability in a wild population of partially anadromous juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). Using passive integrated transponder telemetry and mark-recapture techniques, we identified individuals that out-migrated to sea, assumed residency, and were predated by cormorants several months later. Acute thermal stress induced by conducting CTmax trials did not affect the final fate of assayed fish compared with controls. We found that mass and body condition predicted CTmax and migration timing, but CTmax failed to predict migratory strategy or timing, growth (of resident fish), or predation vulnerability. Although there may be links between mass, thermal tolerance, and migration strategy, the relationship between CTmax and migration remains unclear. The role of upper thermal tolerance in influencing life-history strategies should not be neglected, however, as alternative indicators of thermal tolerance could be further explored. The high degree of variation in CTmax estimates warrants additional investigation of how increasingly prevalent high-temperature events might drive selection toward thermally tolerant extremes, which is particularly relevant in a rapidly warming world.

AB  - Environmental stressors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, photoperiod, etc. under tropical conditions are some of the important limiting factors for optimum expression of production and reproduction in dairy cows. The present study evaluated changes in cardinal physiological responses, heat tolerance indices, and milk yield in Jersey crossbred cows due to abiotic stress. Climograph was developed using daily maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity, and rainfall at livestock farm over a period of 15 years. Seasons significantly (P < 0.01) influenced cardinal physiological responses and thermal adaptability of Jersey crossbred cows. Diurnal environmental variations between morning and afternoon of the shed caused increase in body temperature, pulse, and respiration rate by 0.59-0.91%, 4.95-7.18%, and 9.73-32.37%, respectively. Thermal adaptability of cows showed significant (P < 0.01) higher deviations from perfect state of adaptability during summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon as compared to winter and spring seasons. The responsiveness and ranking of cows were dissimilar among 3 heat tolerance indices, viz., Iberia heat tolerance index, Benezara's coefficient of adaptability, and Dairy Search Index (DSI). Enhanced respiration rate was the most important observable bio-indicator to poor thermal adaptability. Good thermo-tolerant cows had 8.86% higher (P < 0.05) monthly milk yield per cow than poorly adapted ones. Findings of this study suggest that deviations in cardinal physiological responses across the seasons are very reliable and simple estimates for evaluating levels of thermo-tolerance in crossbred cows.

AB  - This study compares the variation of richness, abundance and diversity of butterfly species along an at-mospheric pollution gradient and during different seasons in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area, Mexico. Likewise, we analyse the influence of environmental variables on the abundance and richness of butterfly species and quantify the indicator species for each atmospheric pollution category. Based on spatial analy-sis of the main atmospheric pollutants and the vegetation cover conditions, four permanent sampling sites were delimited. The sampling was carried out monthly in each of the sites using aerial entomological nets and ten Van Someren-Rydon traps during May 2018 to April 2019. A total of 8,570 specimens belong-ing to six families and 209 species were collected. Both species richness and abundance were significantly different between all sites, except for the comparison between the moderate contamination site and the high contamination site; diversity decreased significantly with increasing levels of contamination. The sea-sonality effect was absent on species richness; however, for species abundance the differences between dry season and rainy season were significant in each site excepting the moderate contamination site. Regard-ing diversity, the seasonal effect showed different distribution patterns according to each order. Relative humidity, vegetation cover and three pollution variables were highly correlated with both abundance and & nbsp;species richness. From the total number of species found, only 47 had a significant indicator value. This study constitutes the first faunistic contribution of butterflies as indicators of the environmental quality of urban areas in Mexico, which will help in the development of strategies for the management, planning and conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Improved assessment and prediction of soil organic nitrogen (SON) mineralization is essential, as it contributes significantly to the nitrogen (N) nutrition of crops and remains a major economic and environmental challenge. SON mineralization is a function of soil properties, land use and climate, which led us to monitor a network of 137 cultivated fields covering the wide diversity of soils, crop rotations and cropping practices throughout Brittany (France). SON mineralization was quantified by the mineral N balance calculated for a maize crop not fertilized with N; it was determined by measuring soil mineral N (SMN) in the 0-90 cm soil profile in March (Ni) and October (Nf) and N uptake by the maize crop, and predicting nitrate leaching (N-leached) using the STICS model. SMN and plant N uptake were measured in triplicate. To predict N-leached , STICS was initialized at the date of Ni measurement. In addition, the experimental design was based on estimating SON for three consecutive years (2012-2014) to improve the accuracy of measuring mineralization. An indicator of the cropping system (I_Sys) was developed that integrated well the effects of crop rotation and the frequency of manure application; it can be considered a good index of effects of the cropping system on SON mineralization. This dataset may be used for a variety of applications, such as analysing effects of soil properties, cropping history and climatic conditions on SON mineralization, or evaluating the accuracy of soil-plant models (e.g. STICS, CERES).

AB  - Heavy metal exposure from anthropogenic pollutants negatively affects many marine organisms, including foraminiferan protists. As such, foraminifera are often used as bioindicators of stressed environmental conditions. Primary research has commonly focused on how heavy metals affect foraminiferal assemblages, ultrastructure, and shell morphology; however, little if any data have been reported on how heavy metals affect their physiological functions. Here we measure respiration rates of individual foraminifera after acute exposure to three concentrations of toxic but sub-lethal levels of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd). These experiments relied on the large cell size of an agglutinated Antarctic foraminifer, Astrammina rara. Cells were isolated from sediment collected by scuba divers in Explorers Cove, Antarctica. In the laboratory, individual, live cells were removed from their shells and placed in sealed respirometry chambers with either normal or Pb- or Cd-spiked artificial seawater. Cells in the process of shell formation were used to ensure that all individuals were aerobically active and in similar metabolic states. Noninvasive oxygen-sensing optode technology was used to measure oxygen consumption during the first 24-36 h of shell formation. The average respiration rate was 1.07 nmol O-2 h(-1) (range 0.78-1.84 nmol O-2 h(-1)) for normal cells. We compared the results from each exposure group to this baseline rate and found that both Pb and Cd significantly suppressed the respiration rate of A. rara in all but the highest level of Pb exposure. This study provides a novel, powerful, and short-term way to measure foraminiferal physiological responses to heavy metal toxicants.

AB  - The present work emphasizes the development of a generic methodology that addresses the core issue of any running chemical plant, i.e., how to maintain a delicate balance between profit and environmental impact. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) production plant has been taken as a case study. The production of EO takes place in a multiphase catalytic reactor, the reliable first principle-based model of which is still not available in the literature. Artificial neural network (ANN) was therefore applied to develop a data-driven model of the complex reactor with the help of actual industrial data. The model successfully built up a correlation between the catalyst selectivity and other operational parameters. This model was used to establish two objective functions, profit and environmental impact. In this paper, the negative environmental impact has been designated by Eco-indicator 99, which considers all the negative health and environmental impacts of a certain product. A recently developed metaheuristic optimization technique, namely multi-objective firefly (MOF) algorithm, was used to develop Pareto diagram of profit vs. Eco-99. The Pareto diagram will help the plant engineers to make strategy on what operating conditions to be maintained to make a delicate balance between profit and environmental impact. It was also found that by applying this modeling and optimization technique, for a 130 kTA EO plant, approximately 7048 t/year of carbon dioxide can be saved from emission into the atmosphere.

AB  - Sustainable crop production is a significant challenge in China. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to evaluate environmental impacts related to the sustainable development of crop production by integrating scientific and practical indicators. Therefore, this study employed emergy and index decomposition analysis approaches to assess the environmental impacts of non-point source pollution and the overall performance of crop production in China's 31 provinces. First, the emergy flow of emission impacts and two new indicators, the emergy sustainability index and the emergy-based pollutant-producing coefficient, were proposed to comprehensively measure crop production performance from 2012 to 2015. The results demonstrated that the environmental impacts of non-point source pollution (EIN) were predominantly attributed to total nitrogen and phosphorus contents and mulching film residuals, which substantially increased the total emergy used and reduced the sustainability of crop production in each province. The ratio of EIN plus purchased resources (F) to total emergy used (U) were consistently greater than 80% in all 31 provinces, while the ratio of local resources including the emergy of local renewable (R) and non-renewable resources (N) to the total emergy was relatively small, accounting for less than 20% in all provinces. Then, a logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition method was applied to identify the key driving forces influencing the evolution of EIN. The decomposition analysis indicated that the economy factor had a major promoting effect on EIN growth in all provinces except Beijing and Shanghai. Intensity and technology factors had a limiting effect on EIN growth. These findings provide valuable insights for developing appropriate crop production policies that consider local conditions.

AB  - Activity of public administration is one of the most evaluated aspects involving hundreds of stakeholders across Ukraine. It is an important topic, as evaluation is one of the main ways for collection of the useful evidence for policymaking. Evaluation can be defined as the collection of evidence for formulating a judgement on the merits of an intervention, programme or policy. There is an unsolved task to provide an in-depth analysis with up-to-date information on the role of the evaluation of regional public authorities and local self-government institutions' activities. The article shows a number of evaluation methods for the public authorities' activities and reveals the factors that explain the current situation. The authors propose indicators that meet current trends, in particular the concept of sustainable development, within which the world community is moving. The system of balanced indicators allows to link strategic goals and key indicators that measure the degree of their achievement in the regions. The formation of a perfect evaluation system for the public authorities' activities includes monitoring of the obtained results, their comparison with the forecast and plan under the condition of clearly defined costs in advance. This involves the use of a set of indicators, in particular: indicators that characterize economic and financial sustainability, those which assess institutional development, social transformation, environmental responsibility and energy efficiency. The influence of the public opinion makes any management process more or less public, so it is necessary to intensify the process of the public monitoring of the services provided by the public authorities, with further response or accumulation of the information for further consideration.

AB  - The basis for formulating and implementing the urban environment is to be able to accurately evaluate the environmental performance of the city. The accuracy of urban environmental performance evaluation is the mapping of urban environmental conditions and the basis for regional differences between different cities, but the current performance evaluation system has evaluation accuracy. Because of the problem of low and low applicability, a performance evaluation system for the optimization of urban environment by three-dimensional greening under the concept of low carbon was established. Based on the interconnection and complementary relationship between promoting urban economic development and three-dimensional greening construction, based on the principles of science, pertinence, comprehensiveness, dynamics and maneuverability, scientific, easy to understand and data with time series and information, the integration capability is the standard to construct 23 performance evaluation indicators. According to the type of indicators, the positive indicators, moderate indicators and negative indicators are standardized through the methods of maximization, averaging and minimization. The analytic hierarchy process is used to obtain the weight of each indicator. The weight value constructs the judgment matrix, and uses the Delphi method to set the standard interval of the evaluation result, thereby completing the construction of the performance evaluation system. The empirical results show that the constructed performance evaluation index system can effectively evaluate the performance results of a city's three-dimensional greening environment optimization, and the performance score is 79.46 points. This result is basically consistent with the actual operation of the city's current environmental performance, and has a certain practical significance.

AB  - The criteria to select submerged plant species for restoration still need further evaluations for a better understanding of their suitability prior to undertaking large plantings which represent a large effort in terms of economical and human resources. In this study, previously to the restoration of a eutrophic area (Tancat de la Pipa) within the Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, the growth of three submerged plants (Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum spicatum and Stuckenia pectinata), an amphibious species (Ranunculus sceleratus), and three charophytes species (Chara vulgaris, Tolypella glomerata and Nitella hyalina) has been evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions in order to rank their overall performance, based on their growth traits (total height reached, production of roots, etc.). The ranking was in the order of M. spicatum similar to S. pectinata > C. demersum and within the charophytes C. vulgaris > T. glomerata > N. hyalina. Moreover, considering the relationships of these species with other biotic factors (bird, fish and crayfish disturbance and herbivory) which can prevent the success of the revegetation, we propose starting the planting with M. spicatum, S. pectinata, R. sceleratus and C. vulgaris, which are available, are very easy to cultivate by vegetative reproduction from shoot tips and small specimens, have appropriate growth traits and certain degree of resistance to biotic factors. The other species (C. demersum, N. hyalina and T. glomerata) could be used subsequently once a suitable cover of submerged vegetation is settled in the area to enhance biodiversity, trying to reach the diversity which existed in the past in that area. Hence, the structural and functional complexity of the system under restoration might be achieved. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays, floods are occurring frequently around the world, and the Yangtze River Delta in China is one of the most vulnerable areas. This study used the Yangtze River Delta as the research object, established the flood disaster risk analysis model, calculated the indicator weights using the entropy weight method, and used three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods to compare and analyze the flood disaster risk in four administrative units of Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai City, Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, and Anhui Province). Based on the weight estimation results, vegetation coverage was the priority in all evaluation criteria, followed by the proportion of the illiterate population aged 15 and over, drainage density, proportion of crop sown area, and building density. The ranking results show that the flood disaster risk is highest in Jiangsu, followed by Anhui. Shanghai and Zhejiang ranked third and fourth, respectively. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the indicator weights was conducted considering that the ranking results mainly depend on the criteria weight. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the main factors influencing the flood disaster risk level in the Yangtze River Delta are agricultural factors, followed by population density, drainage density, and the number of medical and health institutions. Also, in terms of meteorological and geographical conditions, exposure, vulnerability, and disaster loss, Jiangsu has the highest flood disaster risk, while Anhui has the highest flood disaster risk in terms of emergency and recovery capabilities. The findings can provide useful information on disaster prevention and mitigation managers.

AB  - Despite the great importance of pharmaceutical products in our daily life, they have negative effects on the environment; where it may threatens many non-target organisms. The present study provides an integrated framework of contribution to understanding the toxicity of three commonly used pharmaceutical products (amoxicillin, naproxen and tramadol) on the micro-green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The impact of pharmaceutical pollution on aquatic organisms can be evaluated by assessing its physiological response. The alga was exposed to sub-lethal concentrations (LC10, LC25 and LC50) of each tested pharmaceutical to determine its impact on growth behavior, pigments, total lipids, protein and carbohydrate contents. The obtained results clarified that, exposure to the pharmaceuticals by their sub-lethal concentrations mostly resulted in a decrease in cell density up to 66.25% by amoxicillin and 37.24% by tramadol within LC50, although exposure to low naproxen concentration promoted cell density (up to 21.7%) after 24h. Amoxicillin (67.74 - 97.44%) followed by tramadol (59.67- 93.55%) significantly reduced the content of the pigment after 96h but in a different manner, however except within LC50, naproxen induced both carotenoids (4.55-11.61%) and chlorophyll-a (1.54 - 9.23%) during the first 24h. The tested pharmaceuticals also reducing protein, carbohydrates and total lipid content of P.subcapitata at the end of the experiment by ratios up to 96.7, 86.2 and 74.9% respectively. Due to the dramatic effects of pharmaceuticals on the aquatic non-target organisms all new pharmaceutical products must undergo an environmental risk assessment test during and after the development of the product to obtain marketing approval.

AB  - The aim of this brief research report was to define the consequential shifts in biomass and trophic structure of an ecosystem surrounding an offshore monoculture fish farm in Israel. It attempts to clarify the impact of the industry expansion and input of artificial fish pellets on functional group biomasses. We account for the direct addition of artificial food pellets, the metabolic wastes from the caged fish in a mass-balance food web model (Ecopath), as well as the temporal expansion of the farm's production capacity to 21,000 t over a 30-year period (Ecosim). In the static mass-balance model of the food web, the addition of the fish cages at its current production size of 1000 t does not adversely affect the system, and trophic energy transfer is still dependent on primary production versus the detrital pathway. The model suggests a semi-stable ecosystem with low trophic interactions. With time, the increase in fish farming at the site is characterized by an increase of all functional group biomasses at the site over the 30-year period. The accumulation in detritus most notably correlates to greater biomass for all benthic functional niches and their secondary consumers. It is, therefore, apt to develop an indicator species list to indicate negative site disturbance. In summary, the sediment column condition will be the main indicator for ecosystem stability, as well as the increase in apex predators that are attracted to the site from the accumulation of discards at the cage bottom.

AB  - There is a need for eco-social business models in the food waste sector that are more cascading and circularbased, while having economic, environmental and social benefits. The aim of this study is to bring insights and data of spent coffee grounds large-scale slow pyrolysis, to seize new opportunities for eco-innovative solutions in the circular economy, by identifying upcyding opportunities for resource recovery of this waste. First, an experimental study was conducted, and a set of pyrolysis experiments were carried out at a temperature range from 450 to 750 degrees C, with a heating rate of 50 degrees/s, under helium atmosphere, to explore the products' yields and the best process' conditions. Second, an economic study was conducted for a standalone pyrolysis plant fueled with the spent coffee grounds streams from coffee shops of a city with 150,000 inhabitants, in central Greece, aiming at the cost and the profitability of the endeavor estimation. The calculations were based on the features of a slow pyrolysis rotary kiln technology designed at Aristotle University, and co-developed with an Irish company, under the funding of an EU LIFE+ project. For an estimated capacity of 2566 t/yr of SCG, the revenue of the endeavor was calculated at 47(sic)/t of SCG. The economic indicators ROI and POT (ROI = 024, POT = 2.6), are very positive, suggesting pyrolysis of SCG as an efficient circular economy management solution, providing an ecosocial innovation business in the coflee shop industry, engaging also consumers in the circular economy.

AB  - Macroalgae are important components on coral reefs that underpin food webs but are also indicators of declines in coral reef condition. The sensitivity of macroalgal communities to environmental factors, including climate and pollutants from the land, is important for the future state of coral reefs. We assessed regional variation in the photosynthetic physiology of macroalgae on the Great Barrier Reef and Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, using delta C-13, tissue chemistry, and metabolic indicators over broad environmental gradients from six sites spanning 13 degrees of latitude and varying distance from shore. Our data set included 568 samples from 54 genera and 19 macroalgal orders. The delta C-13 of tissues had a strong taxonomic basis (explaining 66% of the variation in delta C-13), varying significantly among algal orders. Particularly low values of delta C-13, indicating direct use of CO2(aq) in photosynthesis, were mainly associated with lineages within the Rhodophyta. We observed declines in delta C-13 with increasing depth (inshore only) and latitude, from offshore to inshore sites and with increasing tissue N and N : P ratio. Variation in delta C-13 of tissues among macroalgal lineages suggests evolution of a range of CO2 acquisition pathways. Patterns in delta C-13 availability are most consistent with higher availability of CO2(aq) in cooler water and inshore sites. delta C-13 in macroalgae could provide an important tool for monitoring changes in CO2(aq) with increasing atmospheric CO2, with changes in ocean circulation and with changes to runoff from the land to the coastal oceans.

AB  - Although in contemporary documentation 1506-1507 is the best-documented drought event in the medieval and sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Carpathian Basin, until now no investigations have been carried out on this subject. Based on contemporary sources-such as narratives, charters, official and private correspondence, estate, town, county and taxation accounts-a concise overview of the documented natural-physical characteristics, temporal-spatial distribution of the drought event and related weather extremes is provided. In a European context, the present investigation reveals that 1506 was a dry year not only in the Carpathian Basin but also in most of Europe. Drought continued in the Carpathian Basin and Italy in 1507, while opposing weather patterns developed in West-Central, Western and Northern Europe, showing similarities to the 2007 and 2015 summer heat and drought events. In the Carpathian Basin, the drought was characterized by the critical low water levels of the River Tisza, heat and high-intensity convective events. Major socio-economic consequences were the higher occurrence rate of major urban fires, bad harvests (cereals, grapevine/wine, hay) and livestock problems (lack or loss of bee, bee products, sheep, cattle, fish, fur)-the latter ones might serve as indicators for future studies. The drought induced numerous individual and institutional responses, including various types of tax relief and common works. The ensuing plague epidemic reached a particularly high level in Hungary; the drought, bad harvests, a change to cooler and wetter conditions, and nutrition problems could have contributed to the intensification of the epidemic outbreak in 1508-1511.

AB  - Ojcow birch (Betula oycoviensis Besser) is a rare and critically endangered taxon of the genus Betula. Its distribution is limited to few countries in Europe. In the Czech Republic, this taxon, characterized by typical shrubby habitus, has been found in fewer than 70 tree individuals, prevailingly in the studied locality Volyne, West Bohemia. This study was focused on the germinative capacity and germinative energy of this taxon, as it is an important indicator of possible regeneration of the trees in nature and for conservation. Non-stratified seeds (2 200 pcs) and stratified ones (2 200 pcs) were compared to each other and in relation to dendrometric tree parameters. The results showed no significant (P > 0.1) differences between stratification variants in total germination (higher by 0.8% in stratified), though stratification improved germinative energy. Germination was in 1st week higher by 6.0% in stratified variant, respectively marginally (P < 0.1) higher in 2nd week in non-stratified variant. However, both germinative capacity and germinative energy were significantly (P < 0.01) variable between individual trees. The germinative capacity was significantly (P < 0.05) positively correlated with tree defoliation. Tiny seeds and triploid trees exhibited very low and zero germinative capacity and energy, respectively. Totally, seeds exhibited sufficient germinative capacity and germinative energy of 23.1% (0.0-62.5%). This suggests that the trees can be potentially used for this type of Ojcow birch regeneration i.e. generatively from seeds, although rather in controlled artificial conditions.

AB  - Fusarium verticillioides is the primary fungus that causes Fusarium ear rot (FER) of maize. Infection results in reduced grain yield and quality due to moulding and the contamination of grain with toxic compounds namely fumonisins. Resistance to fungal infection and fumonisin accumulation in maize and maize grain is governed at different levels. In this study, the structural, physico-chemical and genetic basis of resistance to F. verticillioides was investigated in two, replicated field trials at Potchefstroom and Vaalharts in South Africa. Phenotypic data (silk length, husk coverage, pericarp thickness hundred-kernel mass and kernel hardness), physico-chemical data (kernel pH, moisture content, total nitrogen and carbon as well as phenolic acid content) and the expression of pathogenesis-related-5 gene (PRS) and peroxidase gene expression was evaluated in 15 commercial cultivars under artificially inoculated and natural infection conditions. The data were correlated to FER severity, fumonisin accumulation and fungal DNA (referred to as infection indicators). Disease development and fumonisin contamination in Vaalharts was significantly more than in Potchefstroom. There were no significant correlations (r=>= 0.60) between phenotypic characteristics and infection indicators. Kernel pH was the most important trait associated with disease development and was negatively correlated (between r=-0.58 and r=-0.75) to all infection indicators. PRS gene expression had significant positive correlations (r=0.69 and r=0.72) with the fungal and fumonisin levels, respectively. This study presents of the first data demonstrating the use of gene expression in identifying FER/fumonisin-resistant plant material and could aid breeders and growers in selecting resistant material more effectively.

AB  - This study aimed at analyzing the diversity and ecological characteristics of forest associations (121 releves classified under eight associations) in Ktire Mountains National Park. Ordination analyses (DCA and CCA) and response curves were used to reveal ecological characteristics of vegetation using soil parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, sand, clay and dust content, soil moisture) and topographical variables (altitude, slope, potential direct incident radiation and heat load). Ecological conditions of communities were also tested using average Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs). Among forest associations, the highest species diversity was found in Phillyreo latifoliae-Pinetum brutiae and the lowest diversity in Hedero-Castanetum sativae, which had a dense Rhododendron ponticum shrub layer. However, Salicio-Platanet um orientale and Buxo sempervirens-Ccupinetum betuli had the highest beta diversity since they harbored unique species composition. Conditional effects of altitude, slope, pH and electrical conductivity, soil dust and sand content, sandy-loam and loam soil types presented significant contributions in species composition. While Carpino-Querretum petraeae was found on soil with high dust content having high pH and electrical conductivity values, Quercetum roburi-Aceretum campestri and Salicio-Platanettun orientale were related to soil with loam. Species responses to soil and topographical variables varied for most tree species. Light EIVs, which has a high positive correlation with potential direct incident radiation and heat load, related to Phillyreo latifoliae-Pinetum brutiae and Salicio-Platanetum orientale. Riverside forest communities diffixed from other communities in nutrient and humidity EIVs. However, EIVs did not show a good correlation with associated soil parameters such as soil moisture-humidity EIVs and soil pH-acidity EIVs.

AB  - Mob stocking is a type of livestock management method where high densities of animals are restricted to a small area of grassland for short periods of time (e.g., 12-24 hr.) before being moved to new forage. Use of mob stocking has generated considerable interest among forage-livestock professionals in recent years, but questions remain about its purported benefits to cattle and forage plants. To address questions about the possible benefits of mob stocking, a 3-yr study (2014-2016) was conducted in Virginia, USA comparing mob, rotational, and continuous stocking methods in a temperate grassland common to that region. The main objective of this study was to evaluate how mob-stocking management affected selected forage variables, cattle performance, and legume/weed abundance. Herbage mass and nutritive value were measured monthly. Cow and calf weights and body condition score (BCS) were used as indicators of animal performance. Legumes (red and white clover) were over-seeded prior to the study, and their abundance along with weeds were evaluated annually thereafter. Mean herbage mass and forage nutritive values were similar across mob, rotational and continuously stocked systems despite extra-long rest periods that allowed grasses to grow tall and over-mature under mob stocking. Cow weights going into winter were lower (P < 0.05) under mob stocking (619 kg) compared with continuous stocking (688 kg) possibly because many tall grasses were trampled and not grazed. Lastly, we found mob stocking can favor establishment of erect-growing red clover (Trifolium pretense L.), but it had no effect on weed abundance. Overall, we found few compelling reasons why mob stocking should be adopted for season-long forage and livestock production over other stocking methods in this environment.

AB  - Hydrocarbon polar metabolites are gaining interest from industry and the remediation community due to their ubiquity and uncertainty around their toxicity. In this study, we used headspace-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) to characterize polar metabolites present in elutriates derived from uncontaminated, freshly hydrocarbon contaminated and partially remediated Antarctic soils. Elutriates represent the bioavailable fraction and may be used as a proxy for leachate runoff in environmental risk assessments. Control and contaminated soil elutriates were analysed for the presence of 12 aldehydes and two ketones, which cover a broad spectrum of metabolites, ranging from nC2 - nC12 carbon chain length. A total of nine aldehydes were detected in the soil elutriates. Types of aldehydes present in uncontaminated and hydrocarbon contaminated elutriates were similar. Among the polar metabolites measured in elutriates, acetaldehyde was most abundant in partially remediated soils. Microtox assays were used to determine the potential toxicity of elutriates. In addition, three aldehydes that were present at the highest concentrations in the contaminated and partially remediated soil elutriates (acetaldehyde, octanal and undecanal) were tested as single compounds. Contaminated soil elutriates tested were found to be toxic, with partially remediated elutriates less toxic than freshly contaminated elutriates. None of the three aldehydes tested separately were toxic at levels at which they were measured in elutriates. We infer that high levels of acetaldehyde in partially remediated soil due to hydrocarbon degradation highlight the potential of this metabolite as a useful chemical marker for hydrocarbon degradation under certain conditions. Microtox was sensitive to metabolites and provided a useful initial screening tool for elutriates. Crown Copyright 2019 Published by Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we provide new data about the soil enzyme activity as a biological process, which is an indicator for impacts of factorial combinations of lime and fertilizers applications. Five plots divided into fifteen subplots were sampled for determination of the enzymatic indicators of soil quality, based on the actual and potential dehydrogenase and catalase activities. The research revealed that limed soil samples, in comparison with unlimed ones, resulted in significantly higher soil enzymatic activities (p<0.05) in the upper (0-20 cm), while in the deeper (20-40 cm) layer, only catalase activity was significantly higher (at least at p<0.02). Mineral fertilization, in comparison with its farmyard manuring, led to an insignificant increase in each of the three enzymatic activities determined, excepting catalase activity which was significantly higher (0.05>p>0.02) in the 0-20 cm layer. Based on the absolute values of the enzymatic activities, the enzymatic indicators of soil quality (EISQ) were calculated. The mineral NPK-fertilization and low dose of lime in the 0-20 cm layer, and mineral NP-fertilization and low dose of lime in the 20-40 cm layer proved to be the best variants of fertilization. The enzymatic indicators of soil quality in these variants reached the highest values: EISQ=0.821 and EISQ=0.889, respectively, indicating the presence of high enzymatic activities. It should be emphasized that a balanced application of lime, mineral fertilizers and farmyard manure leads to the formation of favorable conditions for the development of microorganisms, growth of plants and for an intense and lasting enzymatic activity.

AB  - Fire is a major disturbance agent in the boreal forest, influencing many current and future ecosystem conditions and services. Surprisingly few studies have attempted to improve the accuracy of fire-event reconstructions even though the estimates of the occurrence of past fires may be biased, influencing the reliability of the models employing those data (e.g. C stock, cycle). This study aimed to demonstrate how three types of fire proxies - fire scars from tree rings, sedimentary charcoal and, for the first time in this context, fungal spores of Neurospora - can be integrated to achieve a better understanding of past fire dynamics. By studying charcoal and Neurospora from sediment cores from forest hollows, and the fire scars from tree rings in their surroundings in the southern Fennoscandian and western Russian boreal forest, we produced composite fire-event data sets and fire-event frequencies, and estimated fire return intervals. Our estimates show that the fire return interval varied between 126 and 237 years during the last 11,000 years. The highest fire frequency during the 18th-19th century can be associated with the anthropogenic influence. Importantly, statistical tests revealed a positive relationship between other fire event indicators and Neurospora occurrence allowing us to pinpoint past fire events at times when the sedimentary charcoal was absent, but Neurospora were abundant. We demonstrated how fire proxies with different temporal resolution can be linked, providing potential improvements in the reliability of fire history reconstructions from multiple proxies.

AB  - In recent years, scientific investigations on the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PM) in conserving biodiversity and sustaining ecosystem functions under the impact of climate change have increasingly received more attention from researchers and park managers. In this study, we used a combination of species distribution modelling (SDM) and spatial hierarchical systematic conservation planning technique to delineate and prioritize areas for endemic plant species conservation under current and future (2050s, 2070s) climate conditions in Sikkim Himalaya. Data on endemic plant species occurrence were sourced from our already published studies and their potential suitable habitats under current and future climates were modelled using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) SDM. The MaxEnt habitat suitability projections of species were used in Zonation software to identify priority conservation areas in Sikkim Himalaya. We found that the existing PA network in the region was inadequate in conserving the endemic plant diversity either in the current or future climate scenarios. Based on our results, we propose addition of 896 square kilometres (sq km) to the existing PA network in the study area to ensure meaningful conservation goals. Additionally, we propose creation of 3 new PM (Yumsedong, Lachen and Chungthang) and the need for expanding the boundaries of existing PM (Maenam, Fambong Lho and Barsey) in the study area. Our analyses show that to mitigate the effects of ensuing climate change, a single large PA with wide geographic and elevational extents instead of several smaller PM would be a more prudent strategy for conserving the plant diversity in the Himalaya.

AB  - There is high demand for identifying socio-environmentally sound ways to dispose of large quantities of offensive odor-enerating organic residues produced by intensive livestock farming. The use of these residues as amendments at large-scale mine tailings storage facilities for in situ plant-based reclamation may be a useful alternative. We performed a greenhouse assay to evaluate effectiveness of pig slurries and the solid organic fraction of aerobic-aerated pig slurries, both treated and not treated for odor emission, as amendments for copper tailings. Different doses of slurries or the solid organic fraction of the slurries, untreated and treated with either ozone or a commercial product used to manage strong odors (Just a Drop), were incorporated into tailings and stabilized (15 d) under greenhouse conditions. Lolium perenne L. (ryegrass) was used as bioindicator for Cu and Zn toxicity. Plant performance (shoot and root dry biomass, Cu and Zn content in leaves) and general physicochemical characteristics of substrates were evaluated. Our results showed that odor management of pig residues was possible with commercial products, and their incorporation into tailings rapidly and effectively reduced odor emission. The solid organic fraction of the slurries neutralized acidic tailings, and both pig residues increased organic matter and nutrient content in tailings while reducing extractable Cu. As a result, ryegrass productivity was significantly improved by incorporation of either slurries or their solid organic fraction into tailings in a dose-dependent form. Foliar Cu content in ryegrass was not affected but foliar Zn content increased; however, Zn remained within acceptable ranges. Both the pig slurries and their soil organic fractions proved to be valuable residues for tailings reclamation.

AB  - Rootstock grafting can improve the cold tolerance of watermelon. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. Herein, we used an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics approach for the comparative analysis of protein abundances in self-grafted (SG) and pumpkin rootstock-grafted (RG) watermelon seedlings in response to cold stress. A total of 4796 distinct proteins were identified, and 752 proteins were significantly differentially accumulated in grafted watermelon seedling leaves after 48 h cold stress. Based on bioinformatics analysis, the cold tolerance of RG watermelon seedlings might be related to more energy produced through photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation, compared with that of SG watermelon seedlings. RG watermelon seedlings could cope with cold stress by improving the scavenging capacity of ROS and arginine biosynthesis. Posttranscriptional regulation and protein homeostasis also play important roles for grafted watermelon seedlings to adapt to cold stress. Several protein kinases involved in signal transduction may act as positive regulators in RG watermelon seedling leaves suffering from cold stress. In addition, iTRAQ data were confirmed to be reliable by the assays of physiological indicators and relative transcript levels of eight genes.
   Biological significance: Rootstock grafting is regarded as an effective method to enhance the cold tolerance of watermelon seedlings. To elucidate the cold tolerance mechanism of grafted watermelon, an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach combined with bioinformatics analysis was employed to identify differentially accumulated proteins in SG and RG watermelon seedlings between cold stress and control conditions. This study provided additional insight into the molecular basis of the grafted watermelon seedlings in response to cold stress.

AB  - The Yellow River flow has decreased substantially in recent decades, and the river often dried up in the lower reach and failed to reach the sea. Climate change and human disruption have been suggested as major causes of the flow reduction, but quantification of their relative contribution is challenging due to limited instrumental records and disturbance by dams. Here we use a basin-wide tree ring network to reconstruct the Yellow River flow for the past 1,200 years and show that the flow exhibits marked amplitude variations that are closely coupled to the hydrological mean state swings at multidecadal to centennial timescales. Recent flow should have increased to the highest level of the past 1,200 years if there were no human disruption. However, human activities have caused a loss of nearly half of natural flow since the late 1960s and are the main culprit for recent downstream flow reduction.
   Plain Language Summary Recent Yellow River flow reductions have had major impacts on China's economy and water policy. The short and heavily human-modified gauge records are unable to reveal natural flow variability now and in the past. Here we use tree rings to reconstruct long-term Yellow River flow, which enables an assessment of natural flow variability and the detection of human contributions to recent flow reductions. Our 1,200-year reconstruction reveals that under natural conditions the Yellow River flow should have increased markedly since the early twentieth century. However, the observed flow decreased since the late 1960s and such a decrease must be predominately caused by human interventions instead of climate change.

AB  - We examined late Holocene (ca. 3300 yr BP to present-day) climate variability in the central Northwest Territories (Canadian Subarctic) using a diatom and sedimentological record from Danny's Lake (63.48 degrees N, 112.54 degrees W), located 40 km southwest of the modern-day tree-line. High-resolution sampling paired with a robust age model (25 radiocarbon dates) allowed for the examination of both lake hydroecological conditions (30-year intervals; diatoms) and sedimentological changes in the watershed (12-year intervals; grain size records) over the late Holocene. Time series analysis of key lake ecological indicators (diatom species Aulacoseira alpigena, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata and Achnanthidium minutissimum) and sedimentological parameters, reflective of catchment processes (coarse silt fraction), suggests significant intermittent variations in turbidity, pH and light penetration within the lake basin. In the diatom record, we observed discontinuous periodicities in the range of ca. 69, 88-100, 115-132, 141-188, 562, 750 and 900 years (>90% and >95% confidence intervals), whereas the coarse silt fraction was characterized by periodicities in the >901 and <61-year range (>95% confidence interval). Periodicities in the proxy data from the Danny's Lake sediment core align with changes in total solar irradiance over the past ca. 3300 yr BP and we hypothesize a link to the Suess Cycle, Gleissberg Cycle and Pacific Decadal Oscillation via occasional inland propagation of shifting air masses over the Pacific Ocean. This research represents an important baseline study of the underlying causes of climate variability in the Canadian Subarctic and provides details on the long-term climate variability that has persisted in this region through the past three thousand years.

AB  - Spectral gamma-ray tools present the concentrations of the three radioactive elements responsible for the natural gamma radiation, which are thorium (Th), uranium (U), and potassium (K), separately. This separation can be interpreted geochemically and geologically to identify some formation characteristics, such as lithologies, clay types, fractures, unconformities, and hydrocarbon potentialities. In this study, the geochemical and geological contributions of the natural spectral gamma-ray spectrometry (NGS) log were interpreted to characterize the Rudeis Formation in well Amal-9, Amal field, the southern province of the Gulf of Suez, Egypt. The interpretation was supported by other logging tools, cuttings description, and Rock-Eval pyrolysis. The study revealed that reducing conditions were predominant during the deposition of most of the stratigraphic sequence of the Rudeis Formation. The sediments of the Rudeis Formation were identified into four lithofacies; each one has its own diagnostic spectral gamma radiation. The lithofacies are composed of sandstone (lowest radiation), limestone, shale, and marl (highest radiation). The U content can be considered as the main contributor to the radioactivity of the Rudeis Formation. Furthermore, there is a relationship between the U and the TOC contents, implying that U can be used as a proxy for organic richness shale and as an indicator for good source rock intervals in this formation. As indicated from several crossplots, the clay minerals are mainly represented by montmorillonite with a low percentage of kaolinite and illite. Several unconformities were detected, based on the dipmeter data and observing the abrupt change in both the Th/K ratio and U curves.

AB  - Mixed millet and rice agriculture is a unique agricultural style of China, and is distributed in a broad band between the Yangtze and Yellow River basin. However, the development of this style during the Neolithic-Bronze Age has not been comprehensively clarified, owing to limited archaeobotanical data and imprecise chronology for most of the regions. Here, the Central Plain, a location where mixed agriculture may have first appeared, was selected as the area for research. Phytolith and macrofossil analyses from the Zhuzhai site, together with the accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dating of samples, reveal information about the temporal changes of mixed agriculture as well as the domestication and cultivation of crops in this region. The results indicate that mixed millet and rice agriculture formed in the Central Plain about 8000 years ago. Common millet was the principal crop in the Peiligang and Yangshao periods, with the domestication process beginning in the Peiligang period and continuing up to the Shang period, at which time it was replaced by foxtail millet. Foxtail millet may have gone through a significant degree of domestication by ca. 6000 cal. BC, but its domestication process was still unclear. Rice had appeared since the Peiligang period, but its proportions were always low. Rice assigned to the Peiligang and Yangshao Cultures was the domesticated japonica, and its cultivation was always performed in dry field systems through the Neolithic-Bronze time. Within the subsistence economy, mixed agriculture was a minor component during the Peiligang period, but has been dominant since the Yangshao period.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion can inactivate zoonotic pathogens present in cattle manure, which reduces transmission of these pathogens from farms to humans through the environment. However, the variability of inactivation across farms and over time is unknown because most studies have examined pathogen inactivation under ideal laboratory conditions or have focused on only one or two full-scale digesters at a time. In contrast, we sampled seven full-scale digesters treating cattle manure in Wisconsin for 9 mo on a biweekly basis (n = 118 pairs of influent and effluent samples) and used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze these samples for 19 different microbial genetic markers. Overall, inactivation of pathogens and fecal indicators was highly variable. When aggregated across digester and season, log-removal values for several representative microorganisms-bovine Bacteroides, Bacteroidales-like CowM3, and bovine polyomavirus-were 0.78 +/- 0.34, 0.70 +/- 0.50, and 0.53 +/- 0.58, respectively (mean +/- SD). These log-removal values were up to two times lower than expected based on the scientific literature. Thus, our study indicates that full-scale anaerobic digestion of cattle manure requires optimization with regard to pathogen inactivation. Future studies should focus on identifying the potential causes of this suboptimal performance (e.g., overloading, poor mixing, poor temperature control). Our study also examined the fate of pathogens during manure separation and found that the majority of microbes we detected ended up in the liquid fraction of separated manure. This finding has important implications for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens through the environment to humans.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to examine differences in having preventable emergency department (ED) visits between noncitizens, naturalized and US-born citizens in the United States.
   Methods: We linked the 2008-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey with National Health Interview Survey data to draw a nationally representative sample of US adults. Univariate analysis described distribution of preventable ED visits identified by the Prevention Quality Indicators across immigration status. We also assessed the association between preventable ED visits and immigration status, controlling for demographics, socioeconomic status, health service utilization, and health status. We finally applied the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method to measure the contribution of each covariate to differences in preventable ED services utilization between US natives, naturalized citizens, and noncitizens.
   Results: Of US natives, 2.1% had any preventable ED visits within the past years as compared to 1.0% of noncitizens and 1.5% of naturalized citizens. Multivariate results also revealed that immigrants groups had significantly lower odds (adjusted OR: naturalized citizen 0.77 [0.61-0.96], noncitizen 0.62 [0.48-0.80]) of having preventable ED visits than natives. Further stratified analysis by insurance status showed these differences were only significant among the uninsured and public insurance groups. Race/ethnicity and health insurance explained about 68% of the difference in preventable ED service utilization between natives and noncitizens.
   Conclusion: Our study documents the existing differences in preventable ED visits across immigration status, and highlights the necessity to explore unmet health needs among immigrants and eliminate disparities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The last decade has seen a steady rise in the number of publications on nitrogen isotopes in sedimentary rocks, which have become an established tool for investigating the evolution of life and environmental conditions. Nitrogen is contained in sedimentary rocks in two different phases: bound to kerogen or substituted in potassic minerals (mostly K-bearing phyllosilicates and feldspars). Isotopic measurements and interpretations typically focus either on kerogen extracts alone or on bulk rocks that include both phases. The community is split about which sample type more accurately captures the original composition of biomass. To address this question, we combined nitrogen isotopes and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios with carbon-to-hydrogen ratios, which act as an independent proxy for metamorphic alteration. Our results reveal that metamorphism drives kerogen-bound nitrogen isotopically lighter while silicate-bound nitrogen becomes heavier. For rocks up to greenschist facies, the isotopic effect of this internal partitioning (up to 3-4 parts per thousand) is larger than the isotopic effect of metamorphic nitrogen loss from the system (up to 1-2 parts per thousand). The opposite may be true for higher metamorphic grades. We conclude that for low-grade sedimentary rocks with more than 60% of their total nitrogen residing in the silicate phase the primary isotopic composition of the biomass is best approximated by bulk rock measurements, whereas for high-grade rocks the kerogen extract may be the more accurate proxy. The isotopic difference between nitrogen phases can serve as a rough indicator of the degree of metamorphic alteration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban morphology information is an important indicator in urban planning, information management, and urban climatic applications. However, the problem of urban morphological data harmonization, quality, and availability are well-known, especially in developing countries. In this study, a novel satellite-based approach was proposed to extract 3D urban morphology information, and then retrieve and validate typical urban morphological parameters for urban climatic applications. Some most widely used urban morphological parameters building coverage ratio (BCR), building height (BH), building volume density (BVD), frontal area index (FM), sky view factor (SVF), and roughness length (RL)-were calculated and validated. Experiments conducted throughout the entire urban environment of Kowloon Peninsula, the most complex and high-density urban area in Hong Kong, demonstrated that all of the retrieved parameters had a high prediction accuracy, compared with the actual data at spatial resolutions of hundreds of meters. In particular, the prediction accuracy of BCR, BH, BVD, and RL was 70-80% while the accuracy of SVF and FAI was 80-90%. This set of urban morphological data is employed to generate a Hong Kong Urban Climatic Map. As an extension of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) method to provide 2D urban form data for cities worldwide, this newly developed method can quickly and efficiently produce highly accurate 3D urban morphology data for cities where actual urban morphology data are not accessible. This study also expands spatial understanding of urban climatic conditions in a fast and efficient way, enabling urban climatic application in urban planning for sustainable urban living.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a toolset that can be used by site managers to assess and monitor natural attenuation processes in sediments contaminated with legacy hydrophobic organic contaminants. The toolset is composed of sediment traps to measure quality and deposition rate of incoming sediment under different hydrodynamic conditions, sediment cores to show trends in sediment bed concentrations over time, and passive samplers attached to a porewater probe frame to assess the mobility of buried contaminants and possible contaminant flux from sediment. These three tools were used together for the first time to assess the mobility of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contaminants in sediment in Pallanza Bay, Lake Maggiore, Italy. Depositing sediment and sediment cores were consistent in showing that DDT-contaminated sediment is undergoing burial by cleaner sediment. Elevated DDT concentrations from historical contamination seemed to be effectively buried and immobilized by ongoing deposition by cleaner sediment, because the positive flux from the elevated DDT concentration in the sediment porewater should not advance towards the sediment surface. The monitoring toolset introduced in this study enabled us to more effectively assess ongoing natural attenuation processes and provide more risk relevant data than traditional methods used in monitored natural recovery projects, such as bulk sediment concentrations from sediment cores. Our field assessment results suggest that incoming sediment from the Toce River have reduced DDT concentrations in the sediment compared to historic levels, and will continue to do so in locations where higher DDT concentrations are found within the bioactive layer.

AB  - Cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) is widely grown due to its winter hardiness and adaptability to varied soil and environmental conditions. Fall and spring climate and available soil N drive biomass production. However, there is limited empirical information on the effects of these factors on cover crop performance. Farmers need early spring indicators of cereal rye performance to guide management. A 3-yr experiment was initiated to test and model the effects of climate and soil N fertility on cereal rye growth and allometric relationships in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and North Carolina under five-six fall fertilizer rates. We hypothesized that allometric relationships between early spring growth indicators can guide management decisions. Measurements included tillering, biomass, tissue N, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at Zadoks growth stages (GS) 25, 30, and 60. Nitrogen application increased biomass: maximum average biomass was 2853, 4844, and 9739 kg ha(-1), respectively, at GS25, GS30, and GS60. At GS25, biomass accounted for the greatest amount of model variation and better predicted GS60 biomass than shoot density and NDVI. Variance attributed solely to GS25 and GS30 biomass constituted 38.5 to 65.2% of total model variance. Models accurately predicted biomass and N accumulation 34 to 60% of the time. This study illustrates the difficulty in predicting late season biomass and N content based on early measurements. One extension of this research would be the development of a simple protocol to accurately sample cereal rye biomass at GS25 to estimate potential N accumulation and biomass at GS60.

AB  - Recent soil tests evaluating "soil health" on a broad scale may not properly consider the intrinsic limitations of soil properties, and have not been assessed in regionally unique soil conditions. To evaluate three soil tests in North Carolina, we used long-term agronomic management trials from three distinct physiographic regions: mountain (22 yr), piedmont (32 yr), and coastal plain (17 yr). Mountain and coastal plain trials included combinations of organic or chemical management with or without tillage; the piedmont trial included nine different tillage treatments. Soil samples were collected and submitted for analysis as recommended by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Haney soil health test (HSHT), and Cornell comprehensive assessment of soil health (CASH). Plant nutrient concentrations varied but were still sufficient for crops. The CASH physical soil indicators, such as surface hardness and aggregate stability, were not statistically different, regardless of tillage intensity or management. Biological soil indicators (e.g., CO2 respiration) responded differently to management, but this differentiation was inconsistent among locations and tests. Despite many years of conservation management, the CASH results described mountain soils as "low" or "very low" soil health for all but no-till organic management, which received a "medium" score. The HSHT results considered soil from all but moldboard plowing (piedmont) to be in good health. Finally, there was no correlation between soil health tests and crop yields from North Carolina soils. Soil health tests should be calibrated to better differentiate among soil management effects that vary depending on intrinsic soil limitations.

AB  - At present, nanoscale materials have been produced with unprecedented speed due to their widespread use and may inevitably be released into the environment. As an effective adsorbent for heavy metals, nanoscale carbon black (CB) can be used to immobilize metals in contaminated soil, but no information is available regarding its effect on soil nematodes. In the present study, laboratory bioassays were performed to investigate the impact of three rates (1%, 3%, and 5% mass ratios) of HNO3 or H2SO4 modified nanoscale carbon black (NCB or SCB) on the abundance and composition of nematode communities during 120 d of turfgrass growth. The results showed that 5% NCB and SCB treatments significantly increased plant shoot biomass of two crops. The total number of nematode genera in the control was greater than in nano-CB treatments. Plant parasites dominated across all treatments, with dominant genus Helicotylenchus. The abundance of total nematodes and each of the four trophic groups responded negatively to nano-CB addition. Three percent and 5% NCB addition significantly decreased the abundance of total nematodes, plant parasitic and bacterivorous nematodes, compared to the control. The species diversity, richness, community evenness and maturity index of soil nematodes were significantly decreased by 3% and 5% nano-CB compared to the control. This study revealed that modified nano-CB, as an amendment with a rate of 3% or higher, could cause significant disturbance to the soil food web and thus affect soil nematodes in the short-term.

AB  - Transplastomic plants are capable of high-yield production of recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins. Plant tissue culture combines advantages of agricultural cultivation with the bioprocess consistency associated with suspension culture. Overexpression of recombinant proteins through regeneration of transplastomic Nicotiana tabacum shoots from callus tissue in RITA temporary immersion bioreactors has been previously demonstrated. In this study we investigated the hydrodynamics of periodic pneumatic suspension of liquid medium during temporary immersion culture (4 min aeration every 8 h), and the impact on biological responses and transplastomic expression of fragment C of tetanus toxin (TetC). Biomass was grown under a range of aeration rates for 3, 20 and 40-day durations. Growth, mitochondrial activity (a viability indicator) and TetC protein yields were correlated against the hydrodynamic parameters, shear rate and energy dissipation rate (per kg of medium). A critical aeration rate of 440 ml min(-1) was identified, corresponding to a shear rate of 96.7 s(-1), pneumatic power input of 8.8 mW kg(-1) and initial 20-day pneumatic energy dissipation of 127 J kg(-1), at which significant reductions in biomass accumulation and mitochondrial activity were observed. There was an exponential decline in TetC yields with increasing aeration rates at 40 days, across the entire range of conditions tested. These observations have important implications for the optimisation and scale-up of transplastomic plant tissue culture bioprocesses for biopharmaceutical production. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Vitis vinifera L. cv. Crimson Seedless is a late season red table grape developed in 1989, with a high market value and increasingly cultivated under protected environments to extend the availability of seedless table grapes into the late fall. The purpose of this work was to evaluate leaf water potential and sap flow as indicators of water stress in Crimson Seedless vines under standard and reduced irrigation strategy, consisting of 70 % of the standard irrigation depth. Additionally, two sub-treatments were applied, consisting of normal irrigation throughout the growing season and a short irrigation induced stress period between veraison and harvest. Leaf water potential measurements coherently signaled crop-available water variations caused by different irrigation treatments, suggesting that this plant-based method can be reliably used to identify water-stress conditions. The use of sap flow density data to establish a ratio based on a reference 'well irrigated vine' and less irrigated vines can potentially be used to signal differences in the transpiration rates, which may be suitable for improving irrigation management strategies while preventing undesirable levels of water stress. Although all four irrigation strategies resulted in the production of quality table grapes, significant differences (p <= 0.05) were found in both berry weight and sugar content between the standard irrigation and reduced irrigation treatments. Reduced irrigation increased slightly the average berry size as well as sugar content and technical maturity index. The 2-week irrigation stress period had a negative effect on these parameters.

AB  - Introduction: Experiences of clinical and nonclinical learning environments, as well as assessment and study environments influence student satisfaction with their medical schools. Student-tutor ratios may impact on their perception of clinical learning environments. The aim of this study was to analyze medical students' satisfaction and student-tutor ratios in relation to medical schools' number of admissions.
   Material and Methods: A questionnaire was created, regarding learning, assessment and study environments in eight medical schools. 2037 students participated in this cross-sectional study. Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency) was calculated and principal component analysis was conducted. Pearson correlations and multiple comparisons were analyzed.
   Results: Assessment environments showed the highest satisfaction scores and clinical learning environments the lowest scores. The national student-tutor ratio in clinical rotations is 7.53; there are significant differences among schools. Institutions with higher number of admissions showed the lowest scores of overall student satisfaction (r = -0.756; p < 0.05), which decreased with progression in the medical course. High student-tutor ratios are strongly correlated with low levels of satisfaction regarding clinical learning environments (r = -0.826; p < 0.05).
   Discussion: Clinical learning environments show the lowest satisfaction scores, which may expose the effect of high ratios in clinical rotations. Depending on the number of admissions, significant differences between medical schools were found. Quality of teaching-learning strategies and articulation with hospitals might also be important variables.
   Conclusion: Medical schools with more admissions might be more susceptible to lower scores of student satisfaction. High student-tutor ratios in clinical rotations may reduce the quality of learning experiences and inhibit the acquisition of competences.

AB  - Reliable condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is an important issue for the normal operation of coal cutter gear systems. Intrinsic deterioration indicators are always hidden in the vibration response of the gearboxes, and it is often very difficult to correctly extract them due to nonlinear/chaotic nature of the vibration signal. Literature review suggests that hybrid gear faults diagnosis is a challenging task and how to extract quantitative indicators for hybrid faults detection is attracting considerable attentions. In order to address this issue, a new adaptive nonstationary vibration analysis method is proposed in this paper to extract useful quantitative indicators for hybrid gear faults decoupling detection. In this new technology, the center frequencies of the narrow bands of intrinsic modes contained in the vibration signal were adaptively estimated by the variational model decomposition (VMD) to determine the bandwidth of the modes. Hence, the hybrid gear faults were decoupled into single faults in the form of VMD modes. Then, the time and frequency features of each mode were calculated to obtain the feature space. Lastly, the feature space was projected into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space by the spectral regression-optimized kernel Fisher discrimination (SRKFD), where the instinct nonlinear structure in the original data can be identified and thus useful quantitative indicators can be extracted. Reliable hybrid faults decoupling detection was then achieved. Specially designed numerical simulations and experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed VMD-SRKFD method on hybrid gear faults diagnosis of coal cutters. The performance was compared with existing techniques. The analysis results show high performance of the proposed method on quantitative hybrid faults detection in the coal cutter gear system.

AB  - An environmental impact assessment of a landfarming process, which was performed at an actual petroleum-contaminated site, was conducted using a green and sustainable remediation (GSR) tool in this study. The landfarming process was divided into four stages: site preparation, installation, system operation, and system dismantling/waste disposal. The environmental footprints of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water consumption, total energy usage, and air pollutants (SOx. NOx, and PM10) were analyzed. GHG emissions and water consumption were approximately 276 metric tons and 7.90E+05 gal, respectively, in stage III, where they were the highest due to the consumables and equipment use in the system operation. Total energy usage had the highest value of 1.54E+03 MMBTU in stage II due to material production. The SO, and NO, emissions primarily occurred in stages 1 and II due to energy usage. The PM10 was mostly emitted in stages 1 and 111 and was associated with heavy use of equipment. To reduce the environmental footprints, biodiesel and sunlight were suggested as alternatives in this study. The GHG and SOx emissions decreased to 1.7 and 4.4E-04 metric tons, respectively, on the basis of total emissions with a 1 % increase in biodiesel content, but the NOx emissions increased to 5.6E-03 metric tons. If sunlight was used instead of electricity, the GHG and NOx emissions could be reduced by as much as 79 and 84 %, respectively, and the SO, emissions could also be reduced.

AB  - Maleimides (1H-Pyrrole-2,5-diones) are monopyrrolic pigment derivatives with specific alkyl side chains that can be directly linked to their tetrapyrrole precursors, most notably chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls. These compounds can be used as palaeoenvironmental indicators such as algal productivity and redox conditions in ancient and modern aquatic systems. Here, we present a new method using two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-ToF-MS), which enables the rapid analysis of maleimides in complex mixtures and different matrices (e.g. sediments and soils), therefore largely simplifying the previous intricate maleimide purification protocol. This method also reduces the potential for bias associated with partial losses due to low recovery and the high volatility of maleimides. The maleimide distributions and concentrations obtained by GC x GC-ToF-MS were reproducible and in agreement with the previously used purification procedure followed by analysis with traditional gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). The new method also resolved previously unrecognised, partial coelution of some maleimides with unknown compounds by quantification with the m/z 75 fragment ion. Furthermore, the higher sensitivity enabled the detection of previously unrecognised and preliminarily identified maleimides based on their relative retention times. The new, easier, rapid and more sensitive GC x GC-ToF-MS method greatly facilitates the analysis of maleimides in environmental samples to study tetrapyrrole degradation processes and will further the development of maleimides as biomarkers for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the antifungal performance of three different Lactobacillus species. Experiments were conducted in vitro and in situ to extend the shelf life of wheat bread. Standard sourdough analyses were performed characterising acidity and carbohydrate levels. Overall, the strains showed good inhibition in vitro against the indicator mould Fusarium culmorum TMW4.2043. Sourdough bread fermented with Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM19280 performed best in the in situ shelf life experiment. An average shelf life extension of six more mould-free days was reached when compared to the non-acidified control bread. A range of antifungal-active acids like 3-phenyllactic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid in quantities between 0.1 and 360 mg/kg were present in the freeze-dried sourdoughs. Their concentration differed greatly amongst the species. However, a higher concentration of these compounds could not completely justify the growth inhibition of environmental moulds. In particular, although Lb. reuteri R29 produced the highest total concentration of these active compounds in the sourdough, its addition to bread did not result in a longest shelf life. Nevertheless, when the artificial compounds were spiked into a chemically acidified dough, it succeeded in a longer shelf life (+25 %) than achieved only by acidifying the dough. This provides evidence of their contribution to the antifungal activity and their synergy in concentration levels far below their single minimal inhibition concentrations under acidic conditions.

AB  - This paper explores the role of space-time constraints in determining the conditions under which people access to basic social services. To do so, the paper addresses two empirical questions: (i) how travel time impacts families' strategies for choosing and using social services, and (ii) how service characteristics become part of the constraints families have to face when using services. Both questions refer to problems that are of "time nature" (e.g., long waiting hours or the imposition of additional tasks and travel to finally obtain access to the service). The use of a space time approach introduces a theoretical innovation for studying access to urban public social services in the region, shedding light on the micro-processes underneath macro-aggregated indicators. This is performed by examining in a qualitative manner the way in which space time constraints are distributed among different types of families and by looking at families' strategies for accessing services in a city like Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. The empirical evidence is a qualitative study with 13 households with at least one child between 0 and 3 years of age. These households were selected from a purposive sample that allowed the study of a group of cases from different socioeconomic strata living in different geographical locations. The paper results suggest that households use travel time as an input to manage total time investment (travel plus participation) when defining a strategy to reach better services. In addition, empirical evidence reflects the distorting effects that uncertainty about the time to be spent in using the services may have on the activities of households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Malva parviflora (little mallow) is a wild herb with agricultural importance in Egypt, where it is cultivated as a food crop. The main objective of the present work was to study the distribution and common associated species of the arable weed, M.parviflora, in the Nile Delta, Egypt. In addition, the diversity and behavior of the common species along the prevailing environmental conditions were assessed. Fifty stands, representing five common habitats (crop fields, orchards, canals, drains and roadsides), were selected. Eighty-five species and one variety (50 annuals and 36 perennials) were recorded. Therophytes dominated the other life forms and biregional taxa contributed the highest chorological elements. Malva parviflora is a therophytic plant that has a Mediterranean distribution intermingled with Irano-Turanian elements. Moreover, the highest coverage percentage of M.parviflora was recorded in the canal banks. Four vegetation groups that represented the distinct habitats were produced by the application of a two-way indicator species analysis and a detrended correspondence analysis as a classification and ordination technique, respectively. Vegetation group C, which inhabited the crop fields, was the most diverse. A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that calcium carbonate, organic carbon, carbonate, potassium and the potassium adsorption ratio and electrical conductivity are the most effective soil variables on the distribution of M.parviflora and its associated species in the different habitats. It was found that M.parviflora was affected greatly by calcium carbonate, sand and magnesium. In addition, it was significantly associated with soil bicarbonate. Such a study could help in managing this important agricultural weed.

AB  - The Eifelian dolomites in the Zachelmie Quarry (Holy Cross Mountains, Poland) contain tracicways and tracks of tetrapods 390-391 Ma old, and thus the oldest known so far. The environments of the trackway-bearing beds have been investigated using sedimentological, palaeontological, geochemical and palaeomagnetic methods. The reconstructed tetrapod habitats comprised shallow-water lagoons separated from an open marine basin by sparsely vegetated islands and spits. The lagoonal waters were well-aerated and a few metres deep at most, undergoing periodic desiccation. The dolomitic sediments, primarily of microbial origin, formed in tropical waters of slightly modified marine composition. Oxygen isotope data obtained from the dolomicrites suggest water temperatures around 30 degrees C. The seasonal semi-arid to sub-humid climate, deduced from paleosol characteristics, was probably of a tropical monsoonal type. The degree of restriction of the lagoonal system evolved from relatively open, evaporation-dominated towards increasingly closed, freshwater influenced. The detailed observations of the footprint-bearing beds, as well as the characteristics of the tracks, indicate that they were formed mostly under subaqueous conditions, by wading, walking on the bottom or swimming animals. Lack of tidal indicators in the restricted Zachelmie lagoons argues against previous concept that tidal flats served as a food source for the early tetrapods. Nor is a hypothesis of flooded woodlands confirmed as a habitat promoting the "fish-to-tetrapod" transition. We propose that functional limbs emerged among aqueous animals that acquired their locomotional capabilities in a shallow lagoonal water before attempting longer excursions on land.

AB  - In this paper the relevant ecological factors were researched on the basis of indicator values present floristic composition, as the base for ecological characterization and differentiation of the investigated forest habitats. According to the multiple regression CCA model, the ecological factors representing the bioindication gradients of moisture, temperature and light were shown to be the most important for structure of species variability and differentiation of researched lowland floodplain forests. Analysis of Similarity has shown the greatest degree of bioindication divergence between two oppositely distributed coenoecological groups of forest types (CEG) in CCA model: CEG Pedunculate Oak and Hornbeam (Carpinion betuli ilyrico rnoesiacum Horv.56, suballiance Quercion roboris planarum Raus.76, as the most xerophilous and the most thermophilous) and CEG Swamp forest of Black Alder (Alnion glutinosae Malc.29), asthe most hygrophilous and conditionally the most frigoriphilous, whereby it indicates a complete divergence of overall ecological conditions represented by indicator values of floristic composition. According to SIMPER procedure, alternation of hygro-thermal gradient is the main factor of existing vegetation variability and differentiation of lowland forests of both floodplain and out-of-floodplain areas of RavniSrem. Additionally, according to their overall bioindication character the studied forest habitats were mostly: mesophilous-submesophilous, mesothermic, semi-sciophilous, neutrophilous and mesotrophic. Special attention was given to discussion of the broader geographic context of bioindication studies of various habitats in both floodplain and out-of-floodplain forest areas, with special consideration of correlation patterns in bioindication gradients.

AB  - Although warming air temperatures are contributing to permafrost degradation across the circumpolar zone, understanding of permafrost and environmental feedbacks to climate change is limited. Palsas can be used as indicators of permafrost stability given their sensitivity to changes in temperature and precipitation. However, field observations on the effects of vegetation cover are needed to compare permafrost dynamics of wooded and non-wooded palsas. This study examined the influence of vegetation on the soil thermal regime of wooded palsas covered by black spruce trees and non-wooded palsas covered by shrubs in discontinuous permafrost of the Boniface River area of northern Quebec, Canada. It investigated the effects of organic layer thickness, vegetation and snow depth on soil temperature at 50cm and 100cm depths for over 2years. The coldest summer soil temperatures were associated with thick organic layers. In summer, soil temperatures were colder under spruce stands than under shrub canopies and forest openings, whereas the thick snow cover in spruce stands and forest openings maintained warmer winter soil temperatures than under shrub canopies. Well-defined zero-curtain periods during fall and spring could be an early indicator of current changes in the soil thermal regime of palsas. At the northern edge of discontinuous permafrost, non-wooded palsas have the most favourable conditions for permafrost stability, because heterogeneous vegetation cover on wooded palsas promotes snow trapping and lateral heat transfer. Vegetation types should be considered in estimating future rates of permafrost degradation. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Fertility performance is intrinsically linked to the quality of the animal environment, overall management and nutrition. This review describes the use of dairy herd records, metabolic profiles and ultrasonographic findings at veterinary fertility examinations to monitor and manage dairy herd fertility. After calving, a cow has to overcome a series of physiological hurdles before establishing a pregnancy. The selection of timely key performance indicators (KPIs) that monitor specific events in the postpartum and service periods is vital to correctly identify problems and their potential causes that hopefully can be rectified. Cumulative sum charts are the timeliest monitors of efficiency of detection of oestrus, insemination outcome and relationship between postpartum events and fertility, with the point of inflection indicating when a change took place. Other KPIs use data from specific cohorts, adding an inherent delay to when change is indicated. Metabolic profiles and milk constituent data allow monitoring of nutritional adequacy and developments to offer new possibilities of on-farm systems for regular measurements of milk constituents (including progesterone) and energy status. Examination of the reproductive tract can be used to indicate individual and herd fertility status but the currently available detail is under used. Recent advances in ultrasonography can improve the diagnosis of reproductive tract pathophysiology still further but the clinical use of these methods in veterinary practice needs further evaluation. Development of new KPIs to exploit research findings are needed to ensure this knowledge is used to improve on-farm performance.

AB  - The distribution of non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) in a core from Cook's Bay, Lake Simcoe, shows a response to changes in water quality accompanying agriculture, urbanization and industrialization. Low concentrations of nutrients in sediments with little non-arboreal pollen (NAP) record low disturbance prior to European settlement approximate to 1850s. These sediments are rich in desmids such as Cosmarium spp., Euastrum spp., and Staurastrum spp., an assemblage indicative of oligotrophic conditions. A decline in desmids together with an increase in dinoflagellates and thecamoebians up-core is consistent with increased nutrients. Abundant phytoliths in sediments that are relatively rich in Poaceae and other NAP records the draining of the Holland Marshes. A sharp increase in nutrient levels, together with a transition from high nitrite (NO2) to high nitrate (NO3) concentrations, records a sudden increase in biological oxygen demand leading to depletion of dissolved oxygen associated with the creation of polders in the 1920s and 1930s. A second influx of phytoliths immediately preceded the sharp rise in Ambrosia, recording rapid land clearing accompanying the five-fold post-World War II population boom in the Cook's Bay watershed. These Ambrosia-rich sediments are rich in metals and have high total phosphorus and NO3, with abundant Pediastrum spp. and Peridinium spp., notably Peridinium willei and Peridinium volzii, recording eutrophication. The abundance of the ciliate Codonella cratera and the difflugiid thecamoebians Cucurbitella tricuspis and Difflugia protaeiformis in palynological preparations as well as in washed thecamoebian samples from the upper part of the core records low dissolved oxygen associated with continued eutrophication of Cook's Bay.

AB  - This paper discusses the performance analysis of an advanced adsorption desalination (AD) cycle with an internal heat recovery between the condenser and the evaporator. The AD cycle employs the adsorption-desorption principles to convert sea or brackish water into high-grade potable water with total dissolved solids (TDS) less than 10 ppm (mg/L) utilizing low-temperature heat source. The salient features of the AD cycle are the utilization of low temperature waste heat (typically 55 degrees C to 85 degrees C) with the employment of an environment-friendly silica gel/water pair and the low maintenance as it has no major moving parts other than the pumps and valves. For improved performance of the AD pilot plant, the internal heat recovery scheme between the condenser and evaporator has been implemented with a run-about water circuit between them. The efficacy of the scheme is analyzed in terms of key performance indicators such as the specific daily water production (SDWP) and the performance ratio (PR). Extensive experiments were performed for assorted heat source temperatures ranging from 70 degrees C to 50 degrees C. From the experiments, the SDWP of the AD cycle with the proposed heat recovery scheme is found to be 15 m(3) of water per ton of silica gel that is almost twice that of the yield obtained by a conventional AD cycle for the same operation conditions. Another important finding of AD desalination plant is that the advanced AD cycle could still be operational with an inlet heat source temperature of 50 degrees C and yet achieving a SDWP of 4.3 m(3) - a feat that never seen by any heat-driven cycles.

AB  - The degradation of a paracetamol (N-acetil-para-aminofenol) aqueous solution (C-0 (P) = 5mmol L-1) is studied in a bench-scale setup by means of simple ozonation (O-3) and ozonation catalyzed with UV light (O-3/UV) in order to quantify the influence of UV light on the degradation process. The results have shown that under the adopted experimental conditions (25 degrees C, applied ozone dose = 9.8mg L-1 and gas flow rate of 20 L h(1)) both oxidative systems are capable of removing the substrate with mineralization degrees up to 51% for ozonation and 53% for O-3/UV. HPICE chromatography allowed the detection of nitrate ions and maleic and oxalic acids as ultimate carboxylic acids. The experimental data have been interpreted through 5 indicators: the conversion of paracetamol (X-P ), the conversion degree of TOC (X-TOC ), the apparent rate constant (k(ap) ), the Hatta number (Ha) and the enhancement factor (E). The main advantage of photo-ozonation compared to simple ozonation was a more advanced conversion (79% vs. 92% after 90min). The paracetamol decay follows a pseudofirst-order reaction with a superior rate constant (higher by 54%) for the UV catalyzed system in comparison with direct ozonation. Mineralization is slightly accelerated (+4%) in the O-3/UV system, due to the additional production of hydroxyl radicals induced by the UV light and a higher Hatta number (+24%). Nevertheless, the process was still in the slow reaction kinetic regime (Ha < 0.3), and the enhancement factor was not significantly increased. The results are useful for the design and scale-up of the gas-liquid processes.

AB  - As an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa must be able to adapt and survive changes and stressors in its environment during the course of infection. To aid survival in the hostile host environment, P. aeruginosa has evolved defense mechanisms, including the production of an exopolysaccharide capsule and the secretion of a myriad of degradative proteases and lipases. The production of outer membrane-derived vesicles (OMVs) serves as a secretion mechanism for virulence factors as well as a general bacterial response to envelope-acting stressors. This study investigated the effect of sublethal physiological stressors on OMV production by P. aeruginosa and whether the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) and the MucD periplasmic protease are critical mechanistic factors in this response. Exposure to some environmental stressors was determined to increase the level of OMV production as well as the activity of AlgU, the sigma factor that controls MucD expression. Overexpression of AlgU was shown to be sufficient to induce OMV production; however, stress-induced OMV production was not dependent on activation of AlgU, since stress caused increased vesiculation in strains lacking algU. We further determined that MucD levels were not an indicator of OMV production under acute stress, and PQS was not required for OMV production under stress or unstressed conditions. Finally, an investigation of the response of P. aeruginosa to oxidative stress revealed that peroxide-induced OMV production requires the presence of B-band but not A-band lipopolysaccharide. Together, these results demonstrate that distinct mechanisms exist for stress-induced OMV production in P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Ecstasy (MDMA) is used predominately by adolescents and young adults. Young MDMA users are more likely than non-users to use other drugs, including cocaine. The response to stimulant drugs can be affected by environmental factors; however, little information exists about the role that housing plays in mediating effects of MDMA in adolescence.
   The present experiment examined whether social and environmental factors alter effects of MDMA on activity and cocaine reward.
   Male adolescent rats were housed on PND 23. Isolated rats were housed alone (1 rat/cage) in an impoverished environment with no toys (II) or enriched with toys (IE). Social rats were housed three/cage with (SE3) or without (SI3) toys. Starting on PND 29, 5 mg/kg MDMA or saline was injected and activity was measured for 60 min once daily for five consecutive days. On PND 36-40, cocaine CPP was conducted.
   Saline vehicle-induced activity of II rats was higher than other groups, and all groups became sensitized to the locomotor-stimulant effects of MDMA. In II rats, maximal CPP was increased after MDMA pre-exposure compared to vehicle. Environmental enrichment blocked this; however, dose-effect curves for cocaine CPP shifted to the left in both IE and SE3 rats. In rats with just social enrichment, there were no effects of MDMA on cocaine CPP.
   Drug prevention and treatment strategies should take into account different environments in which adolescents live. These findings show that MDMA increases cocaine reward in male adolescents, and social enrichment diminishes, while environmental enrichment enhances this.

AB  - Rock magnetic, petrographic and dielectric analyses were carried out, in a number of archeological ceramic potsherds, in order to characterize the different manufacturing techniques used by Prehistoric Venezuelan Amerindian potters. Samples were excavated in 7 Venezuelan islands and ascribed to distinct cultural groups on purely stylistic grounds (i.e. Valencioide, Ocumaroide, Dabajuroide and Unknown). Mean coercivity values were determined through a direct signal analyses (DSA) applied to isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition curves. Logarithmic plots of these mean coercivities are the best quantitative means to classify diverse ceramics. The mean coercivity values seem to group the samples according to the manufacturing development. These values also seem to discriminate the samples provenance, indeed, this plot displays a good grouping of data for samples presumably manufactured by the same culture but excavated at different locations. Thermomagnetic cycles supply helpful information about original ceramic firing conditions. The irreversibility parameter (IP) for thermomagnetic curves (heating and cooling), serves as an indicator of the amount of organic matter burnt during original pottery firing. The IP for a number of pottery samples from Venezuelan islands and mainland, with ages ranging between 300 BC to 1500 AD, might suggest a possible increasing trend in time towards the complete reversibility line of IP = 0. Most samples, independently of age and cultural group, have IP values that suggest that most open fires, used by primitive Venezuelan Amerindian potters, had enough ventilation and oxidizing atmospheres. A scatter plot of maximum current depolarization temperatures versus natural remanent magnetization (NRM) suggests a complex non-linear relationship between these two parameters most likely due to the fact that both, dielectric and rock magnetic data, are linked to pore-related features.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the level of some trace metal accamulation (Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu) in the leaves, needles, and twigs of some natural and exotic tree and shrub species which were selected and tested as a biomonitors of these heavy metals grown in the centre and suburbs (Atakum) of Samsun, Turkey polluted by burning fossil fuels and heavy traffic conditions from December 2007 to August 2008. Air pollution from traffic density was very important for Samsun in both the winter and summer periods. Because of this reason leaf and twig samples of these species were collected in winter and summer separately. Statistically significant differences were found among the studied species regarding studied heavy metals. The highest heavy metal concentrations were found in M. grandiflora, although heavy metal concentrations may be different according to the studied species, sampling points and sampling periods. According to the obtained data it was found that M. grandiflora, Ligustrutn vulgare and Phoenix dactylifera can be used as biomonitors (i.e. the highest Cu concentrations were found in Samsun city in P dactylifera leaves (45.10) and M. grandiflora leaves (62.00) and the highest Zn concentration was found in L. vulgare leaves (69.58) during the summer. Because these species accumulated higher concentrations of heavy metals in their tissues as compared to other species. Finally, it was found that different parts of evergreen plants (i.e. leaves and twigs) can be used as biomonitors in determining heavy metal pollution.

AB  - Numerous commercial products incorporate novel engineered nanomaterials such as gold, silica, zinc oxide, and fullerenes in complex matrices such as polymer composites, creams, and textiles. Analytical methods for detecting nanomaterials in complex matrices are not well developed. Moreover, nanomaterial content and properties of these commercial products are typically unknown and protected for proprietary reasons. This study had two primary aims: detection of C-60 within commercial face creams to establish a baseline concentration in these products (the first time this has been performed) and detection of residual C-60 reactivity remaining in the products aged in water under various light conditions with a view toward environmental exposure assessment. To achieve these aims, three commercial creams advertised as containing the fullerene nanomaterials were investigated using a range of analytical techniques. Among the detection methods tested, only extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography was able to detect fullerenes in these products. The measured quantities of C-60 in these creams represented <0.005% (w/w) with an unknown yield because total amounts added to the creams were unknown. Production of reactive oxygen species from these face creams was measured after aging them in water as well as exposing them to solar spectrum illumination or ultraviolet light, or storage in the dark. Singlet oxygen generated in the products after 48 h of aging was correlated with the amounts of C-60 extracted from preaged samples, indicating residual photochemical reactivity and pointing toward the long-term impacts of utilizing these materials in commercial products.

AB  - This study examines the sedimentary evidence of human activities during the last 4000 years in the Pearl River deltaic area. The analyses are focused on indentifying agricultural signatures present in the sedimentary record and establishing the timing of a change from a simple, rice-based agriculture to a more advanced, diverse agriculture. The examination is based on modern sediment and plant samples and a sediment core collected from the deltaic area. The analyses include particle size and diatom analysis to determine the environmental conditions that were associated with the period of human activities. Organic carbon isotope ratios and major metal elements reveal an expansion in commercial crop production and metal smelting in the Pearl River delta area about 2000 years ago. The input of organic matter from introduced sugarcane, a C4 plant, elevates the bulk organic carbon isotope values in the estuarine sediments above that represented by other common agricultural crops in the study area, including rice, banana and lotus, which are all C3 plants. The increase in bulk organic isotopic value coincides with the rise in the concentration of copper, iron and lead in the sedimentary sequence, suggesting a wider use of metal tools. These results indicate that advanced agriculture started about 2000 years ago as an expansion in human population took place in the area. This record also provides sedimentary evidence that help ascertain the timing and type of human activities that are linked to subsequent land reclamation on the deltaic plain, resulting in rapid shoreline advancement in the last 2000 years.

AB  - This paper describes a framework of criteria and indicators to evaluate the status of performance of the forest protection committees of India in managing community forests under the joint Forest Management programme. The framework consists of 3 principles, 6 criteria, 12 indicators and 18 verifiers and was applied for assessment of forest protection committees operating in south-west West Bengal, India. The study area is dominated by dry deciduous forests, mostly in degraded state. An analysis guide along with a set of questionnaire was prepared to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the forest protection committees. An ecological study was also carried out simultaneously in the forest areas protected by the corresponding forest protection committees to measure the condition of forests.
   Results from the Study Suggest that the developed criteria and indicators form an effective framework for assessing the extent of implementation of sustainable forest management principles in the context of community forestry. The methodology used in this study is designed to be simple, easily comprehendible and quantifiable so as to implement it in the grass-root level by field persons without any major difficulty.
   Regarding performance of the committees, the study reveals that there exists a highly positive relationship between the level of functioning of the committees and the status of health of the forests and vice versa. it is also found that the functional status of a forest protection committee depends mostly on the extent of group cohesiveness present among the members of the committee.

AB  - Light-dependent behavior of the abundant zooplankton species inhabiting the White Sea were studied experimentally during: (i) the spring equinox (March); (ii) the polar day (late May to June), (iii) August, 17/7 h day-night light cycle, (iv) the fall equinox (October). Behavioral patterns were investigated for eight species of Copepoda (Metridia longa, Calanus glacialis, Pseudocalanus minutus, Oithona similis, Oncaea borealis, Temora longicornis, Centropages hamatus, Acartia spp.), one Cladocera species (Evadne nordmanni) and Polychaeta larvae. The hypothesis was tested that attraction to (or repulsion from) light is the primary mechanism involved in the vertical migration of zooplankton with different trophic characteristics in relation to phytoplankton-rich upper water layer. The impact of red (680 nm), yellow (560 nm) and UV (280 nm) light was tested. The animals were acclimated to two food conditions: natural seawater (satiated) and filtered (1 mu m) seawater (hungry). The positive light response of predominantly herbivorous and omnivorous copepods and cladocerans inhabiting the photic water layer corresponds with their distribution and their food vertical distribution. Hungry animals display the strongest responses to light. Light effects on behavior were weak in deep-dwelling O. borealis. We suggest that red and yellow light is an indicator of the photic layer (high food concentration) to zooplankton groups that feed on phytoplankton. In contrast, diapausing (e.g. non-feeding) copepods totally avoid light, especially when they hibernate in the aphotic layer. We hypothesize that there is a relationship between the light response of the zooplankton, their trophic characteristics, migration behavior (diel and ontogenetic) and the water layer occupied.

AB  - The Adenoviridae family comprises a wide diversity of viruses that may be excreted for long periods in feces or urine. Previous studies have suggested that the detection of human and animal adenoviruses as well as human and animal polyomaviruses by PCR could be used as an index of fecal contamination of human and animal origin. In this study, quantitative PCR assays targeting specifically porcine adenoviruses have been developed and applied to fecal and environmental samples, including pig slurries, urban sewage, slaughterhouse sewage and river water samples. To develop real-time quantitative PCR for the detection and quantitation of porcine adenoviruses, primers and a TaqMan probe targeting a 68-bp region of the porcine adenovirus hexon gene were designed to amplify specifically porcine adenovirus, and the conditions of the reaction were optimized. The assay detected 1-10 genome copies per test tube and was specific in showing no positive results when samples containing human or bovine adenoviruses were analyzed. Fecal samples contained mean concentrations of porcine adenoviruses of 10(5) GC/g while slaughterhouse wastewater samples showed mean values of 10(3) GC/ml. The assay detected porcine fecal pollution in samples that were highly diluted and had been collected at a considerable distance from the input source, such as river water. In general, the data presented here provide a quantitative tool for the analysis of porcine adenoviruses as indicators of the presence of porcine contamination in the environment, and support the detection of porcine adenoviruses by real-time quantitative PCR as a promising and valuable tool for source-tracking studies.

AB  - Dwellings showing a presence of moulds are considered to be unhealthy both by the inhabitants and by sanitary authorities. Although the thresholds of pathogenicity have not yet been established, the toxic, allergic and infectious risk of indoor moulds is better understood today. A study on indoor fungi contamination for 128 dwellings was done between October and May in France. It concerned 69 dwellings, the occupants of which either complained to the sanitary authorities about problems of moulds and humidity or consulted a doctor who related their symptoms to housing conditions. Fifty-nine other dwellings, the occupants of which were healthy, constituted the control group. We present the statistical analysis of questionnaires, which aimed to clarify characteristics of dwellings associated with high concentrations of airborne moulds. Air samples were taken with an impactor in 500 rooms. On visiting dwellings, investigators obtained answers to 25 questions concerning characteristics of inhabitants and living space, as well as the presence of mould indicators. Indoor and outdoor temperature and indoor relative humidity of air measurements were taken. The total concentration of fungi in the air was significantly higher in ground floor apartments versus those on other floors (p = 0.047), in small and highly occupied dwellings (p = 0.03 and 0.003), in dwellings with electric heating (p = 0.04), without a ventilation system (p = 0.003), with water damage (p = 0.003), and finally, in those where the investigator noted an odour of moisture or visible moulds (p < 0.001). The efficacy of the latter criteria in the evaluation of insalubrity is discussed.

AB  - Non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) are organic-walled microfossils that one frequently come across in palynological preparations during pollen analysis. Like pollen and spores they are more resistant to corrosion, and as such they too get preserved but not destroyed during maceration using HF and other strong acids. They provide an alternative source of palaeo-information where there is scarcity of pollen and spores in the sediments. Records of NPP in the Late Quaternary sediments form a valuable addition to the pollen-spore data of the lagoonal sediments of Kerala and the pollen pauper deposits of Gujarat coast, as not much palynological data are available from the west coast of India. The occurrence of Botryococcus, Pediastrum and colonies of Rivularia (cyanobacteria) in the Holocene sequence has considerable significance to ascertain the hydrological changes associated with the evolution of lagoons of the Kerala basin. Glomus cf.fasciculatum and thecamoebians are useful in the interpretation of soil conditions associated with aridity/stressed environment along the Gujarat coast. The abundance of microscopic charcoal and charred epidermal fragments of Poaceae (grasses and like forms) is related to fire-associated events, including that of human impact. Thus, the palaeoenvironmental indicator value of NPP is evident from the Late Quaternary deposits of the west coast of India. Study of these non-pollen microfossils has helped develop a new database on them. Further, a combined approach of pollen and NPP allows for better understanding of palaeoecological changes and also to assess the relative importance of climate change during the Holocene.

AB  - The potentially lethal bleaching of invertebrates through loss of their algal symbionts is a major global conservation issue; cnidarians in such interactions could potentially withstand environmental change by having multiple symbiotic partners whose physiologies vary with critical field parameters such as temperature and light. Spatial variation in symbiont distributions in the field is a strong indicator of such potential. We show that, in an association between an abundant temperate sea anemone and its two endosymbionts, the dinophyte Symbiodinium muscatinei (zooxanthellae) and an unidentified green alga (zoochlorellae), densities and ratios of anemones' symbionts change along a light gradient generated by intertidal caves in Washington state. In the laboratory, the photosynthetic performance of zooxanthellate anemones exceeded that of zoochlorellate anemones under high irradiance levels (>100 tmol quanta m(-2) s(-1)). Further, field sampling revealed that caves are divided into three distinct regions based on anemones' algal complements: a brown region of zooxanthellate anemones near the mouth of the cave, a green region of zoochlorellate anemones in the middle of the cave, and a white region of algae-free anemones near the back of the cave. These data, together with field reciprocal transplant experiments showing algae-free anemones' ability to regrow algae consistent with local physical conditions, suggest that algal performance (vs. host selection) determines observed variation in these symbioses. Our results support the idea that temperate, as well as tropical, host-symbiont associations can respond plastically to environmental change. Our data also suggest that intact symbioses in adult hosts are surprisingly stable; bleaching may be required in rearranging host-symbiont associations.

AB  - Swimming advisories due to excessive Escherichia coli concentrations are common at 63rd Street Beach, Chicago, Ill. An intensive study was undertaken to characterize the source and fate of E. coli in beach water and sand at the beach. From April through September 2000, water and sand samples were collected daily or twice daily at two depths on three consecutive days per week (water samples, n = 1,747; sand samples, n = 858); hydrometeorological conditions and bird and bather distributions were also recorded. E. coli concentrations in sand and water were significantly correlated, with the highest concentration being found in foreshore sand, followed by those in submerged sediment and water of increasing depth. Gull contributions to E. coli densities in sand and water were most apparent on the day following gull activity in a given area. E. coli recolonized newly placed foreshore sand within 2 weeks. Analysis of variance, correlation, cluster analyses, concentration gradients, temporal-spatial distribution, demographic patterns, and DNA fingerprinting suggest that E. coli may be able to sustain population density in temperate beach sand during summer months without external inputs. This research presents evidence that foreshore beach sand (i) plays a major role in bacterial lake water quality, (ii) is an important non-point source of E. coli to lake water rather than a net sink, (iii) may be environmentally, and perhaps hygienically, problematic, and (iv) is possibly capable of supporting an autochthonous, high density of indicator bacteria for sustained periods, independent of lake, human, or animal input.

AB  - Peatland testate amoebae are sensitive indicators of local hydrology and have been used as proxies for surface moisture conditions in fossil studies. However, few regional calibration datasets exist in North America, and knowledge of testate amoeba ecology and distribution patterns are limited. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the relationship between testate amoebae, environment, and Sphagnum species in Michigan peatlands; (2) generate transfer functions from this dataset that can be applied to fossil data; and (3) describe vertical variation of testate amoebae inhabiting Sphagnum moss. Testate amoeba assemblages from 139 microsites within 11 peatlands in Michigan were compared to assess variability between and within peatlands. Most peatlands contained similar testate amoeba assemblages, although within individual peatlands the amount of assemblage variability is correlated to the amount of environmental heterogeneity. Of the measured environmental variables, depth to water table showed the strongest relationship with testate amoebae. Depth to water table can be reconstructed from fossil data with a mean error of +/- 7.5 cm, although predictive ability deteriorates in extremely dry environments (>30 cm water table depth). Vertical variation in testate amoeba assemblages was investigated at 89 Sphagnum-dominated microsites by directly comparing amoeba assemblages and the abundance and frequency of common taxa in upper and lower portions of the Sphagnum stem. Except for extremely dry microsites, considerable vertical variation in assemblage composition exists. Many agglutinate taxa are more abundant on lower portions of the Sphagnum stem, and taxa containing symbiotic zoochlorellae are more abundant on upper portions. Refinements in sampling procedures and analysis may improve the predictive ability of transfer functions.

AB  - Knowledge of in-process oxygen transfer is essential to the optimum design and operation of aeration systems in activated sludge processes. In this study, non-steady state H2O2, oxygen transfer tests were performed in a laboratory scale, University of Cape Town configuration biological nutrient removal process (BNR) to measure the in-process oxygen transfer rates. Given the small quantity (about 1ml @30% concentration) of HA used in the aerobic reactor with a mixed liquor volume of 161 (total system working volume of 33.65 1), no effect on the process performance itself was expected. However, the process performance data obtained indicated results to the contrary. Use of H2O2 in measuring process oxygen transfer rates may not be suitable for BNR processes, as all the major process performance indicators (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal by the system and carbon uptake and phosphorus release in the anaerobic zone) were negatively affected. Evidence in this work leads to the conclusion that external addition of H2O2 leads to excessive production of the hydroxyl radical. Since microorganisms do not have enzyme systems capable of acting upon this additional reactive radical, it resulted in loss of process performance. It is also possible that H2O2 could have upset the normal aerobic respiration process by introducing oxidative stress conditions on the catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase enzymes that deal with other oxygen radicals generated as part of the overall process of reducing oxygen to water. Any test that interferes with the system in which the test is being performed is suspect. Therefore, in light of these results, the H2O2 method to test in-process oxygen transfer should be re-evaluated.

AB  - An aerobic biofilter system was studied to assess its effectiveness for reducing enteric microbial indicators in flushed Swine wastewater under different seasonal conditions. A laboratory-scale, low-pressure UV collimated beam apparatus was used to investigate the effectiveness of UV irradiation for inactivating enteric bacteria, coliphages, and bacterial spores in treated and untreated swine wastewater having unfiltered absorbances of 5 to 11 cm(-1) and total suspended solids concentrations of 500 to 1200 mg/L. Fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, somatic coliphages, and male-specific coliphages were reduced by 97 to 99% in the biofilter system when reactor water temperatures were between 23 and 32 degreesC. Salmonella were reduced by 95 to 97% when water temperatures were 17 to 32 degreesC. Of the six microbial indicators studied, Clostridium perfringens spores were typically reduced the least by the biofilter system. At an average absorbed UV irradiation dose of 13 mJ/cm(2), maximum reductions of fecal coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, C. perfringens spores, and somatic coliphages in biofilter system effluent were 2.2, 2.1, 1.3, 0.2, and 2.3 log(10), respectively. The results of this study show that the aerobic biofilter system can be an effective alternative for treatment of flushed swine waste. Ultraviolet irradiation can be effective for further reducing enteric microbe concentrations in biologically-treated swine waste, as well as in lower quality wastewaters, indicating its general potential for pathogen reductions in low-quality wastewaters intended for beneficial reuse.

AB  - The Amoco Cadiz oil spill in 1978, and the Aegean Sea oil spill in 1992, affected soft-bottom communities, respectively from the Bay of Morlaix (western English Channel) and from the Ria de Ares and Betanzos in the northwestern Iberian peninsula. These infralittoral communities on muddy fine sand showed similar species composition and structure and occurred in similar hydro-climatic conditions. The effects of the spills were identical in both areas with the disappearance of the amphipods especially those from the amphipod genus Ampelisca with a very low colonization of these species during the four years after the spill. The recovery rate of the amphipods was slow but progressive, In such communities no proliferation of opportunistics was observed after the stress. In the sites, where polychaetes dominated before the spill, they remained dominant, whereas other sites showed very low total abundances during the two years after the spill due to the absence of compensation for the disappearance of these crustaceans, In fact, there was a very low impact of the spill on polychaetes, but a high one on amphipods, In the future, it is suggested to focus monitoring after a spill only on a single amphipod group proposed as a bioindicator for detecting the impact of pollution. A polychaete/amphipod ratio is proposed to reflect temporal change of soft-bottom communities analogous to the nematode/copepod previously suggested for the meiobenthos, Detailed knowledge of the qualitative and quantitative structure of a benthic community is still needed in order to identify very precisely the effect of a pollution event.

AB  - In contrast to the wide range of studies carried out in temperate and high-latitude oceanic regions, only a few studies have focused on recent and Holocene organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from the tropics. This information is, however, essential for fully understanding the ability of species to adapt to different oceanographic regimes, and ultimately their potential application to local and regional palaeoenvironmental and palaeoceanographic reconstructions. Surface sediment samples of the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean north of Brazil, an area greatly influenced by Amazon River discharge waters, were therefore analysed in detail for their organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst content. A diverse association of 43 taxa was identified, and large differences in cyst distribution were observed. The cyst thanatocoenosis in bottom sediments reflects the seasonal advection of Amazon River discharge water through the Guyana Current and the North Equatorial Countercurrent well into the North Atlantic. To establish potential links between cyst distribution and the environmental conditions of the upper water column, distribution patterns were compared with mean temperature, salinity, density and stratification gradients within the upper water column (0-100 m) over different times of the year, using correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. The analyses show that differences in these parameters only play a subordinate role in determining species distribution. Instead, nutrient availability, or related factors, dominates the distribution pattern. The only possible indicators of slightly reduced salinities are Trinovantedinium applanatum and Lingulodinium machaerophorum. Four assemblage groups of cyst taxa with similar environmental affinities related to specific water masses/currents can be distinguished and have potential for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.

AB  - It has long been known that cholera outbreaks can be initiated when Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera, is present in drinking water in sufficient numbers to constitute an infective dose, if ingested by humans. Outbreaks associated with drinking or bathing in unpurified river or brackish water may directly or indirectly depend on such conditions as water temperature, nutrient concentration, and plankton production that may be favorable for growth and reproduction of the bacterium. Although these environmental parameters have routinely been measured by using water samples collected aboard research ships, the available data sets are sparse and infrequent. Furthermore, shipboard data acquisition is both expensive and time-consuming. Interpolation to regional scales can also be problematic. Although the bacterium, V. cholerae, cannot be sensed directly, remotely sensed data can be used to infer its presence. In the study reported here, satellite data were used to monitor the timing and spread of cholera. Public domain remote sensing data for the Bay of Bengal were compared directly with cholera case data collected in Bangladesh from 1992-1995, The remote sensing data included sea surface temperature and sea surface height. It was discovered that sea surface temperature shows an annual cycle similar to the cholera case data. Sea surface height may be an indicator of incursion of plankton-laden water inland, e.g., tidal rivers, because it was also found to be correlated with cholera outbreaks. The extensive studies accomplished during the past 25 years, confirming the hypothesis that V, cholerae is autochthonous to the aquatic environment and is a commensal of zooplankton, i.e,, copepods, when combined with the findings of the satellite data analyses, provide strong evidence that cholera epidemics are climate-linked.

AB  - The high relative humidity of the air and many potential growth media, such as bedding materials, hay and grains in the horse stable, for example, provide suitable conditions for fungal growth. Metabolic activity of four common agricultural fungi incubated in peat and wood shavings at 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C was characterized in this study using previously specified volatile metabolites of micro-organisms and CO2 production as indicators. The volatile organic compounds were collected into Tenax resin and analysed by gas chromatography. Several microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs), e.g. 1-butanol, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol and l-octanol were detected in laboratory experiments; however, these accounted for only 0.08-1.5% of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs). Emission rates of MVOCs were 0.001-0.176 mu g/kg of bedding materials per hour. Despite some limitations of the analytical method, certain individual MVOCs, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone and 3-octanone, were also detected in concentrations of less than 4.6 mu g/m(3) (0.07-0.31% of TVOC) in a horse stable where pear and shavings were used as bedding materials. MVOC emission rate was estimated to be 0.2-2.0 mu g/kg x h(-1) from bedding materials in the stable, being about ten times higher than the rates found in the laboratory experiments. Some compounds, e.g. 3-octanone and 1-octen-3-ol, can be assumed to originate mainly from microbial metabolisms.

AB  - A voltammetric DNA sensor based on the polyelectrolyte complexes of polyethylenimine and DNA obtained by self-assembly from solutions of components on a glassy carbon electrode has been developed. Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the preparation conditions and characterize the permeability of the complex for low-molecular-weight redox indicators differing in the mechanism of interaction with DNA (methylene blue and methylene green). The formation of the polyelectrolyte complex was independently confirmed by surface plasmon resonance measurements. The redox peak currents of methylene blue and methylene green varied differently depending on the number of layers of the complex and the nature of the outer layer due to different mechanisms of binding the indicators to DNA molecules and varied assembly density of the complex polyelectrolytes. An increase in the concentration of polyions from 0.1 to 10 mu g/mL suppressed the effect of the charge of the outer layer on the indicator currents. Polyelectrolyte coatings were tested to detect specific DNA interactions including intercalation with the anticancer drug doxorubicin and the thermal and chemical denaturation of DNA. It was found that the introduction of decacarboxylated pillar[5]arene into the layer increased the sensitivity of the methylene blue signal to the thermal denaturation of DNA. A comparison between changes in the peak currents of methylene blue and methylene green makes it possible to distinguish the mechanism of DNA damage and separately take into account the contribution of the considered chemical and physical damaging factors. The developed DNA sensor makes it possible to semiquantitatively evaluate the protective effect of antioxidants, which decrease the effect of reactive oxygen species on DNA in the biosensor.

AB  - center dot Key message The shrub species richness in Spanish forests is mainly linked to climatic variables and the importance of the groups of variables scarcely differs among forest types. Forest surrounding the Mediterranean Basin exhibit the highest levels of shrub richness. center dot Context Shrub species account for a high proportion of the plant diversity in Spanish forests and are a determinant factor in forest dynamics and ecosystem functionality. center dot Aims To investigate the relative importance of climatic, forest stand features, soil and topographic variables in explaining shrub richness in Spanish forests and if the relative importance of these four groups of variables reflects variations among forest types. center dot Methods We used the Spanish National Forest Inventory and a boosted regression trees approach to identify which climatic, soil, stand and topographic variables (N = 19 variables) are related to the richness of shrub species in Spanish woodlands. center dot Results The shrub species richness is mainly related to climatic variables followed by soil variables whereas stand and topographic variables play a minor role. The importance of the groups of variables scarcely differs among forest types although forests located around the Mediterranean Sea display the highest levels of shrub richness. center dot Conclusion Shrub richness in Spain is primarily driven by climatic and soil variables, both at country and forest-type scales. Forests surrounding the Mediterranean Basin account for the highest richness of shrub species but are also those most threatened by global change. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the monitoring and assessment of these forest ecosystems.

AB  - The large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), which is an economically important mariculture fish in China, is often exposed to environmental hypoxia. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis is essential for the maintenance of normal physiological conditions in an organism. Direct evidence that environmental hypoxia leads to ROS overproduction is scarce in marine fish. Furthermore, the sources of ROS overproduction in marine fish under hypoxic stress are poorly known. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on redox homeostasis in L. crocea and the impact of impaired redox homeostasis on fish. We first confirmed that hypoxia drove ROS production mainly via the mitochondrial electron transport chain and NADPH oxidase complex pathways in L. crocea and its cell line (large yellow croaker fry (LYCF) cells). We subsequently detected a marked increase in the antioxidant systems of the fish. However, imbalance between the pro-oxidation and antioxidation systems ultimately led to excessive ROS and oxidative stress. Cell viability showed a remarkable decrease while oxidative indicators, such as malondialdehyde, protein carbonylation, and 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine, showed a significant increase after hypoxia, accompanied by tissue damage. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced ROS levels, alleviated oxidative damage, and improved cell viability in vitro. Appropriate uptake of ROS scavengers (e.g., NAC and elamipretide Szeto-Schiller-31) and inhibitors (e.g., apocynin, diphenylene iodonium, and 5-hydroxydecanoate) may be effective at overcoming hypoxic toxicity. Our findings highlight previously unstudied strategies of hypoxic toxicity resistance in marine fish.

AB  - This study investigated the biological consequences of 45-day continuous ozonation on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts in a brackish water recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). There was no significant difference in survival, operational welfare indicators, and average weight at termination between the ozone-treated and control groups. Plasma biochemical analyses revealed that the creatinine level was significantly higher in the ozone-treated group than in the control at termination. Histological evaluation of skin health showed no significant difference between the two groups. On the other hand, quantitative histopathology disclosed that the ozone group exhibited a better gill health status than did the control group, particularly at the end of the trial. Mucosal transcriptomics revealed a distinct response profile between the gills and skin. At day 45, there were no differentially expressed genes (DEG) identified in the skin, in contrast to 242 ozone-induced DEGs in the gills. Assessment of the transcriptomic profiles over time revealed that temporal effects were of greater impact in skin compared to gills, regardless of the treatment. The treatment did not result in metabolomic dysregulation and the overall profile lent support to the transcriptomics data that temporal effects had a greater influence on the changes observed. Exposure to handling-confinement stress revealed that ozone treatment did not alter the ability of post-smolts to respond to a secondary stressor. In summary, the suite of health and welfare indicators collectively indicated that continuous ozonation resulted in minimal physiological perturbations in salmon postsmolts. The results are expected to contribute to optimising the rearing conditions for post-smolts in RAS.

AB  - When environmental conditions change, species usually face three options: adaptation, range shifts, or extinction. In the wake of climate change, it is generally believed that range shifts are the norm in mobile species such as birds, resulting in poleward range shifts. The European Bee-eater is a predominantly Mediterranean species which has expanded its range to higher latitudes over the last decades. Germany in particular has seen a surge in breeding pairs and foundation of new colonies. However, while many experts suggest climate warming as the main driver behind this range expansion, an explicit quantification remains open. Here, we use an ensemble modelling approach to study the recent climatic niche suitability of the European Bee-eater across Europe with a special focus on Germany and project its predicted Palaearctic breeding distribution onto the year 2050 using two global circulation models and two representative concentration pathways. Models were able to predict the current European range of the species with some underestimated areas in Central and Eastern Europe, depending on the selected model. We found a strong relationship between climatic suitable areas and estimated population sizes across European countries that is reflected in most algorithms. In particular, the German population size is in line with climate suitability in the country suggesting a strong climate-population relationship and a high degree of niche filling. Most future predictions point to an ongoing northward expansion of the species while areas in Southern Europe and the Maghreb area remain largely suitable. The strong climate-population relationship makes the European Bee-eater an appropriate indicator species for climate change. Yet the high variability of modelling algorithms also call for caution of using these techniques without careful inspection.

T2  - BIRD STUDY
LA  - English
AB  - Capsule: The Eurasian Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus is an obligate scavenger relying on spatially and temporally unpredictable food resources. We demonstrate how high-frequency telemetry data can be efficiently used to identify vultures' feeding locations in the wild and study their diet.
   Aims: To study the Griffon Vulture diet composition, seasonal variations, and bathing frequency in an area with high natural food availability.
   Methods: We used a remote-sensing technique based on GPS and accelerometry data to identify the feeding locations, and ground-truthing to identify the carcass species and investigate the causes of mortality.
   Results: We identified 13 taxa in the diet of Griffon Vultures. Cattle comprised 48.5% of the diet, followed by sheep (24.3%), while wild animals were 13.1%. We observed seasonal variation in the proportion of small stock and game species in the diet. Predation was reported as the main cause of mortality (60.2%) for prey species, while natural causes accounted for 37.6%. Vultures were mainly feeding in areas south of their breeding colonies in Bulgaria and Greece. Natural springs and fountains were regularly used by the Griffon Vultures for bathing and drinking, especially in the summer.
   Conclusions: Free-ranging livestock creates favourable feeding conditions for vultures, especially in areas with rugged terrain and a high density of predators. An increase in the number of wild ungulates can potentially buffer the fluctuations in livestock numbers and be beneficial for vultures, especially in the autumn and winter months. Lead ammunition must be substituted with non-toxic alternatives to reduce the exposure of vultures and other scavengers to lead poisoning.

AB  - Algal bloom is a serious global issue for inland waters, posing poses a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems. The timely and accurate detection of algal blooms is critical for their control, management and forecasting. Optical satellite imagery with short revisit times has been widely used to monitor algal blooms in marine and large inland waters. However, such images typically are of coarse resolution, limiting their utility to map algal blooms in small inland waters. We developed a new method to map the spatial extent of algal blooms using sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and Landsat operational land imager (OLI) images with higher spatial resolution but lower temporal resolution based on the concept of local indicator of spatial association. The mapping results was applied to measure the duration and frequency of algal blooms in Lake Taihu from 2017 to 2020. Our results show that the developed methodology is able to extract the spatial distribution of moderate algal blooms using near-infrared and red-edge bands (bands 6, 7, 8, and 8a of sentinel-2 MSI images or band 5 of Landsat OLI images) by comparison with MODIS FAI data (R2 = 0.888 for sentinel-2 MSI and R2 = 0.85 for Landsat OLI, P < 0.05). However, the temporal resolution of combined Landsat OLI and sentinel-2 MSI images (i.e., up to 2-3 days) is insufficient to monitor algal blooms during the summer time in Lake Taihu due to cloud effects and rapid algal change. Our research has benefits for the management of small inland waters with complex water conditions.

AB  - In this paper, a novel two-stage structural damage detection method using modal flexibility and strain energy-based index (MFSEBI) and modified teaching-learning-based optimization (MTLBO) algorithm is proposed. In the first stage, a novel damage index (MFSEBI) is proposed based on the combination of two structural modal properties including modal strain energy of elements and diagonal members of the structural flexibility matrix to identify the suspected damaged elements. The performance of this indicator is compared with the performance of an indicator derived from the modal strain energy. As the change in the structural modal properties is also affected by environmental variations, in this study, the effect of varying environmental conditions on the performance of the MFSEBI is also examined. In the second stage, the modal response of the structure is used and subsequently updated by MLTBO to estimate the damage extents of the suspected elements. At this stage, the MTLBO algorithm is proposed by enhancing the teaching and learning quality of the TLBO algorithm using new updating mechanisms of each learner position. The performance of the MTLBO and TLBO algorithms is compared in terms of the accuracy of the results and convergence rate. The results of three numerical examples indicate a better performance of the MFSEBI index in damage localization using a smaller number of mode shapes. These results also demonstrate the higher accuracy of the estimated damage extents and the faster convergence rate of the objective function using MTLBO, even with the consideration of measurement noise effects.

AB  - The 'scaling up' objection says non-representational ecological-enactive accounts will be unable to explain 'representation hungry' cognition. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) presents a paradigmatic instance of this objection, marked as it is by 'representation hungry' obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior organized around them. In this paper I provide an ecological-enactive account of OCD, thereby demonstrating non-representational frameworks can 'scale up' to explain 'representation hungry' cognition. First, I outline a non-representational account of mind- a predictive processing operationalization of Sean Kelly's theory of perception. This account explains the 'tensions' and 'pulls' which guide and constrain our action-oriented and affect-laden perceptual 'grip' upon the world to be underwritten by an imperative to minimize prediction error. I then argue that OCD is best understood as 'grip gone awry'- malformed predictive models signal inappropriately high error, and this results in extremely strong 'tensions' and 'pulls' which prescribe (allostatic) actions. Thus, I arrive at the idea that OCD is primarily constituted by 'not just right' feelings caused by high error signaling. Finally, I explain that this account provides a causal explanation of the non-representationalexistential feelingfundamental to OCD. Compulsions are considered manifestations of non-representational grip responsive to this feeling, whilst obsessions are explained to play a meta-role in the condition, being formulated by subjects in a bid to make their 'not just right' feeling intelligible. I explain that the meta-role obsessions play makes their representational status largely irrelevant to OCD, and so leave this an open question. Consequently, I provide a non-representational account of OCD, thereby demonstrating that ecological-enactive approaches can respond to the 'scaling up' objection.

AB  - Soil-test biological activity (STBA) is a key indicator describing the functions of soil to catabolize organic amendments, promote soil organic C sequestration, and cycle nutrients. We explored how climatic zone, land use, and physiographic region affected the relationship of STBA with several soil fertility properties and processes. Soils from Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (wet climate) were Aquults, Fluvents, Udalfs, Udepts, and Udults and soils from Nebraska and Oklahoma (dry climate) were Udolls and Ustolls. Annual cropland and perennial pasture were the land uses. The Prairie region had silt loam and silty clay loams, the Ridge-Valley region had silt loams, and the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions had fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, and sandy loams. Across all locations, STBA with the flush of CO2 during 3 d following rewetting of dried soil was most strongly associated with cumulative C mineralization, basal soil respiration, particulate organic C, potential N mineralization during 24 d of aerobic incubation, residual soil ammonium, soil microbial biomass C, and total soil N. Climatic zone modified the association between STBA and net N mineralization, possibly caused by greater N immobilization in drier soils with 2:1 clays. Physiographic region had a small effect on the relationship between STBA and net N mineralization. Land use did not alter this relationship significantly. Soil-test biological activity was verified as a robust indicator of soil organic N supply, as well as of general soil biological condition to assess the soil's catabolic potential and potential C storage.

AB  - The Mogao Grottoes is famous around the world for its exquisite wall paintings and colorful painted sculptures, and was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1987. Although the site is located in an arid area, water is still one of the main factors threatening the long-term preservation of cultural relics. The relationship between rainfall infiltration and wall painting deterioration was investigated as part of efforts to develop conservation strategies to prevent deterioration caused by atmospheric precipitation. This was done through artificial rainfall simulation experiments and high-density electrical non-destructive test. Areas prone to wall painting deterioration, as evidenced by periodic condition assessment, showed an association between further deterioration and natural heavy rainfall. The results show that the covering layer above the grottoes has a small runoff coefficient, and the rainfall infiltration is much larger than the volume of runoff produced. The rainwater migrates preferentially along the rock fractures in the form of gas or through the gaps between the grotto eaves and the rock, or through cracks in the form of liquid. This is the main mechanism for activation of salt damage and deterioration of the wall paintings. The covering layer above the grottoes is thin, and the through-cracks in the surrounding rock or external wooden eaves are particularly vulnerable to rainfall infiltration. This indicates that more attention should be paid to the system of preventive protection by rainwater disposal. This research has important practical value in improving preventive protection of the Mogao Grottoes.

AB  - Lake ice is a dominant component of Canada's landscape and can act as an indicator for how freshwater aquatic ecosystems are changing with warming climates. While lake ice monitoring through government networks has decreased in the last three decades, the increased availability of remote sensing images can help to provide consistent spatial and temporal coverage for areas with annual ice cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are commonly used for lake ice monitoring, due to the acquisition of images in any condition (time of day or weather). Using Sentinel-1 A/B images, a high-density time series of SAR images was developed for Lake Hazen in Nunavut, Canada, from 2015-2018. These images were used to test two different methods of monitoring lake ice phenology: one method using the first difference between SAR images and another that applies the Otsu segmentation method. Ice phenology dates determined from the two methods were compared with visual interpretation of the Sentinel-1 images. Mean errors for the pixel comparison of the first difference method ranged 3-10 days for ice-on and ice-off, while average error values for the Otsu method ranged 2-10 days. Mean errors for comparisons of different sections of the lake ranged 0-15 days for the first difference method and 2-17 days for the Otsu method. This research demonstrates the value of temporally consistent image acquisition for improving the accuracy of lake ice monitoring.

AB  - The first analyses of carbon and oxygen stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta O-18) on horses of late Pleistocene beds, between 50 and 30 kyr B.P., at mid-latitudes of South America (northern Uruguay), are reported here. Isotopic analyses on Equus neogeus and Hippidion principale were made on tooth enamel, considering the Suess Effect. Isotopic values have been used as indicators of diets and environmental conditions, alongside with Hypsodonty Index, to pinpoint specific feeding strategies as grazer or browser. E. neogeus was a mixed-grazer that fed mostly on C-3 grass in open wooded areas and grasslands with a variable proportion of C-4 grass in the diet. H. principale was a mixed feeder with preference for open canopy wooded floor C-3 grass and plants. These results could explain the co-occurrence of both taxa that evolved a combination of feeding and habitat preferences that resulted in niche differentiation. The isotopic data supports the diversity of habitats previously proposed by other authors and corroborate the environmental context associated to the mammal assemblage in late Pleistocene at these latitudes of South America. Juveniles show delta C-13 depletion and delta O-18 enrichment related to adults. This shift could be explained by maternal effect, owing to gestation and lactation (depleted delta C-13 and enriched delta O-18). The later because breast milk is significantly enriched in delta O-18 in comparison to drinking water and also is not fractionated in the same way as plant-derived carbon. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The main challenge regarding multivariate data is to transform and integrate this information into useful knowledge. In the case of the emerging vehicle as a sensor concept and its application on environmental assessment, the challenge arises from the possibility to board several types of sensors cheaply and, consequently, to gather information in high spatiotemporal frequency. In this sense, the main objective of this article is to categorize urban locations due to pollutants concentration, based on the spatial dependence of regionalized variables into the n-dimensional space, through self-organizing maps (SOM) technique. For this goal, we use a pollution dataset gathered by equipped vehicles in five trips in Sao Paulo, Brazil, comprising the following variables: four gas concentration parameters (carbon monoxide-CO, carbon dioxide-CO2, nitrogen dioxide-NO2, and ozone-O-3), meteorological parameters (temperature and humidity), altitude and speed. As a first result, we obtain the correlation among considered variables. Afterward, we assess the average behavior of each variable considering only the pollutants, interpreted as a pollution signature, for each cluster obtained by SOM technique. Thus, each cluster is classified according to the air pollution signature. As the main result, by visualizing this proposed classification in a Geographic Information System, we relate the air quality to the urban landscape on the surroundings of the samples and to the time of the day when the sample was gathered. Concretely, for the dataset collected in Sao Paulo, the worst air conditions are related to non-green urban areas, large traffic corridors and traffic peak hours.

AB  - Our knowledge of the ability of coral reefs to face contemporary challenges disregards the wide variety of benthic communities (BCs) that could be associated with contrasted dynamics when facing stressors. Accordingly, this study investigates the number, characteristics, and distribution of BCs responsible for the development of coastal three-dimensional structures in Taiwan. A total of 89 transects among three regions (north, east, and south) and two depths (-10 and -40 m) were characterized using a morpho-functional categorization of benthic organisms. Using an unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means cluster, an optimal number of k groups were identified among transects in order to minimize total intra-group variance and represent a first level of organization, mirroring the number of BCs. Each BC was then described into prevailing categories and typified by an association with significant indicator groups. Their distributions were further examined and tested among regions and depths. Seven BCs were identified as having different composition and indicator categories. Their distributions suggest that, while sea surface temperature and light regime may be associated with a panel of available BCs, local conditions may have the final say on whether a BC eventually thrives at a given location. Overall, this study proposes an innovative and simple analytical framework for acknowledging differences among BCs. Our results encourage greater consideration of these shades in coral reef ecology studies, as they could conceal a variety of roles and dynamics important for the conservation of these endangered ecosystems.

AB  - Being awfully harmful to the environment and human health, the sensitive and selective determination of p-dihydroxybenzene (p-DHB) in environmental water is of great significance. However, the similar structures and properties of p-DHB with catechol (CC; one p-DHB isomer) make the selective and reliable determination of p-DHB from CC in environmental waters being still a formidable challenge. In this manuscript, by preparing CC stabilized silicon quantum dots (C-SiQDs) via a simple hydrothermal process and using C-SiQDs simultaneously as a catalyst and fluorescence indicator, a novel nanosensing platform was successfully developed to selectively and sensitively detect p-DHB with double signals: fluorescence and colorimetric. For detecting p-DHB, C-SiQDs could catalyze the oxidation of p-DHB to form benzoquinone (BQ), an intermediate, which lead to the color change from pale yellow to dark brown and the efficient quenching the fluorescence of C-SiQDs. While for CC in samples, it could not contact C-SiQDs surface due to the great steric hindrance effect from CC on quantum dots surface, thus restricting the oxidation of CC and production of BQ, and leading that the obtained C-SiQDs have no response towards CC. Meanwhile, the developed nanosensor could also avoid various other possible interferences. Under optimized conditions, wide linear ranges (from 0.01 mu M to 50.0 mu M) and low detection limits (4.0 nM) were obtained for p-DHB. The simple and reliable C-SiQDs-based double signals proposal demonstrated to be potentially applicable for the highly selective and sensitive detection of trace p-DHB in various environmental water samples.

AB  - Global climate changes are revealing the interconnections between natural conditions, natural resources, and regional climate variability that may affect the rain fluctuation. Rainfall plays an important role in the process of hydrology. This research presents an analysis of rainfall in the lower central plain of Thailand and the climate variability/oceanographic events in the wider geographical region, including the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Data from 1980-2010 and 2011-2014 were collected for calibration and verification. Next, the frequency domains, spectra, and wavelet transforms were analyzed, together with the climate index and rainfall. The results revealed that rainfall occurs in seasons, yearly cycles, and off-seasons. The behavior of ASMs, for example, Indian Summer Monsoon Index (IMI) and Western North Pacific Monsoon Index (WNPMI), is the most similar to that of rainfall events, while the similarity of the other indices to rainfall events is not so strong. Cross-correlation analysis showed that there were delays between the climate indices and rainfall, so that multiple linear regression with lag time is required for further analysis. The results illustrate that the cross-correlation coefficients of IMI and WNPMI with rainfall are both approximately 0.6. The multiple regression with lag time shows that the average multiple coefficient correlation (R) is 0.64. The indicator of the summer monsoon index value is WNPMI, which is the most influential factor for rainfall. Finally, the proposed equations, based on the cross-correlation and multiple-linear regression with lag time techniques, can be used to predict precipitation and be applied to the development of rainfall forecasting in the future.

AB  - Earth's atmospheric composition has changed significantly over geologic time. Many redox active atmospheric constituents have left evidence of their presence, while inert constituents such as dinitrogen gas (N-2) are more elusive. In this study, we examine two potential biological indicators of atmospheric N-2: the morphological and isotopic signatures of heterocystous cyanobacteria. Biological nitrogen fixation constitutes the primary source of fixed nitrogen to the global biosphere and is catalyzed by the oxygen-sensitive enzyme nitrogenase. To protect this enzyme, some filamentous cyanobacteria restrict nitrogen fixation to microoxic cells (heterocysts) while carrying out oxygenic photosynthesis in vegetative cells. Heterocysts terminally differentiate in a pattern that is maintained as the filaments grow, and nitrogen fixation imparts a measurable isotope effect, creating two biosignatures that have previously been interrogated under modern N-2 partial pressure (pN(2)) conditions. Here, we examine the effect of variable pN(2) on these biosignatures for two species of the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena. We provide the first in vivo estimate of the intrinsic isotope fractionation factor of Mo-nitrogenase (epsilon(fix) = -2.71 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand) and show that, with decreasing pN(2), the net nitrogen isotope fractionation decreases for both species, while the heterocyst spacing decreases for Anabaena cylindrica and remains unchanged for Anabaena variabilis. These results are consistent with the nitrogen fixation mechanisms available in the two species. Application of these quantifiable effects to the geologic record may lead to new paleobarometric measurements for pN(2), ultimately contributing to a better understanding of Earth's atmospheric evolution.

AB  - The prescription composition and the technology of a new type of specialized product - biologically active additive BAA have been scientifically grounded. The pharmacological properties and functional orientation of the active principles of the formulation components of the dietary supplements were studied, which made it possible to determine the quantitative and qualitative composition of the ,formulation which has a synergistic effect on metabolic processes in the presence of deforming osteoarthrosis: bamboo extract, glucosamine and chondroitin, aloe vera extracts, leaves and grape seeds, vitamin and mineral composition with green tea extract, and the antioxidant complex "Cifrol-5". A production technology providing high consumer performance for the developed product was approved. Clinical trials involving two groups of women aged 44-49 with deforming osteoarthritis of the knee joints confirmed the functional properties of the complex. The first group received the BAA, the second was a control group. Changes in the control indicators were registered after dietary therapy or in clinically significant periods of patient recovery. The control indicators were joint soreness, skin, hair, and nail condition, and the recovery time of postoperative sutures. The complex application of diet therapy and the basic treatment for dystrophic joint diseases and the rehabilitation measures of the postoperative period were shown to be effective. In patients, joint pain and pain index decreased, the fragility of nails and hair was reduced, the microcirculation of the nail bed improved, and the healing time of the surgical sutures decreased. The consistency of quality indicators and consumer performance was ensured by production certifications for the developed products within the requirements of international standards of the ISO 9001 and 22000 series and GMP rules.

AB  - A variety of fish species show habitat-related variation in traits associated with swimming performance and foraging behavior. This commonly manifests as a distinction between open water and shallow water littoral ecotypes. In bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), open water fish exhibit greater energy economy and speed during sustained locomotion than those from the littoral, whereas littoral fish were more maneuverable than their open water counterparts. These distinctions are associated with variation in diet and foraging behavior and may represent a resource polyphenism that enhances fitness through more effective exploitation of particular habitat types. A lack of field data means that polyphenisms have not been placed in context with swimming behavior in the field. We have used 3D videography to quantify bluegill field swimming performance in open water and littoral habitats. This revealed patterns of performance variation that parallel the trait variation previously established in the laboratory. Open water fish utilized faster average swimming speeds than inshore fish, while indicators of nonlinearity and unsteadiness were greater in the littoral fish. There are, however, differences in propulsive behavior between the field and laboratory. Pectoral-fin-powered, median-paired fin swimming is rarely employed by open water fish. Field body-caudal fin swimming involves short sequences of propulsive tail beats interspersed with gliding, rather than the repeated propulsive cycles employed under steady-state conditions. This suggests a need to re-evaluate the applicability of steady-state performance traits to behavior and fitness in the field and highlights the general importance of obtaining field performance data.

KW  - Environmental Liability Directive
AB  - Motivation: Compulsory insurance is one of the possible optional responses to the Environmental Liability Directive (ELD) call for development of financial instruments. The article is a contribution to the analysis of the development of financial instruments relating to environmental liability. The above has been continuously discussed in both local and European circles.
   Aim: There are two research purposes of this article. Firstly, to identify the attributes of the EU countries which have implemented a system of obligatory environmental insurance. Secondly, to recognise and assess the premises for introduction of a system of obligatory environmental insurance by the example of Poland.
   Results: Insurance obligation has been legitimised in relatively poorly developed countries of the European Union. Economic indicators (GDP, GDP per capita) in majority of the above are usually below the EU average. Also, the attributes of insurance markets (non-life insurance gross premium written, non-life insurance density and insurance penetration rates) in these countries are the evidence of a large discrepancy between them and the highly developed markets. Overall economic indicators for Poland and the attributes of the Polish insurance market put this country (in economic terms) in the group of states which have decided to introduce obligatory environmental insurance. Simultaneously, the doctrine and practitioners alike consistently criticise 'inflation of obligatoriness' which has been seen in the Polish regulations for decades and indicate disadvantages of such solution. Possible introduction of environmental insurance obligation, if considered in Poland, should be preceded by action taken in order to strengthen the supply side of the market. Only in this condition will it be possible for obligatory insurance - if flexible enough in its structure - to strengthen the incentives for market development on the demand side.

AB  - The processes of growth and development of productive animals are inextricably linked to the dynamics of systems that regulate and integrate living organisms, including blood. It is physiologically extremely important its biological subsystem, providing, on the one hand, the preservation of its liquid state, and on the other, prevention and relief of bleeding, is hemostasis. In this regard, the assessment of blood parameters and especially of the elements of hemostasis in productive animals has great practical significance for biology. They are closely related to their somatic characteristics and processes of functioning of the whole organism. The elucidation of their values makes it possible to work out the age norms of these indicators and clearly identify the beginning of the onset of hemostasis. Due to the high productivity of Ayrshire cattle and the patient importance of platelet activity in its young, it was decided to evaluate the aggregation of platelets. Objective: to establish the features of platelet activity in healthy Ayrshire calves during the dairy nutrition phase. A survey of 65 calves feeding the Ayrshire breed using hematological methods of research. The most active platelet aggregation was observed on adenosine diphosphate, which turned out to be maximum by the end of observation. Collagen and ristomitsinovaya aggregation was less pronounced and similar direction, which indirectly indicated the low availability of collagen and a small concentration of von Willebrand factor in it. The disaggregation potential of platelets in response to all tested inductors in calves of the milk feed tended to increase. Low platelet activity in animals of this breed during growth and development provides optimal conditions for the blood supply to growing and ripening organs.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii has a complex life cycle involving different hosts and is dependent on fast responses, as the parasite reacts to changing environmental conditions. T. gondii causes disease by lysing the host cells that it infects and it does this by reiterating its lytic cycle, which consists of host cell invasion, replication inside the host cell, and egress causing host cell lysis. Calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling triggers activation of molecules involved in the stimulation and enhancement of each step of the parasite lytic cycle. Ca2+ signaling is essential for the cellular and developmental changes that support T. gondii parasitism.
   The characterization of the molecular players and pathways directly activated by Ca2+ signaling in Toxoplasma is sketchy and incomplete. The evolutionary distance between Toxoplasma and other eukaryotic model systems makes the comparison sometimes not informative. The advent of new genomic information and new genetic tools applicable for studying Toxoplasma biology is rapidly changing this scenario. The Toxoplasma genome reveals the presence of many genes potentially involved in Ca2+ signaling, even though the role of most of them is not known. The use of Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECIs) has allowed studies on the role of novel calcium-related proteins on egress, an essential step for the virulence and dissemination of Toxoplasma. In addition, the discovery of new Ca2+ players is generating novel targets for drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic tools and a better understanding of the biology of these parasites.

AB  - Compressed Air Systems (CAS) are one of the most common and energy intensive utilities in industry, representing up to 10% of the industrial energy needs. Thus, they can be considered as one of the main target systems while planning energy efficiency actions implementation in industry. Nevertheless, most of the available benchmarks of energy consumption are based on nominal data, thus referring to the quality of the design, while benchmarks based on measurements under actual operating conditions are not yet available.
   In accordance with the Italian transposition of the European Directive 2012/27/EU (i.e. Legislative Decree 102/2014), large and energy-intensive business organizations must perform energy audits at least every four years starting in 2015 and the Italian Energy, New Technology and Environment Agency (ENEA) has the task of collecting and analysing them. In this context, a data collection focused on CAS has been carried out and the subsequent data analysis, focused on nine most promising industrial sectors, has allowed to assess the current state of the art of CAS's energy efficiency in Italy and to design a possible benchmarking system. Such a system is composed of a set of indicators and a benchmarking visual tool in the form of a matrix. In particular, results related to the Manufacturing of basic metals will be presented for sake of brevity. In this paper we present the results obtained from both the data analysis and the first application of the proposed benchmarking system, together with next steps for the creation of reliable sectorial and cross-sectorial benchmarks.

AB  - Background: Today, the effects of environmental pollution on human life and human needs, which reduces the level of community health caused by traffic noise in large cities, are clearly visible by creating irritation and pathogenic conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of noise pollution resulted from central traffic in Shiraz by analyzing its indicators and related components.
   Methods: By specifying the high traffic jam in Shiraz, the sound and its frequency in 156 points of the city were analyzed using a sound analyzer (Tes-1358C model). The sound pressure levels (L-A and L-P) and the one and one-third octave band were continuously measured in A and C networks. Then, data were extracted and analyzed using Excel 2016 and Minitab 18.1. Eventually, phon and sone indexes were calculated for the heavy traffic jam in some of the central streets of Shiraz and the results were statistically calculated and their charts were prepared with comfort disturbance ranges.
   Results: The highest harmful frequency of traffic in Shiraz was 50 Hz and 83.3 dB. The sound pressure level ranged from 70 to 92.7 dB in network A and 87.8 dB in network C. The maximum sound level was 87 phon and the maximum sone was 26 at 14 stations.
   Conclusion: According to the results, the sound pressure levels exceeded the environmental standards of Iran and the values of phon and sone were higher than the standard of comfort at night and day.

AB  - With rapid growth in the demand of location-based services (LBS) in indoor environments, localizations based on fingerprinting have attracted significant interest due to their convenience. Until now, most such methods were based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), which is vulnerable to non-line-of-sight (NLOS). In order to realize high-precision indoor positioning, we propose a channel state information (CSI)-based Amp-Phi indoor-positioning system which exploits the amplitude and phase information of CSI at the same time to establish a fingerprinting database. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the raw CSI information collected at different positions under different environments, we build an NLOS mitigation model and a phase error mitigation model, respectively, to process the amplitude and phase of CSI. Secondly, we analyze the statistical characteristics of CSI carefully, including maximum, minimum, mean and variance. After being processed with the models, the CSI features can be used to distinguish different positions clearly, which provides a theoretical basis for the indoor positioning based on fingerprinting. Finally, we build a fingerprinting database based on the features of amplitude and phase, realize to locate the targets position with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) matching algorithm. Experiments implemented in different situations show that Amp-Pi system is reliable and robust, whose position accuracy is higher than that of PhaseFi, Horus and machine learning (ML) systems under the same condition. It can be used in many scenarios, such as the localization of robots in our daily life, by doctors or patients in the hospital, for people localization in large supermarkets or museums and so on.

AB  - Risk contagion concerns any entity dealing with large scale risks. Suppose Z = (Z(1), Z(2)) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A relevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of influence of high values of Z(2) on Z(1). This can be measured in a variety of ways. In this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E((Z(1) - t)(+) vertical bar Z(2) > t} called Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E(Z(1) vertical bar Z(2) > t) called Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of risk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance, insurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under the assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and asymptotic tail independence for the risk vector Z. Many broad and useful model classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive the asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t -> infinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in the models, MME and MES converge to infinity under very general conditions; this reflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains significant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators we introduce an extrapolation method based on extreme-value theory to estimate both MME and MES for high thresholds t where little data are available. We show that these estimators are consistent and illustrate our methodology in both simulated and real data sets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exposure to pesticides by nontarget soil biota has long been regarded as a serious downside of modern agricultural regimes and the subject of heated debate. Of utmost relevance is the exposure to pesticide mixtures because their effects have been shown to not necessarily reflect the individual toxicity of their components, and even the simple addition of effects may lead to consequences not clearly anticipated. In the present study, a multiple biomarker approach was employed to identify the mechanistic and time effects underlying several single and mixture treatments of chlorpyrifos (CPF) and mancozeb (MCZ) in juveniles and adults of the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus. The effects of the individual pesticides and the mixtures at recommended doses were mostly transitory under these controlled conditions and one-pulse exposure. Whereas imbalances were identified on detoxification and oxidative stress-related enzymes, the isopods generally showed the ability to recover through the end of the experiment. However, juveniles displayed greater vulnerability than adults. Most of the differences between life stages occurred in energy-related parameters where distinct performances and stress-handling behaviors were observed, suggesting higher metabolic costs to juveniles. Our results stress that understanding the time dependence of the underlying mechanisms governing the joint effects of the pesticides can help in assessing and anticipating the effects of the pesticide mixtures. Moreover, we emphasize the importance of taking life stage-related differences into consideration when evaluating the environmental risks of pesticides and pesticide mixtures. (C) 2018 SETAC.

AB  - The world is experiencing high rates of urbanisation and it has slowly become an alarming social process, especially in developing countries. This has demanded an urgent investigation on human thermal comfort, especially in tropical climates. In this study, a surrogate human sensor (SHS) was developed to establish a linkage between human skin surface and SHS with the surrounding environments. Black plastic corrugated cardboard was used in the SHS fabrication as its thermal conductivity was close to the thermal conductivity and emissivity of the human epidermal skin layer. The SHS was designed to correlate with human skin surface temperature and a regression model was developed. The regression equation was obtained for the human skin temperature prediction (T-h) by using SHS. Statistical analysis of the ANOVA (F = 13,700;. rho<0.05) was significantly tested to show its reliability. The predicted and measured human skin temperature was compared and the results revealed that both temperature variations was found in range +/- 0.5 degrees C in temperature differences. The advantages of SHS as the sensor for the impact of thermal behaviour can be identified by observing the temperature difference as it can directly reflects the influences from the surrounding outdoor environment. Although it is proven valid statistically, however, SHS is only relevant as an initial indicator to investigate the impacts of thermal behaviour and discomfort level. It can further used to measure human thermal comfort by correlating surrounding environment condition with comfort sensation through SHS regression model.

AB  - Application of wood ash to forest soils is used to counteract acidification and to reintroduce nutrients otherwise lost by harvesting, particularly in silvicultural systems with intensified biomass removal. pH governs many essential processes like nutrient availability for plant uptake, heavy metal mobility and ecosystem functioning in forest soil, but changes in soil pH on a micro scale after ash application have not been reported. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate micro vertical changes in soil pH and base cations over time after application of wood ash on forest soil. A column experiment with repacked O- and A-horizon forest soil was constructed and treatments of 0, 3 and 9 t wood ash ha(-1) were applied on top of the soil in replicates of three. Soil cores were extracted from the columns monthly over one year for pH micro sensor measurements of O- and A-horizon (0-5 cm soil depth) and at four occasions (62, 152, 278 and 363 days after treatment) additional soil cores were extracted for base cation analysis. Results showed that ash application creates strong pH gradients ranging from pH 11 to 4.5 within the top 1-1.5 cm of the soil, with the highest variation within the first 50 days after application. Application of ash increases the nutrient availability. If micro scale variation is not considered, mean pH values can be a misleading indicator for the extreme conditions that can exists in the top part of the soil after ash application.

AB  - Background: Increasing evidence shows the importance of the commensal microbe Oxalobacter formigenes in regulating host oxalate homeostasis, with effects against calcium oxalate kidney stone formation, and other oxalate-associated pathological conditions. However, limited understanding of O. formigenes in humans poses difficulties for designing targeted experiments to assess its definitive effects and sustainable interventions in clinical settings. We exploited the large-scale dataset from the American Gut Project (AGP) to study O. formigenes colonization in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and to explore O. formigenes-associated ecology and the underlying host-microbe relationships.
   Results: In > 8000 AGP samples, we detected two dominant, co-colonizing O. formigenes operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in fecal specimens. Multivariate analysis suggested that O. formigenes abundance was associated with particular host demographic and clinical features, including age, sex, race, geographical location, BMI, and antibiotic history. Furthermore, we found that O. formigenes presence was an indicator of altered host gut microbiota structure, including higher community diversity, global network connectivity, and stronger resilience to simulated disturbances.
   Conclusions: Through this study, we identified O. formigenes colonizing patterns in the human GI tract, potential underlying host-microbe relationships, and associated microbial community structures. These insights suggest hypotheses to be tested in future experiments. Additionally, we proposed a systematic framework to study any bacterial taxa of interest to computational biologists, using large-scale public data to yield novel biological insights.

AB  - The ability to acquire water from the soil is a major driver in interspecific plant competition and it depends on several root functional traits. One of these traits is the excretion of gel-like compounds (mucilage) that modify physical soil properties. Mucilage secreted by roots becomes hydrophobic upon drying, impedes the rewetting of the soil close to the root, the so called rhizosphere, and reduces water availability to plants. The function of rhizosphere hydrophobicity is not easily understandable when looking at a single plant, but it may constitute a competitive advantage at the ecosystem level. We hypothesize that by making the top soil hydrophobic, deep-rooted plants avoid competititon with shallow-rooted plants. To test this hypothesis we used an individual-based model to simulate water uptake and growth of two virtual plant species, one deep-rooted plant capable of making the soil hydrophobic and a shallow-rooted plant. We ran scenarios with different precipitation regimes ranging from dry to wet (350, 700, and 1400 mm total annual precipitation) and from high to low precipitation frequencies (1, 7, and 14 days). Plant species abundance and biomass were chosen as indicators for competitiveness of plant species. At constant precipitation frequency mucilage hydrophobicity lead to a benefit in biomass and abundance of the tap-rooted population. Under wet conditions this effect diminished and tap-rooted plants were less productive. Without this trait both species coexisted. The effect of root exudation trait remained constant under different precipitation frequencies. This study shows that mucilage secretion is a competitive trait for the acquisition of water. This advantage is achieved by the modification of the soil hydraulic properties and specifically by inducing water repellency in soil regions which are shared with other species.

AB  - The purpose of this study has been to describe test procedures for measuring the (sub)chronic effects of chemicals on the freshwater cyclopoid Eucyclops serrulatus. To this end we have adapted the setting of the standard full life-cycle protocol of the marine harpacticoid A. tenuiremis to E. serrulatus. We have tested the effects of 4 different diets, two temperatures and two rearing volumes on the survival, development, reproduction and population growth rates of this species. Our results have highlighted that full life-cycle tests can be run using 2 mL-glass vials, a diet consisting of a mixture of living cells of Chlorella sorokiniana and Scenedesmus quadricauda, at either 25 degrees C (test duration: 42 days) or 18 degrees C (test duration: 51 days). However, the best performance in terms of survival, development, reproducibility and population growth rates with this species was obtained at 18 degrees C, albeit with significantly longer test duration. Subchronic tests in 2 mL-glass vials with the mixture microalgal diet at both temperatures are available options if considered appropriate for the objectives of a given study. In particular, developmental tests from nauplius to copepodid may profitably be performed in about 11 days at 18 degrees C and in 6 days at 25 degrees C. Under the same test conditions, subchronic tests from copepodid to adult may be run in 19 days at 18 degrees C and in 16 days at 25 degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Greatest potential, QTLs for hypoxia and waterlogging tolerance in soybean roots were detected using a new phenotypic evaluation method.
   Waterlogging is a major environmental stress limiting soybean yield in wet parts of the world. Root development is an important indicator of hypoxia tolerance in soybean. However, little is known about the genetic control of root development under hypoxia. This study was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for root development under hypoxia. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between a hypoxia-sensitive cultivar, Tachinagaha, and a tolerant landrace, Iyodaizu, were used. Seedlings were subjected to hypoxia, and root development was evaluated with the value change in root traits between after and before treatments. We found 230 polymorphic markers spanning 2519.2 cM distributed on all 20 chromosomes (Chrs.). Using these, we found 11 QTLs for root length (RL), root length development (RLD), root surface area (RSA), root surface area development (RSAD), root diameter (RD), and change in average root diameter (CARD) on Chrs. 11, 12, 13 and 14, and 7 QTLs for hypoxia tolerance of these root traits. These included QTLs for RLD and RSAD between markers Satt052 and Satt302 on Chr. 12, which are important markers of hypoxia tolerance in soybean; those QTLs were stable between 2 years. To validate the QTLs, we developed a near-isogenic line with the QTL region derived from Iyodaizu. The line performed well under both hypoxia and waterlogging, suggesting that the region contains one or more genes with large effects on root development. These findings may be useful for fine mapping and positional cloning of gene responsible for root development under hypoxia.

AB  - Denitrification is one of the main biological sources of N2O, a greenhouse gas. In paddies, water flooding provides anaerobic soil conditions that can boost denitrification. In this work, the influences of rice cultivar, water management and soil type on the abundance and community structure of denitrifying bacteria were evaluated; nirS and nirK-type denitrifiers were considered separately. Two microcosm experiments were performed, and the abundance and community structure for both nitrite reductase genes were assessed using qPCR and T-RFLP, respectively. In the first experiment, two rice cultivars and two water managements were evaluated; in the second experiment, two soils, which mainly differed in their organic matter content, and two flooding times were evaluated. The results show that sampling time was the main factor driving nirS and nirK abundances. The nirK:nirS ratio, recently proposed as an indicator of the soil N2O emission potential, was higher in samples taken at the flower primordium stage of rice in both experiments, suggesting that this stage could be a hot moment for N2O emissions. Soil type was the main factor influencing the nirS community structure, while it had no effect on nirK communities. Although the nirK community structure was not affected by cultivar or soil type, statistical analysis showed that some T-RFs were associated with each cultivar or soil type, indicating that these factors exerted effects on certain subsets of the denitrifying population rather than the whole community. The community structure of firs-type denitrifiers was more sensitive to the analyzed factors than the nirK-type, and soil type was the main factor that influenced this community structure.

AB  - The importance of E. coli as an indicator organism in fresh water has led to numerous studies focusing on cell properties and transport behavior. However, previous studies have been unable to assess if differences in E. coli cell surface properties and genomic variation are associated with different environmental habitats. In this study, we investigated the variation in characteristics of E. coli obtained from stream water and stream bottom sediments. Cell properties were measured for 77 genomically different E. coli strains (44 strains isolated from sediments and 33 strains isolated from water) under common stream conditions in the Upper Midwestern United States: pH 8.0, ionic strength 10 mM and 22 degrees C. Measured cell properties include hydrophobicity, zeta potential, net charge, total acidity, and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) composition. Our results indicate that stream sediment E. coli had significantly greater hydrophobicity, greater EPS protein content and EPS sugar content, less negative net charge, and higher point of zero charge than stream water E. coli. A significant positive correlation was observed between hydrophobicity and EPS protein for stream sediment E. coli but not for stream water E. coli. Additionally, E. coli surviving in the same habitat tended to have significantly larger (GTG)5 genome similarity. After accounting for the intrinsic impact from the genome, environmental habitat was determined to be a factor influencing some cell surface properties, such as hydrophobicity. The diversity of cell properties and its resulting impact on particle interactions should be considered for environmental fate and transport modeling of aquatic indicator organisms such as E. coli.

AB  - The South American monsoon system (SAMS) plays a fundamental role in the precipitation regime of the most populous and economically important regions in Brazil. The South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) is a main component of the SAMS, characterizing its active phase, and is often associated with intense rainfall events: Strong and persistent episodes cause severe floods and landslides, while weak and sparse episodes are associated with droughts. The variability of the convergence zone caused great natural disasters in Southeast Brazil, associated with extreme precipitation conditions: 3562 landslides killed 947 people in Rio de Janeiro state in 2011, while a shortage of water in So Paulo affected around 20 million people between 2014 and 2015. In the present study, we build SACZ configuration series for the period between January 2000 and June 2014 and use them as indicators for the SAMS to quantify its influence on several atmospheric variables. Based on a principal component analysis, we present indices that identify the configuration of the SACZ in a local scale. The indices reached strong accuracy rates, especially for identifying days of extreme rainfall events associated with the SAMS and may, thus, serve as decision-making tools to help prepare for their impacts. Furthermore, the indices are composed by common variables simulated by numerical weather and climate models, other than precipitation, which is often a not very reliable output. The applied methodology is easily reproducible and different variables may be used to compose indices for different regions-an advantage of this local-scale approach.

AB  - This research work was focused on the establishment and performance assessment of the locally designed pro-type pilot-scale stone-media trickling biofilter (TBF) system for the removal of pollution indicators (chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and pathogen indicators) from municipal wastewater under increasing environmental temperature of 20-40.5 degrees C for 40d. The results indicated that removal efficiency of the parameters, COD, BOD5, and NH4-N, from the wastewater considerably increased from 62.4, 56.4, and 33.8%, respectively, at 20 degrees C on 1st day to 98.1, 98.6, and 93.5%, respectively, at 40.5 degrees C on 40th day of the TBF operation. The removal of pathogenic indicators from wastewater was evaluated in terms of MPN index and an average reduction of 88.8% of fecal coliforms in the effluent was recorded during the experimental period. The biofilms, which were responsible for wastewater treatment, were sampled from the top and deeper layers of stone bed of the reactor and were characterized. The Nitrosonomas and Nitrobacter sp. were identified in the deeper layers of the biofilms, while 13 bacterial strains viz. E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. aerogenes, S. typhimurium, P. vulgaris, S. dysenteriae, K. pnuemoniae, B. subtilis, S. aureus, M. luteus, S. epidermitus, S. lactis, and C. xerosis were identified in the biofilm sample removed from top layer of the stone media. The overall results proved that the pilot-scale TBF has a great potential to be transferred to field scale for treating sewage for small communities in developing and underdeveloped countries even at extreme temperature conditions.

AB  - Transgenic plants with improved salt and drought stress tolerance have been developed with a large number of abiotic stress-related genes. Among these, the most extensively used genes are the glycine betaine biosynthetic codA, the DREB transcription factors, and vacuolar membrane Na+/H+ antiporters. The use of codA, DREBs, and Na+/H+ antiporters in transgenic plants has conferred stress tolerance and improved plant phenotype. However, the future deployment and commercialization of these plants depend on their safety to the environment. Addressing environmental risk assessment is challenging since mechanisms governing abiotic stress tolerance are much more complex than that of insect resistance and herbicide tolerance traits, which have been considered to date. Therefore, questions arise, whether abiotic stress tolerance genes need additional considerations and new measurements in risk assessment and, whether these genes would have effects on weediness and invasiveness potential of transgenic plants? While considering these concerns, the environmental risk assessment of abiotic stress tolerance genes would need to focus on the magnitude of stress tolerance, plant phenotype and characteristics of the potential receiving environment. In the present review, we discuss environmental concerns and likelihood of concerns associated with the use of abiotic stress tolerance genes. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the uses of these genes in domesticated crop plants are safe for the environment. Risk assessment, however, should be carefully conducted on biofeedstocks and perennial plants taking into account plant phenotype and the potential receiving environment.

AB  - Objectives. Famine can be defined as a shortage of foodstuffs that instigates widespread excess mortality due to starvation, infectious disease, and social disruption. Like other causes of catastrophic mortality, famine has the potential to be selective. This study examines how famines in medieval London were selective with respect to previous stress, age, and sex,
   Methods: This study compares famine burials to nonfamine (attritional) burials from the St Mary Spital cemetery, London (c. 1120-1540 AD). We evaluate the associations between age, sex, and skeletal stress indicators [cribra orbitalia, linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), and periosteal lesions' using hierarchical log-linear analysis. Additionally, sex is modeled as a covariate affecting the Gompertz hazard of mortality,
   Results: Significant associations exist between famine burials and LEH and between attritional burials and periosteal lesions, independent of age or sex. Sex did not significantly affect risk of mortality in the 12th-13th centuries. However, males interred in attritional burials c, 1400-1539 AD faced a lower risk of mortality compared to females,
   Discussion: The LEH results suggest that early exposure to stressors increased frailty in the context of famine. The periosteal lesion results suggest that individuals were more likely to survive stressors and thus form these lesions under nonfamine conditions. Hazard analysis suggests that a cultural or biological transformation during this period affected sex differences in mortality. Possible causes include the selective mortality during the Black Death, which might have influenced risks of mortality among survivors, or unequal distribution of improvements in standards of living after the epidemic.

AB  - Novel biologically active 3-amino-2-(3,5-di-tert-buthyl-4-hydroxyphenil)-1,4-naPhthoquinones were obtained by reaction of 3-chloro-2-(3,5-di-tert-buthyl-4-hydroxyphenil)-1,4-naphthoquinone with various amines and amino acids. Compounds were characterized with standard methods of chemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques. Synthesis of a series 3 -amino- and 3-amino acid-2-(3,5-di-tert-buthyl-4-hydroxyphenil)-1,4-naphthoquinones demonstrated feasibility to conduct reactions in mild conditions providing relatively high yields in simple procedure and low time costs. Both fungicidal and antibacterial activity of these novel compounds were tested on agar embedded cultures of the following bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium luteum and fungi Candida tenuis, Aspergillus niger by using standard method. It was found that substances 4a, 4b, 4d, 5a, 5b had moderate antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus, M luteum. Compound 5d showed strong effect on M luteum with the minimum bacteriostatic concentration of 62.5 mg/ml. The culture of Gram-negative bacteria E. coli proved resistance against compounds 5a-d, however compounds 4a-d demonstrated moderate bactericidal activity against E. coli. The synthesized compounds 4a-d and 5a-d showed fungicidal effect on the growth of yeasts C. tenuis, but did not prevent growth of A. niger. Some of tested compounds showed significant inhibitory effect on receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). In particular, compounds 5a and 5e inhibited tyrosine kinase activity by 57 and 51%, respectively. More powerful inhibitory effect of 75% was observed for compound 4a. Found that compounds 5b and 5c inhibit oxidative processes in tissues and some indicators of antioxidant action exceeded quercetin results.

AB  - Long-term trends in contaminant exposure were examined in eggs of two aquatic-feeding species, the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) and the Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina), collected from locations within the Hamilton Harbour Area of Concern, an industrialized area historically associated with high concentrations of legacy persistent organic pollutants, metals and other compounds. Significant declines in concentrations of sum polychlorinated biphenyls, four organochlorine pesticides and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were evident in Herring Gull eggs collected from nesting colonies within the harbour (range in % declines = 86%-94%) and in Snapping Turtle eggs from two area of concern wetland/creek locations (range in % declines = 36%-89%) from the 1980s to 2012. Temporal trends in polychlorinated biphenyl congener profiles in eggs were examined by grouping polychlorinated biphenyl congeners according to structure-activity relationships based on their susceptibility to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Significant temporal changes in the percentages of nonmetabolizable congeners (i.e. increase) and congeners metabolized by P450 1A enzymes (i.e. decrease) were evident in eggs of both species. It is not clear if these distinct temporal patterns are related to changes in metabolism following reductions in polychlorinated biphenyl burdens or changes in bioavailability of congeners in the environment. Large decreases in contaminant burdens in eggs of these two species at two different geographic scales within the area of concern (i.e. local scale for Turtles and regional scale for Gulls) are reflective of improved environmental conditions within the harbour and support their utility as top-predator wildlife bio-indicator species.

AB  - Understanding the response of tropical plant communities to human disturbance is critical for conserving biodiversity in a changing world. Here we examine the shifts experienced by understory herb-assemblages while inhabiting small forest fragments in a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape to infer about community-level shifts imposed by either habitat loss or fragmentation. We established 100 25-m(2) plots, placed randomly in 10 forest fragments and 10 forest interior patches, in which all herb species were recorded, litter accumulation, soil temperature and moisture were estimated. We recorded a total of 6027 herbs belonging to 134 species, with a predominance of ferns, grasses, aroids, sedges and calatheas. Forest fragments and forest interior exhibited similar densities of herbs: 64.4 57.8 herbs/25 m(2) vs. 56.1 44.1, respectively. Species richness was reduced by a half in forest fragments at plot and habitat spatial scales. Fragments were particularly impoverished in terms of ferns, aroids and calatheas, but supported a subset of proliferating native herbs and indicator/exclusive species; i.e. a taxonomically and ecologically distinct herb flora. Fragments also supported less humid soils covered by a thicker litter layer and these attributes correlated to species distributions in both forest habitats. Our results suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly the-establishment of illuminated and desiccated forest edges, result in the extirpation of particular ecological groups with a few species/ecological groups experiencing proliferation, such as light-demanding species. Collectively, these processes result in impoverished/altered assemblages at multiple spatial scales, potentially limiting the conservation services provided by humanmodified landscapes.

AB  - The main trends in changes in the global vascular plant biodiversity are generally considered to be a decrease in rare indigenous species and a spread of invasive plants. In the present paper, the impact of these changes on the flora of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg (Southwest-Germany) is examined. The data come from a regional floristic mapping project, which consists of two consecutive surveys, dating from 1970 to 1998 and from 2005 to present. In contrast to many other studies, not only a part of the flora or of an ecosystem was studied but the entire vascular plant flora of a region. As the recent survey is not yet completed, samples of 46 out of 1100 grid cells are analysed as a preliminary study on the trends in entire Baden-Wurttemberg. In the present paper we address the issues (1) whether changes in biodiversity observed in other studies, e.g. decrease of rare native species and increase of invasives, affect the flora of Baden-Wurttemberg, (2) which abiotic factors, i.e. climatic or soil conditions, cause these changes of species diversity.
   The analysis of the two consecutive surveys revealed a continuing decrease of rare native species and a constant increase of neophytes, thus reflecting the global trends. Many extinction events happened before 1970, some already in the 19th century. Changes in land use and urbanisation of former rural regions are two important factors for these changes. A statistic analysis using Ellenberg indicator values revealed the nitrogen input from agriculture and the effects of global warming as further potential causes for these trends.

AB  - Chronic concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been commonly detected in international estuaries ecosystems. Reliable indicators still need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of PAHs in fish. After an in vivo chronic exposure to hydrocarbons, the enzymatic activity of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax. A total of 45 fish were exposed to the water-soluble fraction of Arabian crude oil, similar to a complex pollution by hydrocarbons chronically observed in situ, while 45 other control fish sustained the same experimental conditions in clean seawater. Fish samples were made after a 21-day exposure period and after a 15-day recovery period in clean fresh water. Throughout the experiment, liver EROD activity was significantly higher in contaminated fish than in control fish. In addition, nonenzymatic (total glutathione) and enzymatic (GPx, SOD, and CAT) antioxidant defense parameters measured in liver were not significantly different in fish. Furthermore, in gills, glutathione content had significantly increased while SOD activity had significantly decreased in contaminated fish compared to controls. On the other hand, CAT and GPx activities were not affected. Chronic exposure to PAHs disturbing the first step (SOD) and inhibiting the second step (GPx and CAT) could induce oxidative stress in tissues by the formation of oxygen radicals. After the postexposure period, there was no significant difference between control and contaminated fish in any of the antioxidant defense parameters measured in gills, attesting to the reversibility of the effects.

AB  - Sixty crude oils from the Termit Basin (Eastern Niger) were analysed using biomarker distributions and bulk stable carbon isotopic compositions. Comprehensive oil-to-oil correlation indicates that there are two distinct families in the Termit Basin. The majority of the oils are geochemically similar and characterized by low Pr/Ph (pristane to phytane ratios) and high gammacerane/C-30 hopane ratios, small amounts of C-24 tetracyclic terpanes but abundant C-23 tricyclic terpane, and lower delta C-13 values for saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions. All of these geochemical characteristics indicate possible marine sources with saline and reducing depositional environments. In contrast, oils from well DD-1 have different geochemical features. They are characterized by relatively higher Pr/Ph and lower gammacerane/C30 hopane ratios, higher amounts of C-24 tetracyclic terpane but a low content of C-23 tricyclic terpane, and relatively higher delta C-13 values for saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions. These geochemical signatures indicate possible lacustrine sources deposited under freshwater, suboxic-oxic conditions. This oil family also has a unique biomarker signature in that there are large amounts of C-30 4 alpha-methylsteranes indicating a freshwater lacustrine depositional environment.
   The maturity of the Termit oils is assessed using a number of maturity indicators based on biomarkers, alkyl naphthalenes, alkyl phenanthrenes and alkyl dibenzothiophenes. All parameters indicate that all of the oils are generated by source rocks within the main phase of the oil generation stage with equivalent vitrinite reflectance of 0.58%-0.87%.

AB  - Pollutant effects on biofilm physiology are difficult to assess due to differential susceptibility of species and difficulty separating individual species for analysis. Also, measuring whole assemblage responses such as metabolism can mask species-specific responses, as some species may decrease and others increase metabolic activity. Physiological responses can add information to compositional data, and may be a more sensitive indicator of effect. It is difficult, however, to separate individual species for biochemical analyses. Agricultural runoff often contains multiple pollutants that may alter algal assemblages in receiving waters. It is unclear how mixtures containing potential algal growth stimulators and inhibitors (e.g., nutrients and herbicides) alter algal assemblage structure and function. In research presented here, algal biofilms were exposed to nutrients, atrazine, and their mixtures, and assemblage-level structural and functional changes were measured. Synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy (IMS) was used to isolate the biochemical changes within individual cells from a dominant species of a green alga (Mougeotia sp.), a diatom (Navicula sp.), and a cyanobacterium (Hapalosiphon sp.). At the assemblage level, mixtures generally increased algal biovolume, decreased chlorophyll a, and had no effect on metabolism or ammonium uptake. Navicula had a strong negative response to atrazine initially, but later was more affected by nutrients. Hapalosiphon responded positively to both atrazine and nutrients, and Mougeotia did not exhibit any biochemical trends. Generally, biochemical changes in each species were similar to cells experiencing low stress conditions, with increased relative protein and decreased relative lipid. IMS provided direct evidence that individual species in a natural biofilm can have unique responses to atrazine, nutrients, and mixtures. Results suggest that the initial benthic community composition should have a strong influence on the overall impact of agricultural pollutants.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is an indicator of elevated cardiovascular risk. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the predominant cell type involved in medial vascular calcification, can undergo phenotypic transition to both osteoblastic and chondrocytic cells within a calcifying environment.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, using in vitro VSMC calcification studies in conjunction with ex vivo analyses of a mouse model of medial calcification, we show that vascular calcification is also associated with the expression of osteocyte phenotype markers. As controls, the terminal differentiation of murine calvarial osteoblasts into osteocytes was induced in vitro in the presence of calcifying medium (containing beta-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid), as determined by increased expression of the osteocyte markers DMP-1, E11 and sclerostin. Culture of murine aortic VSMCs under identical conditions confirmed that the calcification of these cells can also be induced in similar calcifying medium. Calcified VSMCs had increased alkaline phosphatase activity and PiT-1 expression, which are recognized markers of vascular calcification. Expression of DMP-1, E11 and sclerostin was up-regulated during VSMC calcification in vitro. Increased protein expression of E11, an early osteocyte marker, and sclerostin, expressed by more mature osteocytes was also observed in the calcified media of Enpp1 2/2 mouse aortic tissue.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study has demonstrated the up-regulation of key osteocytic molecules during the vascular calcification process. A fuller understanding of the functional role of osteocyte formation and specifically sclerostin and E11 expression in the vascular calcification process may identify novel potential therapeutic strategies for clinical intervention.

AB  - Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from surface coatings have caused growing public concern for air quality. Even the low-emitted VOC impact from water-based paints on indoor. air quality in urban areas has caused concern. This paper presents experimental data using a mathematical model to simulate dynamic VOC emissions from water-based paints that is based on mass transfer and molecular diffusion theories. A series of field-analogous experiments were carried out to continuously measure the VOCs emitted from two typical water-based paints using a gas chromatography flame-ionization detector monitor in an artificial wind tunnel system. In the study cases, the mass flux of VOCs emitted from the water-based paints was up to 50 mu g/m(2)sec. It was found that the time needed to completely emit VOCs from water-based paints is just hundreds of seconds. However, the order of magnitude of the VOC emission rate from water-based paints is not lower than that from some dry building materials and solvent-based paints. The experimental data were used to produce a useful semiempirical correlation to estimate the VOC emission rates for water-based paints. This correlation is valid under appropriate conditions as suggested by this work with a statistical deviation of +/- 7.6%. With this correlation, it seems feasible to predict the dynamic emission rates for VOCs during a painting process. This correlation is applicable for assessing the hazardous air pollutant impact on indoor air quality or for environmental risk assessment. Associated with the dynamic VOC emission characterization, the air-exchange rate effect on the VOC emission rates is also discussed.

AB  - Turgor pressure provides a sensitive indicator for irrigation scheduling. Leaf turgor pressure of Musa acuminate was measured by using the so-called leaf patch clamp pressure probe, i.e. by application of an external, magnetically generated and constantly retained clamp pressure to a leaf patch and determination of the attenuated output pressure Pp that is highly correlated with the turgor pressure. Real-time recording of Pp values was made using wireless telemetric transmitters, which send the data to a receiver base station where data are logged and transferred to a GPRS modem linked to an Internet server. Probes functioned over several months under field and laboratory conditions without damage to the leaf patch. Measurements showed that the magnetic-based probe could monitor very sensitively changes in turgor pressure induced by changes in microclimate (temperature, relative humidity, irradiation and wind) and irrigation. Irrigation effects could clearly be distinguished from environmental effects. Interestingly, oscillations in stomatal aperture, which occurred frequently below turgor pressures of 100 kPa towards noon at high transpiration or at high wind speed, were reflected in the Pp values. The period of pressure oscillations was comparable with the period of oscillations in transpiration and photosynthesis. Multiple probe readings on individual leaves and/or on several leaves over the entire height of the plants further emphasised the great impact of this non-invasive turgor pressure sensor system for elucidating the dynamics of short-and long-distance water transport in higher plants.

AB  - Forests that encompass the border triangle of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia currently suffer from centuries of inadequate forest management strategies. including overexploitation during the countries' respective communist regimes and high stress levels due to airborne emissions from heavy industry. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, each country has approached forest monitoring, protection and the improvement of forest conditions in its own way. Spaceborne remote sensing of forest changes across country borders offers great potential for better understanding the underlying drivers of change and for developing comparable indicators between countries.
   For this paper we evaluated how forests changed in the border region of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia between 1987 and 2005 and how these changes depended on industrial transformations before and after 1989. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to assess forest cover change between 1987 and 2005. Our results showed that 8.12% of the forest stands in our study region were degraded either partially or completely during that time period, a percentage that equals 14,972 ha of the area's total forest cover. At the same time, 7.57% (13,951 ha) of the area were reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands. Forest changes were similar in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but differed in Poland. Comparing forest composition, topography, and aspect with forest decline revealed the importance of forest management and pollution legacies from communist times when explaining today's forest disturbance patterns.

AB  - We isolated a clone, named Si69, from a foxtail millet immature seed cDNA library. The protein encoded by Si69 contains a conserved Wali7 (wheat aluminum induced protein 7) domain and shares high-level homology with aluminum-induced proteins from other species including rice and Arabidopsis. The Si69 gene presents as a single locus in foxtail millet genome and is globally expressed in all tissues examined. Its expression is up-regulated by aluminum. The sequence feature and expression pattern suggest that the Si69 gene is involved in aluminum tolerance or detoxification. To confirm its biological functions, Si69 controlled by the CaMV35S promoter was introduced into Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants did not show any visible morphological changes compared to wild-type plants under normal growth conditions. However, when treated with 20 or 50 mu mol/L Aluminum (Al), the root apices of wild-type plants were heavily stained by hematoxylin, whereas those of Si69 transgenic plants were not stained when treated with 20 mu mol/L Al and slightly stained when treated with 50 mu mol/L Al. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results further demonstrated that the damage of the root apices was severer in wild-type plants than in transgenic plants. Inhibition of root growth and accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were lower in transgenic plants than in wild-type plants. The results show that overexpression of Si69 may increase Al tolerance in transgenic plants, indicating that a series of Wali7-containing genes may play similar roles in Al tolerance/detoxification.

AB  - During three years (2005-2007), small-plot field experiments with winter wheat and spring barley were carried out in the Czech Republic at two locations differing in soil and climatic conditions. Variants with contrast stand structure (different seed rates and N rates) were investigated during stem elongation. Analyses involved determination of individual plants and tillers, above-ground biomass and nitrogen uptake. Two types of relationships were observed as reaction to the level of sources and its effect as stress factor - relationships among plants which are more or less of a random nature and intra-plant relationships dependent on the hierarchic structure of plants. Plant responses were reflected in variability of their tillers. A higher inter-plant competition was expressed by lower values of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the plant weight and the number of tillers per plant. On the other hand, intra-plant competition increased values of the CV of the shoot weight. During stem elongation, the differentiation of tillers into two groups, i.e. vegetative and potentially productive, take place. This was accelerated by the lack of nitrogen or by a higher plant density. The separation of shoots into two groups enabled to determine the proportion of the potentially productive biomass in the total above-ground biomass. A low variability of this proportion (CV ranged from 7.06 to 15.79 % and from 7.37 to 17.46 % for winter wheat and spring barley, respectively) gives a possibility to use it as the indicator of the effectiveness of inputs and of a crop productive potential. These may contribute to the development of more efficient methods for canopy control and assessment of stress factors by using canopy spectral characteristics.

AB  - Mapping of the nutrient content and isotopic composition of the native, rooted, green macroalga Caulerpa prolifera and the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa was conducted in the summer of 2006 within the inner Bay of Cadiz, SW Spain. Isotope values of suspended solids from aquaculture (delta N-15 = 9 +/- 0.88) and urban effluent (delta N-15 = 7 +/- 1.97) were similar to the isotopic composition of the macrophytes (delta N-15 range 3.4 to 8.1), suggesting the influence of anthropogenic nutrient sources throughout much of the bay. The N content of tissues (C. prolifera 3.0 to 4.9%; C. nodosa 1.8 to 3.0%) was highly associated with their isotopic composition, indicating that nutrient supply strongly influenced plant stoichiometry. Distance from the source, i.e. variation in water column nutrient concentration, which was also highly correlated with median current velocities (0.03 to 0.18 m s(-1)) and to a lesser extent benthic light dose (1.8 to 10.7 mol quanta m(-2) d(-1)), appeared to determine the mass transfer of N to the benthos. Significantly lower values of C. nodosa N content and delta N-15 hint at the role strong gradients in environmental conditions may play in promoting the stable coexistence of seagrasses and C. prolifera within the bay. C. prolifera was a useful indicator species that, via the analysis of its tissue composition, can provide a highly effective tool to aid in the management of nutrient inputs within shallow, coastal zones.

AB  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain isolated from milk in Poland and an environmental E. coli strain in wastewater from Garwolin and Lowicz dairies and in activated sludges from dairy sewage treatment plants as well as in dairy wastewater with activated sludges was examined. Environmental materials were contaminated with about 10(8) of target bacteria/ml of sample. The experiments were performed under temperature conditions typical of autumn-winter (6 degrees) and spring-summer (24 degrees C) seasons. It Was found that the non-pathogenic E. coli strain survived longer in all media than the enterohemorrhagic serotype. E. coli 0 1 57:H7 bacteria were not detected (in direct plating method) in activated sludges after 21-28 days; in dairy wastewater as well as in wastewater with activated sludges after 21-25 days. These periods for environmental E. coli strain were 35-42 days (activated sludges), 25-28 days (wastewater with activated sludges). At higher temperature environmental E. coli were not detected in wastewater from Lowicz dairy sewage treatment plant after 25 days, but the bacteria were still present in wastewater from Garwolin dairy sewage tratment plant after 34 days.
   The obtained results show that the lack of environmental E. coli bacteria (as a indicator bacteria of fecal contamination) in dairy wastewater and in dairy wastewater with activated sludges could indicate the absence of pathogenic E. coli bacteria. Prolonged existence of the enterohemorrhagic serotype in activated sludges shows the need to treat activated sludges prior to the utilization of these materials as fertilizer.

AB  - Assuming that animals respond optimally to environmental changes, both behavior and physiology should be useful indicators of the way that animals perceive the quality of their environment. For verification, we examined foraging time and gizzard size of the red knot (Calidris canutus), a long-distance migrant shorebird that ingests hard-shelled mollusk prey whole and therefore readily faces digestive constraints. Nevertheless, even when digestively bottlenecked, knots can still enhance their daily energy intake by flexibly increasing the size of their digestive system, notably the gizzard, and/or by feeding longer per day. Whether such adjustments are actually necessary depends on the quality (condition) of their food, i.e., the ratio of flesh to shell mass. Hence, gizzard mass and daily foraging time in knots may be reliable indicators of the quality of their invertebrate prey. This idea is explored by using field data on radio-marked knots during late summer in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Their gizzards were measured using ultrasonography and the knots' movements and working hours were monitored using handheld receivers and automated radio-tracking systems. Indeed, gizzard mass alone predicted annual variation in food quality satisfactorily; however, adding estimates for daily foraging time significantly improved the predictions. We discuss and conceptualize how knots may trade off digestive organ size against foraging time upon arrival in the Wadden Sea, given the quality and quantity of the food on offer, and why these findings are relevant in the context of conservation of migration systems.

AB  - Crustacean zooplankton form the keystone link between primary producers and fish stocks along the Norwegian shelf and in the southern part of the Barents Sea. We have established a multi-generation cultivation system for zooplankton in order to perform future experiments on the biological effects of drilling discharges from the offshore petroleum industry. A population of the cold-water species, Calanus finmarchicus, was collected in March 2004 and maintained in a static system of 100 1 polypropylene containers through all stages (Eggs-CVI). The population exhibited an average developmental time of 105 days which corresponds to realistic sub-Arctic to Arctic conditions (water temperatures= 5 degrees C (spring) and 8 degrees C (late summer)). A series of experiments was performed to examine copepod egg production as a function of different food sources and feeding concentrations. Only minor differences in egg production were observed for C. finmarchicus females fed with varying concentrations of the two diatom species Chaetoceros socialis and Thalassiosira weisflogii. In a separate experiment, the response to food availability was examined over time by tracking egg production and fecal pellet production (used as an indicator of food ingestion). Both hatching success and food ingestion were positively correlated with the food concentrations offered to adult females. Through this work we have demonstrated that C finmarchicus populations can be maintained in the laboratory through multiple generations. In addition, methods to control egg production through changes in food availability have been established making it feasible to control the start date of exposure experiments or the timing of the collection of eggs to initiate a new generation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive index system based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to evaluate the status quo of ecological security in the farming-pastoral zone of northern China, for the purpose of facilitating sustainable development in ecotone regions. Taking a typical transitional piedmont region with farming-pastoral production mode as a case study area, the region's present ecological security situation was evaluated by constructing an index system with 3 types of indicators. These indicators were: 1) vegetation growth, measured by the decadal difference in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); 2) change in landscape pat-terns, measured by the deviation of present from potential landscapes; and 3) severity of soil erosion, measured by organic matter content in topsoil. Data for the indicators, derived from RS images, historical maps, field surveys, and archival materials, were all mapped with the aid of a digital elevation model (DEM), according to their conjugation relationships. The results were obtained by classifying different combinations of elements in an index matrix of 3 indicators by means of mapping. The final results show that nearly the entire study area was in a condition ranging from somewhat insecure (SIN) to insecure (INS), with an average score of 3.46 in a 5-grade range, indicating declining ecological security. The situation was better in the farming-pastoral district. The whole region needs to adjust its production modes to learn from practices in the farming-pastoral district, in order to alleviate deterioration and improve ecological security in the region.

AB  - This paper and a companion article present illustrated guides to the identification of sub-fossil chironomid larvae (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) preserved in the sediments of low- and mid-elevation lakes in East Africa. They are based on analysis of surface-sediment death assemblages from 61 lakes located in the humid to semi-arid environments of equatorial East Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania), supplemented with similar surface-sediment samples from 12 lakes in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia), and sub-recent core samples from six lakes in Kenya and two in Uganda. We analyzed about 11,000 specimens and identified 98.4% of these to species, species group, genus, or tribe level depending on current alpha-taxonomic knowledge of the various genera considered and the taxonomic resolution of preserved diagnostic features. We distinguished 90 different sub-fossil morphotypes, of which 16 are Tanypodinae, 19 are Orthocladiinae, and 55 are Chironominae. Diagnostic characters distinguishing these morphotypes from each other resemble differences at the species level in the better-known Holarctic fauna, hence we consider most of our morphotypes equivalent to morphological species or groups of closely related species. In this paper we focus on the Tanypodinae and Orthocladiinae, with special attention to the high taxon richness among the Pentaneurini. Patterns of cephalic setation were found to facilitate identification of Tanypodinae both at the genus and species level, and contributed to improved taxonomic resolution in sub-fossil East African material. High taxon richness and numerical abundance of the Orthocladiinae in our study lakes indicates that a considerable number of African Orthocladiinae is adapted to warm standing-water environments.

AB  - Purpose of review Initial studies of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis focused on the role of rheumatoid factor and immune complex-associated vasculitis and synovitis. Subsequent work has delineated T cell responses, the role of cytokines, chemokines, and the aggressive nature of rheumatoid synovitis. Recent findings underscore the importance of humoral immunity in this entity and are the subject of this review.
   Recent findings By the discovery of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-RA33, and anti-GPI antibodies in the human and mouse systems, respectively, the impact of humoral autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis regained remarkable interest. This review summarizes recent insights into humoral autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis in the context of the generation of rheumatoid factors, including B cell activation via toll-like receptors and genetic predispositions that can trigger the induction of rheumatoid arthritis. The generation of rheumatoid factors that can also be found during host defense against infectious agents and under pathologic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, and hepatitis C-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia after hepatitis C infection is likely the result of genetic predispositions and the intensity of the (primary) immune reaction. Models of the role of rheumatoid factors in health and disease, including related lymphomagenesis, will be discussed.
   Summary In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the induction of rheumatoid factors can be taken as an indicator of severe disease with a striking involvement of B cell activation. Very recent clinical trials using B cell depletion support the concept that humoral immunity, as evidenced by the production of rheumatoid factors, plays a significant role in the course of the disease.

AB  - Different groups of green-lipped mussels (Perna viridis) were exposed to the same net amount of a genotoxicant mixture of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ([PAHs]: anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene) and four organochlorine pesticides ([OCs]; alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), aldrin, dieldrin, and p,p'-DDT) for four weeks under different regimes that simulated various scenarios of fluctuating toxicant levels in the marine environment. micronucleus (MN) formation in gill cells was studied at the end of each week. Micronucleus frequencies increased with continual addition of genotoxicants, and did not diminish significantly under conditions of either gradually decreasing concentrations or cessation of exposure for one to two weeks, suggesting that the MN response may persist over relatively long exposure periods. An almost two-fold higher mean MN frequency was recorded in a chronic exposure group than in an acute group that had received the same net nominal dose of genotoxicants, indicating that chronic exposure may lead to a greater genotoxic impact than acute exposure. The results suggested that in field studies, MN response should be monitored at multiple time points in order to elucidate the effects of potentially fluctuating toxicant levels. Finally, MN Formation was positively correlated with both nominal contaminant levels and tissue levels of the genotoxicants. These findings suggest that MN responses can be a sensitive indicator of exposure to relatively low levels of genotoxicants and that MN response in Mussel gill cells can he a stable biomarker of genotoxicity.

AB  - We analyzed 23 years of monitoring data from a bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) population to determine whether fecal nitrogen (FN), expected to reflect diet quality, can be used to track population nutritional status over the long term. We considered 3 measures of FN: its maximum value each spring (FN peak), the date of the peak, and the area under the curve relating julian date to summer FN (FN-total). We first determined the sources of variation in these 3 measures. Population density had a strong negative effect on FN-total while summer precipitation was positively related to FN-total, suggesting that diet quality declined with increasing density and improved with precipitation. Most sheep were recaptured every year, allowing us to assess FN as an indicator of nutritional condition by examining the relationships between summer mass gain and both FN peak and FN-total. The value of FN peak was not related to summer mass gain for any sex-age class, but FN-total was positively related to Summer mass gain of nonlactating females and yearling females. Our results suggest that FN can be used as an index of forage quality over several years. Over several years, FN also reflects aspects of bighorn sheep body growth and is correlated with changes in density that may ultimately affect population performance. Short-term monitoring of FN, however, may not provide much useful information.

AB  - Modification of soils with hydrophobic cationic surfactants is an effective approach for enhancing the sorptive capabilities of soil in the vadose zone for the purpose of retaining organic contaminants prior to cleanup. The objective of this study was to examine the sorptive behavior of the cationic surfactant-modified loess soil for aromatic anions in the aqueous phase in an attempt to define the sorptive mechanisms. Some dominant factors governing the sorption, such as ionic strength and divalent heavy metal cation, were investigated. The sorption isotherms of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and benzoic acid (BA) in the modified soil samples were obtained using the batch equilibration method. Under the laboratory conditions, the modified loess soil utilized in this study was prepared by replacing the cations of loess soil with a cationic surfactant-hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) bromide. The acidic aromatic compounds, DNP and BA existing as aromatic anions in the natural mixture of loess soil and aqueous phase, were selected as indicator compounds to measured the sorption behaviors of aromatic anions on the HDTMA-modified loess soil. The results confirmed that the sorptive capabilities of aromatic anions in loess soil were greatly enhanced by modification with HDTMA. The increase of ionic strength and the addition of divalent heavy metal cation Zn2+ significantly increased the sorption of aromatic anions on the HDTMA-modified loess soil. In binary solute systems, the sorbed amounts either of DNP or BA on the HDTMA-modified loess soil were reduced if two compounds existed simultaneously in the soil. This results indicated that competitive adsorption between the two aromatic anions occurred in soil matrix. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been proposed as a tool to measure levels of stress experienced by populations of organisms during development. To be of value as a biomarker to highlight conditions at particular sites, it is important that variation in FA is due to environmental (eg pollution) variation and not genetic variation among populations and families, in other words heritability for FA should be very close to zero. A full-sib design was set up in which families of Culex pipiens mosquitoes collected from the field were reared at three different developmental temperatures. The effects of temperature and family on developmental rate, egg to adult survival and four wing morphological measures were assessed. There was both a temperature and a family effect on development rate and survival. Temperature affected all four wing traits, but an influence of family was only evident in two of the wing traits. Two separate measures of FA for each of the wing traits were obtained. The mean estimates of FA were mainly around 1% of the value of the character measured. There was evidence of an increase in FA with increase in temperature stress. Heritability was estimated for the wing traits and wing trait FA's using restricted estimation maximum likelihood. The estimates of heritability for the wing traits were small and, individually, did not differ significantly from zero. There was also no evidence of heritable genetic variation for any of the wing trait FA's. The results are discussed in relation to other studies where FA heritabilities have been estimated and in relation to the use of FA as an indicator of environmental stress.

AB  - Urastoma cyprinae occurs on the gills of various bivalves species, including the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. While the worm is known to cause severe gill disruption in mussels, no evidence of this nature has been described for oysters. Nonetheless, high levels of U. cyprinae have been reported in oysters, which may, in turn, reduce the oyster's overall condition. U. cyprinae is strongly attracted to oyster gill mucus, which is suggested to play an active role in the worm's feeding activities. Furthermore, host mucus contains many active components, including proteases, which have been suggested to play a defensive role against invading organisms. It follows, therefore, that some of the interactions between U. cyprinae and oysters take place in host gill mucus. Studies were undertaken to determine whether the presence of U. cyprinae altered the electrophoretic profiles of oyster gill mucus, using proteases as indicators. Findings reveal that oyster gill mucus contains three proteases, a putative acid protease at 96 kDa, a zinc metalloprotease at 64 kDa, and a serine protease at 33 kDa. Results based on experiments using mucus preparations extracted from infected and noninfected oysters, along with those using lyophilized mucus incubated with live U. cyprinae, confirm that the presence of U. cyprinae alters the protease composition of gill mucus. The present data demonstrate that both U. cyprinae and host gill mucus actively secrete proteases. While the precise roles of these enzymes still need to be defined, one of their functions may be associated with digestion-related activities induced by the worm. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - The Dorsal de Cangucu Shear Zone (DCSZ) is part of a strike-slip fault system showing trends parallel to the Neoproterozoic Dom Feliciano Belt in southern Brazil. As an attempt to assess the role played by this fault system in the tectonic evolution of the continental crust in southern Brazil, a re-evaluation of the main structural, magmatic and geochronological characteristics of the best known shear zone of this system was conducted. Magmatism syntectonic to the strike-slip shear zone is represented by mantle-derived granodioritic magmas emplaced into transtensional segments. These were followed by crustal melts, represented by successively younger peraluminous granites. The porphyritic granodiorites have a mixed origin involving a parental dioritic magma that suffered fractional crystallisation and assimilation of crustal rocks. They present a well-developed subvertical magmatic fabric with northeast to north-south trending foliation and low plunging lineations defined by dimensional orientation of K-feldspar megacrysts. Partial melting of the country rocks is the most likely petrogenetic process for the origin of the peraluminous granites. Microstructures produced by solid-state deformation under lower amphibolite- to greenschist-facies metamorphic conditions exhibit ubiquitous kinematic indicators of sinistral displacement. The contribution of the transcurrent fault zones to crustal growth was limited to the emplacement of relatively small volumes of mantle-derived dioritic magma during their early stages of development. Large-scale tectonic control of the overall strain field responsible for the nucleation and sinistral displacement of these faults is likely to be a far-field effect of convergence between the Kalahari and Zaire Cratons during the final stages of Neoproterozoic amalgamation of West Gondwana.

AB  - Levels of 2 Schistosoma circulating antigens, the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) and the circulating cathodic antigen (CCA), were determined in serum samples collected, on a monthly basis over a period of 1.5 years, from 32 farm animals of different ages and from 12 tracer calves exposed to Schistosoma mattheei infection on a Zambian farm. Faecal egg counts were monitored in all animals and worm burdens in tracers determined after perfusion. Antigen determination tests in serum, with sensitivities between 95 and 100% in heifers and adult cows, proved to be excellent tools for the diagnosis of cattle schistosomiasis. Also in young calves, some infections could be demonstrated earlier by CCA determination than by faecal egg examination. A poor correlation was seen between the data for faecal egg counts and for CAA and CCA levels. It therefore appears that circulating antigen measurements in serum are of limited Value as indicators of the pathogenesis of infection in cattle. Although all tracer calves were found infected at perfusion, large variations were recorded in antigen levels. An unexpected finding was the observation in farm animals of a clear seasonal pattern in CAA levels, with significant increase between August and October during the second half of the dry season, when animals are subjected to heavy physical and nutritional stress. It therefore appears that, although circulating antigen determination may provide an indication of the worm burden in ageing infections, possible Variations of antigen clearance rate with the physiological condition of the host may complicate the interpretation of the results.

AB  - Methylglyoxal is present at low levels in most cells as a by-product of glycolysis and a product of lipid and amino acid catabolism, The most widely accepted method for measurement of methylglyoxal involves the derivatization of methylglyoxal with 1,2-diaminobenzene derivatives, such as o-phenylenediamine, followed by quantification of the resulting quinoxaline with highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Here we describe the modification of this procedure for the measurement of free intra- and extracellular methylglyoxal in animal cells grown in culture, Cell harvest and sample volume measurement techniques were developed, Solid-phase extraction prior to methylglyoxal derivatization reduced interferences unique to cell culture, such as the phenol red indicator dye used in most cell culture media, and extended the useful life of the HPLC column, In addition, this extraction step significantly lessened the interference represented by oxidative degradation of nucleic acids to methylglyoxal by perchloric acid under assay conditions, The concentration of free intracellular methylglyoxal in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells grown in culture ranged from 0.7 +/- 0.3 mu M (mean +/- 2 standard deviations; n = 4) to 1.2 +/- 0.3 mu M (mean +/- 2 standard deviations; n = 7), The concentration of free extracellular methylglyoxal in the growth medium was 0.07 +/- 0.02 mu M (mean +/- 2 standard deviations; n = 4), severalfold less than that found inside the cell, A possible explanation for the difference between measured free intracellular and extracellular methylglyoxal levels is that the assay for free intracellular methylglyoxal also measures some reversibly bound methylglyoxal.

AB  - The Boss Point Formation of Maritime Canada comprises alternating successions of braidplain sandstone, lacustrine mudstone, and lacustrine fluvio-deltaic sandstone and mudstone. These rocks were deposited within an active strike-slip basin during the early Pennsylvanian (Westphalian A), at a palaeolatitude of 8-degrees-S. Palaesols comprise a small but distinct proportion of the formation, and typically occur at the tops of fining upward sandstone-siltstone cycles.
   Spherulitic siderites from the Boss Point Formation occur within sandy and silty palaeosols. They occur as 'large' (> 200 mum) and 'small' (< 200 mum) diameter spherulitic nodules within calcrete, and show either a radially arranged ferroan calcite and siderite spar morphology, or contain a core of ferroan calcite, surrounded by a later formed sheath of siderite. Analytical data indicate that with respect to Ca-Mg-Mn, wide compositional variation occurs within the siderites. The Boss Point Formation siderites are similar to, but contain less Ca for a given Mg/Mn ratio, than previously published siderite compositional data. Published data, together with the results from the Boss Point Formation, indicate that a continuum exists in freshwater siderites, between the relatively Mn-depleted and the Mg-enriched analytical fields that were previously reported.
   The relatively low Ca values determined in the Boss Point Formation samples reflect the general lack of calcium in the sedimentary basin during sedimentation. Both chlorite and smectite clays may have been important sources of iron. It is concluded that the spherulitic siderites are eogenetic, and formed within small anoxic ponds rich in organic matter, under reducing and low dissolved sulphate conditions. With time these pools dried up, ferroan calcite precipitating as calcrete nodules around the earlier formed siderite spherulites.

AB  - Computer vision has shown potential for assisting post-earthquake inspection of buildings through automatic damage detection in images. However, assessing the safety of an earthquake-damaged building requires considering this damage in the context of its global impact on the structural system. Thus, an inspection must consider the expected damage progression of the associated component and the component's contribution to structural system performance. To address this issue, a digital twin framework is proposed for post-earthquake building evaluation that integrates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, component identification, and damage evaluation using a Building Information Model (BIM) as a reference platform. The BIM guides selection of optimal sets of images for each building component. Then, if damage is identified, each image pixel is assigned to a specific BIM component, using a GrabCut-based segmentation method. In addition, 3D point cloud change detection is employed to identify nonstructural damage and associate that damage with specific BIM components. Two example applications are presented. The first develops a digital twin for an existing reinforced concrete moment frame building and demonstrates BIM-guided image selection and component identification. The second uses a synthetic graphics environment to demonstrate 3D point cloud change detection for identifying damaged nonstructural masonry walls. In both examples, observed damage is tied to BIM components, enabling damage to be considered in the context of each component's known design and expected earthquake performance. The goal of this framework is to combine component-wise damage estimates with a pre-earthquake structural analysis of the building to predict a building's post-earthquake safety based on an external UAV survey.

AB  - Observational studies are an important tool for determining whether the findings from controlled experiments can be transferred into scenarios that are closer to subjects' real-life circumstances. A rigorous approach to observational studies involves collecting data from different sensors to comprehensively capture the situation of the subject. However, this leads to technical difficulties especially if the sensors are from different manufacturers, as multiple data collection tools have to run simultaneously. We present SensorHub, a system that can collect data from various wearable devices from different manufacturers, such as inertial measurement units, portable electrocardiographs, portable electroencephalographs, portable photoplethysmographs, and sensors for electrodermal activity. Additionally, our tool offers the possibility to include ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in studies. Hence, SensorHub enables multimodal sensor data collection under real-world conditions and allows direct user feedback to be collected through questionnaires, enabling studies at home. In a first study with 11 participants, we successfully used SensorHub to record multiple signals with different devices and collected additional information with the help of EMAs. In addition, we evaluated SensorHub's technical capabilities in several trials with up to 21 participants recording simultaneously using multiple sensors with sampling frequencies as high as 1000 Hz. We could show that although there is a theoretical limitation to the transmissible data rate, in practice this limitation is not an issue and data loss is rare. We conclude that with modern communication protocols and with the increasingly powerful smartphones and wearables, a system like our SensorHub establishes an interoperability framework to adequately combine consumer-grade sensing hardware which enables observational studies in real life.

AB  - Impacts of invasive species are often difficult to quantify, meaning that many invaders are prioritised for management without robust, contextual evidence of impact. Most impact studies for invasive plants compare heavily invaded with non-invaded sites, revealing little about abundance-impact relationships. We examined effects of increasing cover and volume of the non-native herbaceous groundcover Tradescantia fluminensis on a temperate rainforest community of southern Australia. We hypothesised that there would be critical thresholds in T. fluminensis abundance, below which the native plant community would not be significantly impacted, but above which the community's condition would degrade markedly. We modelled the abundance-impact relationship from 83 plots that varied in T. fluminensis abundance and landscape context and found the responses of almost all native plant indicators to invasion were non-linear. Native species richness, abundance and diversity exhibited negative exponential relationships with increasing T. fluminensis volume, but negative threshold relationships with increasing T. fluminensis cover. In the latter case, all metrics were relatively stable until cover reached between 20 and 30%, after which each decreased linearly, with a 50% decline occurring at 75-80% invader cover. Few growth forms (notably shrubs and climbers) exhibited such thresholds, with most exhibiting negative exponential relationships. Tradescantia fluminensis biomass increased dramatically at > 80% cover, with few native species able to persist at such high levels of invasion. Landscape context had almost no influence on native communities, or the abundance-impact relationships between T. fluminensis and the plant community metrics. Our results suggest that the diversity of native rainforest community can be maintained where T. fluminensis is present at moderate-to-low cover levels.

AB  - In 2015 an unprecedented effort was made in Paris by the countries adhering to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to decrease the CO2 emissions due to the close relationships of greenhouse gases with global warming. Under the previous Kyoto Protocol, only advanced countries were committed to reduce greenhouse emissions while under the Paris Climate Agreement all countries were committed to fight against global warming. The urgency of real action has been prompted by extreme events like bushfires, heatwaves, and the ongoing pandemic. Given the strong commitments, it looks interesting, seen that all countries are involved, to verify if any sustainability pattern is evident. Our approach is encouraging, as the downward emission trend shows a high increase in sustainability between 2027 and 2037. Without exacerbating the climate discussion, we used the national gross domestic product (hereafter: GDP) as environmental indicator to propose for the first time an allometric ranking of countries that need to change drastically their energy policy to meet their climate commitments. Any sustainability downturn in one country, especially if advanced, might rationally bring concern about the actual prospects of other countries which are all committed to the Paris Climate Agreement. But the departure from the annual allometric model GDP- CO2 may be much greater than can be accounted for by statistical expectations, as for Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan that are entering a sustainable condition where their CO2 emissions will be lower than they would have been without the Paris Climate Agreement.

AB  - In recent years, China's coal industry has faced a gradual decline in market demand, and companies have large inventories that are difficult to digest. At the same time, the global energy market is sluggish and market prices continue to fall, making the development of the domestic coal industry more difficult. In addition, limited by the current environment and resources, China's traditional and extensive supply-oriented coal enterprise development model is becoming less and less suitable for social development, and the traditional coal development model will also be transformed into a new development model. Regarding the current problems in China's coal industry, this article combines the use of environmental cost control research models and practical tests. After in-depth discussions with domestic and foreign research experts on environmental cost data, this paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the traditional environmental cost management of coal enterprises, and the operating conditions of listed companies, to find out the existing problems, and provide experience for the future environmental cost accounting of coal companies. At the same time, in this article, the cloud computing technology is directly introduced into the current construction and development of the coal industry, and it is proposed to rely on cloud computing services to provide help for the information reform of the coal industry. As we all know, the development of cloud computing needs to be based on computer networks to collect and analyze the data that needs to be processed. In this process, computer networks play a supporting role and provide practical assistance to the information construction of coal enterprises and support.

AB  - Internet of Things technologies are spurring new types of instructional games, namely reality-enhanced serious games (RESGs), that support training directly in the field. This paper investigates a key feature of RESGs, i.e., user performance evaluation using real data, and studies an application of RESGs for promoting fuel-efficient driving, using fuel consumption as an indicator of driver performance. In particular, we propose a reference model for supporting a novel smart sensing dataflow involving the combination of two modules, based on machine learning, to be employed in RESGs in parallel and in real-time. The first module concerns quantitative performance assessment, while the second one targets verbal recommendation. For the assessment module, we compared the performance of three well-established machine learning algorithms: support vector regression, random forest and artificial neural networks. The experiments show that random forest achieves a slightly better performance assessment correlation than the others but requires a higher inference time. The instant recommendation module, implemented using fuzzy logic, triggers advice when inefficient driving patterns are detected. The dataflow has been tested with data from the enviroCar public dataset, exploiting on board diagnostic II (OBD II) standard vehicular interface information. The data covers various driving environments and vehicle models, which makes the system robust for real-world conditions. The results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, attaining a high estimation correlation (R-2 = 0.99, with random forest) and punctual verbal feedback to the driver. An important word of caution concerns users' privacy, as the modules rely on sensitive personal data, and provide information that by no means should be misused.

AB  - Rapid and accurate identification of cardiac troponin I (cTnl) in biological fluids is very essential for judging acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein, we constructed an enzyme-free electrochemical immunosensing system for sensitive monitoring of human plasma cTnl cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Prussian blue-doped PAMAM dendrimer nanospheres (PBDENPs) were first synthesized by using in situ chemical reaction, and functionalized with polyclonal anti-human cTnl antibody as the signal-transduction tags. Field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized for characterization of the immunosensing platform. By using a monoclonal anti-human cTnl antibody-modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) as the immunsensing interface and polyclonal anti-cTnl antibody-labeled PBDENPs and the signal tags, a new sandwich-type immunoassay was designed for the determination of target cTnl by using square wave voltammetry (SWV). Multi-armed dendritic PAMAM nanospheres were expected to enhance the detectable signal of electrochemical immunoassay through the doped Prussian blue with electrochemical activity. Under optimum conditions, the enzyme-free electrochemical immunoassay displayed a wide linear range of four orders of magnitude from 0.01 ng mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 6.2 pg mL(-1) cTnl at the 3s(B) criterion. An intermediate precision of <= 10.9% was accomplished with batch-to-batch identification, and good anti-interference capacity against other cancer biomarkers or proteins was acquired toward target cTnl. In addition, measurements of human serum specimens were demonstrated to further confirm the method accuracy of electrochemical immunoassay, and well-matched results were obtained between the electrochemical immunoassay and the referenced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.

AB  - In recent years, emphasis has been placed on the design and implementation of sustainable energy system solutions to combat the adverse environmental impact of emissions from the power and transportation sectors. This study applies a systems elimination method using numerical simulation to validate and optimise recently-reported results demonstrating the benefits of photovoltaic (PV)-diesel - battery hybrid integrated power systems (IPS) for commercial centres, with Abuja in Nigeria used for the case study. An optimal IPS was identified from 20,200 candidate solutions analysed by assessment against environmental (1st priority) and economic (2nd priority) metrics. Although environmental conditions were prioritised, the optimal system was economically viable. The environmentally optimal system emitted 33% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 tonnes/yr.) than the economically optimised solution (PV-diesel) over their operational lifetimes ($/20 years), and was 4% costlier than same. The results demonstrate that carbon taxation or outright bans on independent fossil fuel systems (IFFSs) in emerging economies might not be effective policies in mitigating the impact of climate change on our environment. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on energising unserved and underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, considering the case study country of Nigeria. It decries the common practice of prioritising economic factors over environmental factors in optimising the operations of grid defected power system solutions as continental and regional electrification efforts are being ramped up. This is particularly of importance (an environmental responsibility), as immediate economic gains could have far-reaching environmental and social implications that elicits the limitations of economically prioritised power development projects in the offing.

AB  - An increasing anthropogenic impact on soils leads to qualitative and quantitative changes in chernozems, the richest soils on Earth. In this regard, the understanding of modern soil-forming processes is undoubtedly relevant because it will allow predicting the future state of not only soils, but also nature as a whole.
   The methodology for studying the evolution of chernozems is based on a process factor analysis of genetically conjugated and agrogenic series of chernozems of different taxonomic levels. The objects of the study were system complexes of soil series, including subtypes of virgin, arable, and irrigated chernozems in the central regions of Russia. The data obtained made it possible to identify patterns of variation in the composition and properties of virgin chernozems in a genetically conjugated series at a subtype level and in the series virgin land - arable land - irrigated arable land; we also detected the processes and factors that determine the nature and direction of changes in the composition and properties of chernozems in the studied series and determined the direction of anthropogenic evolution of chernozems.
   The main provisions of the work conceptually develop the theory of the chernozem forming process and serve as a theoretical basis for the development of models for the formation of the chernozem profile. Established quantitative and qualitative indicators of humus profiles of chernozems are important diagnostic features in the classification of these soils. The nature and direction of the chernozem evolution disclosed in the work can serve as the basis for long-term forecasting of the state of these soils and the development of a set of measures for their rational use and protection.

TI  - Degraded Image Enhancement Using Dual-Domain-Adaptive Wavelet and Improved Fuzzy Transform
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - A novel enhancement algorithm for degraded image using dual-domain-adaptive wavelet and improved fuzzy transform is proposed, aiming at the problem of surveillance videos degradation caused by the complex lighting conditions underground coal mine. Firstly, the dual-domain filtering (DDF) is used to decompose the image into base image and detail image, and the contrast limited adaptive histogram enhancement (CLAHE) is adopted to adjust the overall brightness and contrast of the base image. Then, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is utilized to obtain the low frequency sub-band (LFS) and high frequency sub-band (HFS). Next, the wavelet shrinkage threshold is applied to calculate the wavelet threshold corresponding to the HFS at different scales. Meanwhile, a new Garrate threshold function that introduces adjustment factor and enhancement coefficient is designed to adaptively de-noise and enhance the HFS coefficients, and the Gamma function is employed to correct the LFS coefficients. Finally, the PAL fuzzy enhancement operator is improved and used to perform contrast enhancement and highlight area suppression on the reconstructed image to obtain an enhanced image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can not only significantly improve the overall brightness and contrast of the degraded image but also suppresses the noise of dust and spray and enhances the image details. Compared with the similar algorithms of STFE, GTFE, CLAHE, SSR, MSR, DGR, and MSWT algorithms, the indicator values of comprehensive performance of the proposed algorithm are increased by 205%, 195%, 200%, 185%, 185%, 85%, 140%, and 215%, respectively. Moreover, compared with the other seven algorithms, the proposed algorithm has strong robustness and is more suitable for image enhancement in different mine environments.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate and compare the diversity of entomophagous insects in untreated and treated pecan orchards with biorational and conventional insecticides in the Comarca Lagunera region of Coahuila and Durango, Mexico. Insects were collected monthly with a sweep net from April to September in 2016 and 2017 in a nontreated orchard (control), two treated with biorational insecticides, and one treated with conventional insecticides. The nonparametric estimators Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, and Michaelis-Menten were used to estimate alpha diversity by species accumulation curves. The greatest species richness was in the untreated orchard with 37 species and abundance of 315 insects. Species richness in the two orchards treated with biorational insecticides was 28 to 29 species, and abundance 192 to 315 insects, while in the orchard treated with conventional insecticides richness was 22 species and abundance of 108 entomophagous insects. Orchards with biorational insecticides showed more species shared (beta diversity) compared with the control orchard (46%), than the orchard with conventional insecticides (37%). The gamma diversity (regional species richness) was of 48 species. The most abundant parasitoids were Telenomus sp. 1, and Quadrastichus sp., and the predators Chrysoperla comanche, Lispe sp. 1 and Olla v-nigrum. These results indicate that biorational management of pest insects using low environmental impact and high selectivity insecticides in combination with Trichogramma releases, can promote greater diversity and conservation of beneficial insects in the pecan agroecosystem. Considering the small number of orchards in this study, additional research on the diversity of beneficial insects, considering differences in environmental conditions, incidence of pest insects and agronomic management of pecan, are necessary.

AB  - Inorganic compounds in groundwater may derive from both natural processes and anthropogenic activities. The assessment of natural background levels (NBLs) is often useful to distinguish these sources. The approaches for the NBLs assessment can be classified as geochemical (e.g., the well-known pre-selection method) or statistical, the latter involving the application of statistical procedures to separate natural and anthropogenic populations. National Guidelines for the NBLs assessment in groundwater have been published in Italy (ISPRA 155/2017), based mainly on the pre-selection method. The Guidelines propose different assessment paths according to the sample size in spatial/temporal dimension and the type of the distribution of the pre-selected dataset, taking also into account the redox conditions of the groundwater body. The obtained NBLs are labelled with a different confidence level in function of number of total observations/monitoring sites, extension of groundwater body and aquifer type (confined or unconfined). To support the implementation of the Guidelines, the on-line tool evaluation of natural background levels (eNaBLe), written in PHP and using MySQL as DBMS (DataBase Management System), has been developed. The main goal of this paper is to describe the functioning of eNaBLe and test the tool on a case study in central Italy. We calculated the NBLs of As, F, Fe and Mn in the southern portion of the Mounts Vulsini groundwater body, within the volcanic province of Latium (Central Italy), also separating the reducing and oxidizing facies. Specific results aside, this study allowed to verify the functioning and possible improvements of the online tool and to identify some criticalities in the procedure NBLs assessment at the groundwater body scale

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is considered an important indicator of soil quality, which can be impacted by crop production practices such as tillage. In this study, two long-term tillage regimes (conventional tillage [CT] and no tillage [NT], conducted for 36 years) were compared in continuous sorghum production in a sub-tropical environment in southeast Texas. The positive effects of long-term NT practice were more conspicuous at the soil surface compared with the deeper soil profiles. The SOC was greater (1.5 t C ha(-1)greater) in the NT system compared with the CT system. Results from an incubation study indicate that the rate of C-min at 0-5 cm soil depth was significantly greater (164 mu g of CO2-C g(-1)of soil greater) in NT than that of CT, but this trend was reversed at 10-20 cm depth wherein the C-min rates were 106 mu g of CO2-C g(-1)of soil greater in CT compared with NT, which is likely because of soil disturbance during the study. Soil cumulative CO2-C emissions were greater in the CT system (7.28 g m(-2)) than in the NT system (5.19 g m(-2)), which is primarily attributed to high soil temperature conditions in the CT system. Sorghum grain yield however was not influenced by the differences in SOC content in this long-term experiment. Overall, the present study found that long-term conservation tillage improved SOC stock and reduced carbon loss, thus had a positive impact on soil health and sustainability.

AB  - The paper proposes a procedure based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) in order to identify the optimal dimension for inter-municipal cooperation in waste management. Given: (a) a set of decision making units (DMUs) and a production process that virtually transforms municipal expenditure in different amounts of sorted and unsorted waste, (b) a set of exogenous variables conditioning the operational environment of the DMUs and (c) a variable used for measuring the dimension of inter-municipal cooperation, the procedure realizes an iterative correction of input values and efficiency scores to purge, first, the effects of the exogenous variables, and then those of the dimensional variable. In this way, an indicator of the impact of the dimensional variable on the efficiency is obtained for each of the observed DMUs. An application on waste collection services is proposed using data relative to a set of Italian DMUs with a population ranging between 20,000 and 300,000. The results show that DMUs not exceeding the total population of around 55,000 (upper bound of the eighth population decile) provide the best solution for inter-municipal cooperation. Over that level, increases of the population consistently worsen average efficiency (the mean of the impact of the dimensional variable on efficiency scores more than doubles from the eighth to the ninth decile and more than quintuples from the eighth to the last decile). The procedure can be applied to different regional and national contexts and even to inter-municipal cooperation concerning other public services. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deficit irrigation is a valid alternative to conventional irrigation to save water while maintaining high productivity in tomatoes. However, crop sensitivity to water stress due to deficit irrigation may change with the growth stage. To assess the physiological and agronomic responses of processing tomatoes to deficit irrigation applied at critical stages, a field experiment was conducted in a coastal site of Southern Italy, where seven irrigation treatments differing for daily evapotranspiration (ETc) restored (100%-full or 50%-deficit) and the time of watering (long-season or limited to the vegetative period or to flowering) were applied to processing tomatoes cv. Hypeel F1. Plants continuously irrigated and those irrigated only at flowering maintained higher rates of leaf transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) over those irrigated only during the vegetative period. Fruit yield was the greatest under long-season full irrigation (51 t ha(-1)). Severe soil water deficit during flowering, more than during the vegetative period, adversely affected crop productivity. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was maximized under long-season deficit irrigation (>19 kg m(-3)) or deficit irrigation during flowering (>16 kg m(-3)).Eandg(s)measured at early or mid-flowering may be adopted as valuable indicators to predict crop productivity; however, they may be altered under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Predawn water potential, being little affected by VPD, is a more reliable parameter than leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance under these climatic conditions.

AB  - We present new quantitative calcareous nannofossil data from a Barremian (Early Cretaceous) black shale interval of the Boreal Realm. Thirty samples from two sections in northern Germany have been investigated. The current study aims to understand the genesis of the Barremian black shales, so far only described from the Boreal Realm, in a supraregional to global context by assessing the diversity patterns, relative abundances and biometry of calcareous nannofossils from a distinctive late early Barremian black shale horizon. For morphometric size measurements, three common taxa, Biscutum constans, Rhagodiscus asper and Watznaueria barnesiae have been investigated.
   The results show a decrease in size and abundance of the high fertility indicator B. constans for the main black shale horizon (Hauptblatterton), while abundances of the warm water species R. asper and Watznaueria spp. increase. Deep dwelling nannoconids only flourished during black shale deposition. This indicates warm, oligotrophic surface waters and an expanded photic zone during the formation of the Hauptblatterton black shales. Similar observations have been made for the Oceanic Anoxic Event 1d (OAE 1d, Albian) in the Vocontian Basin (Southern France) and for the OAE 2 (Cenomanian) in the Western Interior Seaway and southern England. For W. barnesiae our data confirm a high ecological tolerance and we assume a response in size if a certain limit is exceeded towards more extreme conditions. Nutrients therefore likely play a larger role than water temperature. From our results, it seems likely that nutrient availability controls both, size and abundance patterns of B. constans.

AB  - CLIMEX and MED-FOES models integrate climate and data on Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), biology and use it to define the environmental suitability for the pest at specific geographical locations. CLIMEX calculates growth indices as indicators of conditions that are suitable for medfly population growth. MED-FOES incorporates additional information on pest management interventions to simulate the process and timing of medfly eradication. CLIMEX simulations of climatic suitability in California and Florida indicated that the most favorable periods for medfly population growth are March through May and October through November, whereas the environment would be especially stressful during the summer months, except when irrigation is applied. With irrigation, California is highly suitable for medfly population growth during the summer months. Due to cool temperatures, medfly populations are likely to decline significantly in January through February in Los Angeles,Tampa, and Miami, and probably not survive in San Francisco. According to MED-FOES simulations, it possibly would take longer to eradicate medfly from California than Florida, particularly if the incursions are initiated in the summer months. Medfly annual growth indices for the ENSO La Nina years are relatively low for San Francisco and Los Angeles but above neutral for Tampa and very high for Miami. During the El Nino phase, the growth index remains unchanged for San Francisco, increases for Los Angeles, and decreases for Tampa and Miami. CLIMEX and MED-FOES models are useful for informing plans to manage invasion threats from medfly and other invasive insects.

AB  - Due to the increasing sewage sludge production in the world and problems with its disposal, an application of sludge to the soil appears to be a suitable solution considering its fertilizer properties and ability to improve the soil physical conditions. On the other hand, the sludge may also contain undesirable and toxic substances. Since soil microorganisms are sensitive to environmental changes, they can be used as indicators of soil quality. In this study, we used sewage sludge (SS) from two municipal wastewater treatment plants (SS-A and SS-B) in the dose of 5 t/ha and 15 t/ha in order to determine possible changes in the fungal community diversity, especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), in the rhizosphere of Arundo donax L. Rhizosphere samples were collected in summer and autumn for two consecutive years and the fungal diversity was examined using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and 18S rDNA sequencing. Fungal alpha diversity was more affected by SS-A than SS-B probably due to the higher heavy metal content. However, based on principal component analysis and ANOSIM, significant changes in overall fungal diversity were not observed. Simultaneously, 18S rDNA sequencing showed that more various fungal taxa were detected in the sample with sewage sludge than in the control. Glomus sp. as a representative of AMF was the most represented. Moreover, Funneliformis in both samples and Rhizophagus in control with Septoglomus in the sludge sample were other representatives of AMF. Our results indicate that the short-term sewage sludge application into the soil does not cause a shift in the fungal community composition.

AB  - Intraspecific variability in morphological and ecophysiological leaf traits might be theorized to be present in declining populations, since they seem to be exposed to stress and plasticity could be advantageous. Here we focused on declining Persian oaks (Quercus brantii Lindl. var. persica (Jaub and Spach) Zohary) in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran, representing the most important tree species of this region. We selected trees with contrasting crown dieback, from healthy to severely defoliated, to investigate the relationships between canopy dieback and leaf morphology, water content and pigments. We also measured esterase and peroxidase, as enzymatic antioxidants and indicators of contrasting genotypes. Trees showing moderate to severe defoliation showed higher leaf mass area (LMA), reduced relative water content (RWC), and lower stomatal density (SD). Increasing LMA indicates a more sclerophyllic structure, according to drier conditions. We did not find significant differences in leaf pigments (chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids) among crown dieback classes, suggesting that Persian oak trees are able to maintain accurate photochemical efficiency, while reduced RWC and SD suggest hydraulic limitations. Our results do not provide a consistent pattern as regards enzymatic antioxidant defense in Persian oak. Morphological leaf traits would be important drivers of future adaptive evolution in Persian oak, leading to smaller and thicker leaves, which have fitness benefits in dry environments. Nonetheless, drought responses may be critically affecting carbon uptake, as photosynthetic compounds are less effectively used in leaves with higher sclerophylly.

AB  - Microalgae can be harmful to natural water in a variety of ways, and how to deal with this problem has received much attention. Magnetic nitrogen-doped microalgae-derived carbon (Fe-N@MC) was successfully prepared by pyrolysis under different temperatures. The sp(2)-hybridized carbon and C=O bond structure were strongly dependent on the pyrolysis temperature, and Fe-N@MC500 had a higher ratio of sp(2) -hybridized carbon than other counterparts. The surface morphology and structure analysis indicated that the Fe3O4 was successfully anchored into the carbon layer for magnetic separation. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was selected as the indicator to test the catalytic performance. In the presence of peroxymonosulfate (PMS), the degradation efficiencies of nano-Fe3O4, N@MC500 and Fe-N@MC500 for CIP were 46.8%, 79.8% and 92.6% within 120 min. Under different reaction conditions (PMS dosage, pH, temperature), Fe-N@MC500 composite was shown to have superior efficiency and stability. Radical quenching experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) indicated that singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was dominant in the reaction supplemented by( center dot)OH and SO4 center dot-. It is believed that PMS could work as both acceptor and donor for efficient activation by sp(2)-hybird carbon structure and C=O bond. This study successfully provides a feasible method for the synthesis of recycled Fe-N@MC with microalgae as a renewable carbon feedstock to deal with antibiotics.

AB  - Anthropogenic and climatic factors are important determinants of algal distribution in aquatic systems. This study aimed to identify temporary pond-groups of phytoplankton assemblages and to establish the interactions between environmental variables and phytoplankton structure. Phytoplankton samples were collected and preserved with 5% formalin; water samples for chemical analysis were taken in August and September 2007, 2008, and 2009 in 86 ponds randomly selected in the Sahelian sector and the Sudanian sector (protected and unprotected areas) of Burkina Faso. Plankton species were examined using light microscopy and identified using standard methods. A Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber was used for algal cell counting. NMDS ordination, indicator species analysis and canonical analysis were performed using Pc-Ord and CANOCO. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests using the software Statistica were performed to compare parameters between pond-groups. Three pond-groups were identified: the Sahelian pond-group, dominated by Lyngbya martensiana and Pseudanabaena constricta; the protected area pond-group, dominated by Euglena caudata and Trachelomonas raciborskii; and the unprotected area pond-group, dominated by Closterium venus and Euglena proxima. At P < 0.05, species composition and abundance in algal groups were mostly associated with nitrate, pH, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity. The Sahelian and the Sudanian sectors were different in pH, water transparency, and species richness. Univariate and multivariate analyses illustrate that variations in the physicochemical properties of water and algal structure followed climatic and anthropogenic gradients. The classification of ponds into algal associations demonstrated that algal assemblages may be used as reliable indicators of habitat conditions.

AB  - Habitat-forming species increase spatial complexity and alter local environmental conditions, often facilitating the assembly of plants and animals. We conducted a trait-based approach to algal assemblages associated with the fresh-water bryozoan, Pectinatella magnifica. Association with algae leads to the inner bodies of the bryozoans being colored green; this is frequently observed in the large rivers of South Korea. We collected the green-colored gelatinous matrices and phytoplankton from waterbodies of the two main rivers in South Korea. Algal assemblages within the colonies and in the waterbodies were compared using the three diversity indices (richness, diversity, and dominance), and the composition of functional groups (FGs) and morphologically based functional groups (MBFGs) between the colonies within and outside of P. magnifica colonies. The most dominant and common species within the colonies were Oscillatoria kawamurae and Pseudanabaena catenata, both of which were assigned to the same FG (codon SI ). Of the algal assemblages within the colonies, the dominance was higher, while the richness and diversity were lower, than those in the waterbodies. There was variation in the compositions of FGs and MBFGs in the waterbodies outside the colonies. Total nitrogen and orthophosphate led to dominance, and were significant factors for the variation in FGs in the waterbodies, whereas there were no such significant factors within the colonies. This trait-based approach to the community structure of associated algae provides the status and habitat gradient of these communities, which are stable, isolated, and consistent with the overgrowth of shade-adapted tychoplanktonic cyanobacteria.

AB  - In this study we analyzed sediment trap time series from five tropical sites to assess seasonal variations in concentrations and fluxes of long-chain diols (LCDs) and associated proxies with emphasis on the long-chain diol index (LDI) temperature proxy. For the tropical Atlantic, we observe that generally less than 2% of LCDs settling from the water column are preserved in the sediment. The Atlantic and Mozambique Channel traps reveal minimal seasonal variations in the LDI, similar to the two other lipid-based temperature proxies TEX86 and U-37(K'). In addition, annual mean LDI-derived temperatures are in good agreement with the annual mean satellite-derived sea surface temperatures (SSTs). In contrast, the LDI in the Cariaco Basin shows larger seasonal variation, as do the TEX86 and U-37(K'). Here, the LDI underestimates SST during the warmest months, which is possibly due to summer stratification and the habitat depth of the diol producers deepening to around 20-30 m. Surface sediment LDI temperatures in the Atlantic and Mozambique Channel compare well with the average LDI-derived temperatures from the overlying sediment traps, as well as with decadal annual mean SST. Lastly, we observed large seasonal variations in the diol index, as an indicator of upwelling conditions, at three sites: in the eastern Atlantic, potentially linked to Guinea Dome upwelling; in the Cariaco Basin, likely caused by seasonal upwelling; and in the Mozambique Channel, where diol index variations may be driven by upwelling from favorable winds and/or eddy migration.

AB  - Our article is devoted to development and verification of the metaheuristic optimisation algorithm in the course of selection of the compositional proportions of the slag-filled concretes. The experimental selection of various compositions and working modes, which ensure one and the same fixed level of a basic property, is the very labour-intensive and time-consuming process. This process cannot be feasible in practice in many situations, for example, in the cases, where it is necessary to investigate composite materials with equal indicators of resistance to aggressive environments or with equal share of voids in the certain range of dimensions. There are many similar articles in the scientific literature. Therefore, it is possible to make the conclusion on the topicality of the above-described problem. In our article, we will consider development of the methodology of the automated experimental-and-statistical determination of optimal compositions of the slag-filled concretes. In order to optimise search of local extremums of the complicated functions of the multi-factor analysis, we will utilise the metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, which is based on the concept of the swarm intelligence. Motivation in respect of utilisation of the swarm intelligence algorithm is conditioned by the absence of the educational pattern, within which it is not necessary to establish a certain pattern of learning as it is necessary to do in the neural-network algorithms. In the course of performance of this investigation, we propose this algorithm, as well as procedure of its verification on the basis of the immediate experimental verification.

AB  - Microbial fate and transport in watersheds should include a microbial source apportionment analysis that estimates the importance of each source, relative to each other and in combination, by capturing their impacts spatially and temporally under various scenarios. A loosely configured software infrastructure was used in microbial source-to-receptor modeling by focusing on animal-and human-impacted mixed-use watersheds. Components include data collection software, a microbial source module that determines loading rates from different sources, a watershed model, an inverse model for calibrating flows and microbial densities, tabular and graphical viewers, software to convert output to different formats, and a model for calculating risk from pathogen exposure. The system automates, as much as possible, the manual process of accessing and retrieving data and completes input data files of the models. The workflow considers land-applied manure from domestic animals on undeveloped areas; direct shedding (excretion) on undeveloped lands by domestic animals and wildlife; pastureland, cropland, forest, and urban or engineered areas; sources that directly release to streams from leaking septic systems; and shedding by domestic animals directly to streams. The infrastructure also considers point sources from regulated discharges. An application is presented on a real-world watershed and helps answer questions such as: What are the major microbial sources? What practices contribute to contamination at the receptor location? What land-use types influence contamination at the receptor location? and Under what conditions do these sources manifest themselves? This research aims to improve our understanding of processes related to pathogen and indicator dynamics in mixed-use watershed systems.

AB  - Cuban coral reefs have been called the "crown jewels of the Caribbean Sea," but there are few comparative data to validate this claim. Here, we provide an overview of Cuban coral reefs based on surveys carried out between 2010 and 2016 on seven of the main Cuban coral reef systems: Havana, Artemisa, Los Colorados, Punta Frances, Los Canarreos Archipelago, Peninsula Ancon, and Jardines de la Reina. Ecological indicators were evaluated for each of these areas at the community level. Results suggest differences among benthic communities (corals, sponges, and gorgonians) that are most evident for reefs that develop near highly urbanized areas, such as Havana, than for those far from the coast and less accessible. Offshore reefs along the south-central coast at Jardines de la Reina and Peninsula Ancon exhibited high coral density and diversity. Acropora cervicornis (Lamarck, 1816) and the Orbicella complex corals were uncommon, possibly indicating losses prior to our study due to coral diseases or competition with macroalgae. Siderastrea siderea (Ellis and Solander, 1786) was the most consistently-abundant species at all reef sites. The ecological condition at Jardines de la Reina and Peninsula Ancon is comparatively healthy. Our study supports claims that some Cuban coral reef systems are probably among the best preserved in the Caribbean basin, but other highly impacted areas exhibit many of the degradation patterns that are common to the rest of the Caribbean region. Strong conservation strategies are required with regard to subsistence fisheries and pollution at highly-impacted reefs to stop further degradation, and reefs that appear healthy need protection to avoid degradation and maintain resilience.

AB  - In the present study, we tested whether there were proteomic differences in blood between schizophrenia patients after the initial onset of the disorder and controls; and whether those differences were also present at birth among neonates who later developed schizophrenia compared to those without a psychiatric admission. We used multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry to quantify 77 proteins (147 peptides) in serum samples from 60 first-onset drug-naive schizophrenia patients and 77 controls, and 96 proteins (152 peptides) in 892 newborn blood-spot (NBS) samples collected between 1975 and 1985. Both serum and NBS studies showed significant alterations in protein levels. Serum results revealed that Haptoglobin and Plasma protease C1 inhibitor were significantly upregulated in first-onset schizophrenia patients (corrected P < 0.05). Alpha-2-antiplasmin, Complement C4-A and Antithrombin-III were increased in first-onset schizophrenia patients (uncorrected P-values 0.041, 0.036 and 0.013, respectively) and also increased in newborn babies who later develop schizophrenia (P-values 0.0058, 0.013 and 0.044, respectively). We also tested whether protein abundance at birth was associated with exposure to an urban environment during pregnancy and found highly significant proteomic differences at birth between urban and rural environments. The prediction model for urbanicity had excellent predictive performance in both discovery (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.90) and validation (AUC = 0.89) sample sets. We hope that future biomarker studies based on stored NBS samples will identify prognostic disease indicators and targets for preventive measures for neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly those with onset during early childhood, such as autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Modelling the hydrodynamics and fine-sediment dynamics in estuarine environments is important for coastal engineering design and environmental assessment. This paper presents the application of a coupled wave-current-sediment transport model to a complex estuarine system with high spatial resolution in a harbour area. The case study was the Rio de Ia Plata, with a focus on the Montevideo Bay area. We used a bidimensional depth-averaged approach, and the sediment transport modelling focused on fine cohesive sediments. The model considers realistic forcings, allows for the simulation of complex geometries such as those present in harbour basins and is capable of providing long-term environmental simulations (on the order of several years) within reasonable computational times. The model results are in good agreement with the measured data and satisfactorily represent the main features of the flow and sediment dynamics of the Rio de la Plata. The effect of the internal coupling on the hydrodynamic results is analysed, and the computational times with various coupling alternatives are discussed.
   The dynamics of fine sediment in Montevideo Bay were analysed based on the model results. The current-induced bottom shear stress results are relevant for representing the permanent suspended sediment concentrations, whereas the wave-induced bottom shear stress is fundamental for reproducing the main resuspension events during storm conditions. The suspended fine-sediment dynamics in the estuary are strongly controlled by the sediment exchange between the bed and water column, whereas inside Montevideo Bay, the dynamics are controlled mainly by advection of sediment originating from the nearby coastal area.

AB  - Geodetic observations of surface deformation associated with volcanic activities can be used to constrain volcanic source parameters and their kinematics. Simple analytical models, such as point and spherical sources, are widely used to model deformation data. The inherent nature of oversimplified model geometries makes them unable to explain fine details of surface deformation. Current nonparametric, geometry-free inversion approaches resolve the distributed volume change, assuming it varies smoothly in space, which may detect artificial volume change outside magmatic source regions. To obtain a physically meaningful representation of an irregular volcanic source, we devise a new sparsity-promoting modeling scheme assuming active magma bodies are well-localized melt accumulations, namely, outliers in the background crust. First, surface deformation data are inverted using a hybrid L-1- and L-2-norm regularization scheme to solve for sparse volume change distributions. Next, a boundary element method is implemented to solve for the displacement discontinuity distribution of the reservoir, which satisfies a uniform pressure boundary condition. The inversion approach is thoroughly validated using benchmark and synthetic tests, of which the results show that source dimension, depth, and shape can be recovered appropriately. We apply this modeling scheme to deformation observed at Kilauea summit for periods of uplift and subsidence leading to and following the 2007 Father's Day event. We find that the magmatic source geometries for these periods are statistically distinct, which may be an indicator that magma is released from isolated compartments due to large differential pressure leading to the rift intrusion.

AB  - Identification for the modal parameters of an instrumented office building using ambient vibration measurements is conducted in this study based on a recently developed stochastic subspace identification methodology equipped with an alternative stabilization diagram and a hierarchical sifting process. The identified results are then deliberately examined to recognize the dynamic features for quite a few dominant modes of this building structure including three pairs of closely-spaced modes. Making use of the collected three-month data including three seismic events, the analyzed results show that the root-mean-square vibration response is directly related to the wind speed and indirectly related to the air temperature under a specific condition. More importantly, it is discovered that the root-mean-square response is the dominant factor to induce the variation of modal parameters. Except for the torsional modes, all the other modal frequencies are highly correlated with the root-mean-square acceleration in a negative manner and the corresponding damping ratios also clearly display a positive correlation. Another crucial observation from this assessment is that the percentages of frequency variation in three months for most of the identified modes go beyond 10%. The effects of three nondestructive earthquakes are further traced to observe the tendencies of reducing the modal frequencies and raising the damping ratios, both with a variation level possibly increasing with the seismic intensity. But different from the effects of environmental factors, the changes in modal parameters caused by nondestructive earthquakes will vanish right after the seismic events.

AB  - Characterizing the baseline and stress-induced hormonal, metabolite, and immune profiles of wild animals is important to assess the impacts of variable environments, including human-induced landscape changes, on organismal health. Additionally, the extent to which these profiles are coordinated across physiological systems within individuals remains an important question in understanding how stressors can differentially affect aspects of an individual's physiology. Here, we present data from wild populations of the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) on both baseline and stress-induced biomarkers: plasma corticosterone (CURT) concentration, plasma glucose concentration, and whole blood heterophil:Iymphocyte ratio. Using a standardized restraint protocol with individuals from populations in disparate portions of this species' range the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and the plains of Iowa we collected blood plasma samples at nine time points over three days. Both CURT and glucose response curves differed between georegions, with Iowa snakes attaining higher glucose concentration and maintaining elevated CURT and glucose levels for a longer duration. Additionally, both the total amount and proportional increases of CURT and glucose were lower in larger and therefore older snakes, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in stress perception or response. Within-individual correlation among the three physiological indicators was significant at the time of capture, absent after 3 h in captivity, and partially restored after 3 days in captivity, demonstrating the effect of stress on the relationships among these physiological systems.

AB  - Time-stability of the soil water content (SWC) under influence of a native forest has great interest, however, it has been little scientifically explored in tropical and subtropical regions. This study aimed to monitor in a systematic way the SWC at soil depth to analyze its space-time variability and time-stability under conditions of an Atlantic Forest remnant, a native environment of southeastern Brazil. Time-stability was monitored at five soil depths (0.10 m, 0.20 m, 0.30 m, 0.40 m and 1.0 m), analyzing the statistical dispersion measures (SDM). Based on SDM, we also aimed to infer about the time-stability locations that are most representative for the study site. The sampling effort for SWC comprised a monthly recording time step at 32 points in the site from June/2013 to January/2016. We observed a decrease in the variability of the following SDM with increase of soil depth: mean relative difference (delta(ij)), standard deviation and Temporal Stability Indicator (TSI). It was possible to infer that local topographic elements induced the time-stability. It was not possible to select only one location representative for SWC since the statistical criteria did not adequately converge for all soil depths at the same location. However, the point locations selected for each depth produced adequate statistics of validation. We were able to identify the relation between the points and the landscape representation indicators, which can help in the endeavor of identification of point locations which are more stable and the time-stability of SWC in a native forest site.

AB  - Aim. The aim of the research is to study the cytogenetic disorders in the cells of apical meristem of the sprouts of urban green plantations of the small-leaved linden (Tilia cordata L.) and rattlertree (Populus alba L.) growing under different conditions in terms of anthropogenic impact as parks, squares and places of street plantings along urban highways. Methods. Cytogenetic abnormalities in the cells of the apical meristem of small-leaved linden and rattlertree have been studied in terms of the frequency of occurrence of micronuclei and protrusions of nuclei of different forms. The buds for analysis were collected from a tree of 1.5-2 m. height in spring during March-April 2009, 2012 and 2015. The collected buds were processed with acetalcohol, micropreparations of cells of the apical meristem were made and stained with acetocarmine. Karyological indicators were analyzed and cited by L.P. Sychova. Findings. The study reveals that the most pronounced cytogenetic disturbances in terms of the frequency of occurrence of micronuclei and protrusions of nuclei of different forms were significantly higher in the cells of the apical meristem of the sprouts of small-leaved linden and rattlertree plantations along the city's highways compared to the same parameters of the parks and squares studied. Cells of the apical meristem of the sprouts of small-leaved linden are most sensitive to technogenically polluted environment in comparison with the cells of rattlertree sprouts. Conclusion. Cells of the apical meristem of the sprouts of the investigated trees, especially of small-leaved linden, can serve as indicators of the genotoxicity of the city's environment.

AB  - The osmotin protein is involved in both monocot and dicot plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. To determine the biological activity of osmotin, the gene was amplified from tobacco genomic DNA, fused with the hexahistidine tag motif and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, after which the recombinant osmotin was purified and renatured. Various activities were then tested, including hemolytic activity, toxicity against human embryonic kidney cells, and the antifungal activity of the recombinant osmotin. We found that osmotin had no adverse effects on human kidney cells up to a concentration of 500 mu g.ml(-1). However, the purified osmotin also had significant antimicrobial activity, specifically against fungal pathogens causing candidiasis and otitis, and against the common food pathogens.
   Using the osmotin-Agrobacterium construct, the osmotin gene was inserted into tobacco plants in order to facilitate the isolation of recombinant protein. Using qPCR, the presence and copy number of the transgene was detected in the tobacco plant DNA. The transgene was also quantified using mRNA, and results indicated a strong expression profile, however the native protein has been never isolated. Once the transgene presence was confirmed, the transgenic tobacco plants were grown in high saline concentrations and monitored for seed germination and chlorophyll content as indicators of overall plant health. Results indicated that the transgenic tobacco plants had a higher tolerance for osmotic stress. These results indicate that the osmotin gene has the potential to increase crop tolerance to stresses such as fungal attack and unfavorable osmotic conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Efflux of dissolved solutes in agricultural subsurface drainage systems adversely affects the ecosystems of receiving waters, degrades soil fertility, and represents an economic loss to farmers. These solutes are frequently studied without regard to their associated ions, which play a fundamental role in their transport characteristics. In this study, we conducted a literature review to identify major dissolved constituents in agricultural drainage waters characteristic of central Iowa and pinpointed causes of variability in the leaching rate of these constituents. This literature review is complemented by a thorough field investigation that analyzes major solute concentrations with respect to seasonal conditions, common cropping systems, and relationships among ions. Results from this investigation reveal that primary dissolved constituents consist of bicarbonate, calcium, nitrate, magnesium, chloride, sodium, and sulfate (in order of decreasing ppm concentration). Analysis of seasonal drainage samples showed that bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium were present at greater concentrations during the post-growing season, while nitrate and chloride concentrations were greatest during the growing season. Seasonal variability of sulfate and sodium was negligible. Continuous corn and corn in annual rotation with soybeans had greater magnesium and chloride concentrations than soybeans in annual rotation with corn. Conversely, calcium concentrations were greater for soybean cropping systems compared to corn cropping systems. Bicarbonate and nitrate were not significantly different among any of the cropping systems. A strong correlation between bicarbonate and calcium suggests that agricultural lime dissolution was caused by mineral weathering, rather than by acidification due to N fertilizer applications or nitrification. An analysis of observed drainage flows, pH, and temperatures suggested that these parameters were not good indicators of differences in ionic composition.

AB  - Aerosol components and nanoparticles deriving from fuel combustion represent a class of exhaust emissions with critical relevance to environmental studies. In particular, the formation of nanoparticles is an important theme for environmental assessments of new fuel blends. Here, a set of computer simulations is carried out to study the behaviour of acetaldehyde-phenanthrene nanoparticles in relation to the influences to the three major atmospheric components CO2, O-2, N-2. The results show that phenanthrene and acetaldehyde quickly generate nanoparticles with dimensions of 2-5 nm in vacuum. The formed particles are stable in atmospheric conditions and interestingly absorb CO2 from the atmosphere-gas simulations but not O-2 and N-2. The probability of absorption of CO2 in the formed nanoparticles results as 10-20-fold compared to N-2 and O-2. Furthermore, acetaldehyde appears to localize on the surface of the formed nanoparticles, and seemingly acts with the planar geometry of phenanthrene as a facilitator for CO2 absorption. The results provided show also the properties of formed nanoparticle with higher concentrations of acetaldehyde and lower of phenanthrene, where phenanthrene forms the core of the nanoparticle, while acetaldehyde interacts with the surface and subsurface area in making their chemistry hydrophilic with a dense aromatic core. The study is important for further assessing bioethanol and fuel blends, and also introduces a methodology for studying interactions of gases and particles at the molecular level, with macroscopic significance. The study reports on growth of nanoparticles by CO2 absorption, introduces a new issue for blending fuels, with implications towards pollution profiles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural nitrogen isotope abundance (delta N-15) has been suggested as a potential indicator for discriminating organic vegetables from their conventional counterparts. However, little is known about the delta N-15 characteristic of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) under organic production and how the application of chemical fertilizers could affect this characteristic. In this study, delta N-15 characteristics of cauliflower (including the intra-plant delta N-15 characteristic) and soil under different fertilization treatments were investigated under field conditions. Five treatments were laid out: control, chemical fertilizers (F4M0), organic fertilizer (F0M4), and chemical fertilizer in combination with organic fertilizer at the ratio of 3:1 (F3M1) and 1:3 (F1M3). Results showed that plant delta N-15 was positively correlated with fertilizer delta N-15 and plant root/flower was more sensitive to changes of fertilizer delta N-15 and soil delta N-15 than leaf/stem. Distribution of delta N-15 in different plant parts (especially in flower and leaf) was significantly changed when organic fertilizers were partially or totally substituted by chemical fertilizers, suggesting a comparison of flower delta N-15 and leaf delta N-15 might be applicable for the organic identification of marketed cauliflowers. Our results provide fundamental data for the soil-and fertilizer-specific crop delta N-15 database and indicate that the intra-plant delta N-15 characteristic could be helpful for organic cauliflower identification.

AB  - This study focuses on the environmental impact assessment of three different high efficiency residential pellet boilers manufactured by an Austrian company. A Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and an Environmental Life Cycle Costing (ELCC) analysis were performed, along with air quality modelling simulations for two EU case studies to evaluate CO, PM10, SO2, NO2 concentration reductions due to the substitution of the innovative boilers in place of obsolete and non environmentally compliant biomass boilers.
   The SimaPro software (v. 8.05.13, Recipe Midpoint Method) was used for the LCA and ELCC analysis while CALPUFF (v. 6.42) was used for air quality simulations.
   Boilers emission and efficiency factors operating in real life conditions were used as input data for all environmental impact assessment analysis. Results showed an interesting reduction of both the environmental impact and pellet consumption cost (linked to the highest monetary value in the ELCC analysis) associated to the most innovative boiler model among the three envisaged. Furthermore, it emerged that air quality could be improved in the short term (2020) with the substitution of obsolete and end of life biomass boilers with high efficiency pellet boilers in EU areas where biomass is the main source of residential heating. A potential reduction of local CO, SO2 and PM10 concentrations from 9% to 23% depending on the pollutant and on the specific case study considered is found for the short term scenario (2020) with respect to the baseline scenario (2010). No significant differences in air quality were evidenced for NO2 concentrations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is more vulnerable and sensitive to climate change than many other regions worldwide because of its high altitude, permafrost geography, and harsh physical environment. As a sensitive bio-indicator of climate change, plant phenology shift in this region has been intensively studied during the recent decades, primarily based on satellite-retrieved data. However, great controversy still exists regarding the change in direction and magnitudes of spring-summer phenology. Based on a large number (11,000+ records) of long-term and continuous ground observational data for various plant species, our study intended to more comprehensively assess the changing trends of spring-summer phenology and their relationships with climatic change across the QTP. The results indicated a continuous advancement (-2.69 days decade(-1)) in spring-summer phenology from 1981 to 2011, with an even more rapid advancement during 2000-2011 (-3.13 days decade-1), which provided new field evidence for continuous advancement in spring-summer phenology across the QTP. However, diverse advancing rates in spring-summer phenology were observed for different vegetation types, thermal conditions, and seasons. The advancing trends matched well with the difference in sensitivity of spring-summer phenology to increasing temperature, implying that the sensitivity of phenology to temperature was one of the major factors influencing spring-summer phenology shifts. Besides, increased precipitation could advance the spring-summer phenology. The response of spring-summer phenology to temperature tended to be stronger from east to west across all species, while the response to precipitation showed no consistent spatial pattern.

AB  - Plant growth requires the influx of atmospheric CO2 through stomatal pores, and this carbon uptake for photosynthesis is inherently associated with a large efflux of water vapor. Under water deficit, plants reduce transpiration and are able to improve carbon for water exchange leading to higher water use efficiency (WUE). Whether increased WUE can be achieved without trade-offs in plant growth is debated. The signals mediating the WUE response under water deficit are not fully elucidated but involve the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA is perceived by a family of related receptors known to mediate acclimation responses and to reduce transpiration. We now show that enhanced stimulation of ABA signaling via distinct ABA receptors can result in plants constitutively growing at high WUE in the model species Arabidopsis. WUE was assessed by three independent approaches involving gravimetric analyses, C-13 discrimination studies of shoots and derived cellulose fractions, and by gas exchange measurements of whole plants and individual leaves. Plants expressing the ABA receptors RCAR6/PYL12 combined up to 40% increased WUE with high growth rates, i.e., are water productive. Water productivity was associated with maintenance of net carbon assimilation by compensatory increases of leaf CO2 gradients, thereby sustaining biomass acquisition. Leaf surface temperatures and growth potentials of plants growing under well-watered conditions were found to be reliable indicators for water productivity. The study shows that ABA receptors can be explored to generate more plant biomass per water transpired, which is a prime goal for a more sustainable water use in agriculture.

AB  - The knowledge of Diesel fuel properties has great relevance for the analysis and comprehension of phenomena related to fuel injection, fuel-air mixture formation and diesel combustion processes. This work proposes an alternative method for estimating the bulk modulus of diesel fuels by means of an experimental installation commonly used for determining fuel injection rates from common rail injection systems. Three fuels were tested in the mentioned installation: commercial Diesel fuel (blended with 5.8% of biodiesel), hydro-treated vegetal oil (HVO) and gas to liquid (GTL) fuel from natural gas by means of low temperature Fischer Tropsch process. Results were obtained by testing two different injectors (solenoid operated and piezoelectric injectors) under different injection pressures and energizing times. Fuel temperature at inlet of the high pressure injection pump was controlled, keeping constant the pressure inside the fuel injection indicator. From the experimental work, data analysis and post-processing, bulk modulus of fuels tested has been estimated and compared to results obtained by diverse authors with different experimental installations and methods. Results obtained in this work show small differences compared to published data. Additionally, the initial time lag between the signal of the electric pulse when the injector is energized and the beginning of the injection rate profile depends only on the type of injector without influence of type of fuel and operating conditions. However, the rear time lag between both mentioned profiles depends only on injector type (when the solenoid operated injector was tested) while, with piezoelectric injector, it also depends on both energizing time of the injector and injection pressure.

AB  - Biofiltration of an air stream polluted with diffuse CH4 concentrations of 0.19 % (v v(-1)) was carried out. These emissions can be encountered at different industrial facilities such as wastewater treatment plants and landfills. The effect of ammonium supplied in the nutrient solution was studied in a range from 0 to 1 g N-NH4+L-1, taking account its effect on CH4 removal efficiency (RE), CO2 production, ammonium conversion and the occurrence of exopolymeric substances. Additional batch assays were performed in order to evaluate the most suitable pH and temperature ranges for the biomass used as inoculum. A conventional biofilter was operated along 225 days achieving maximum CH4 elimination capacities of up to 11.2 g CH4 m(-3) h(-1), corresponding to REs of 62%, using 0.52 g N L-1 of ammonia as nitrogen source in the nutrient solution and operating at an empty bed residence time of 4.4 min. CO2 production values confirmed that most of this elimination was biological and not absorption into the liquid phase. The occurrence of instability periods resulted in a clear increase of the soluble microbial products (SMPs) contained in the liquid phase, especially in the protein fraction, which could be used as a monitoring tool to follow the stress conditions of the biofilter. Results indicate interesting links between the performance of the biofilter and the presence of extracellular polysaccharide and protein concentration in the liquid phase, with increasing concentrations detected when the process was not stable.

AB  - Diagnostic and prognostic indicators are key components to achieve the goal of personalized cancer therapy. Two distinct approaches to this goal include predicting response by genetic analysis and direct testing of possible therapies using cultures derived from biopsy specimens. Optimally, the latter method requires a rapid assessment, but growing xenograft tumors or developing patient-derived cell lines can involve a great deal of time and expense. Furthermore, tumor cells have much different responses when grown in 2D versus 3D tissue environments. Using a modification of existing methods, we show that it is possible to make tumor-fragment (TF) spheroids in only 2-3 days. TF spheroids appear to closely model characteristics of the original tumor and may be used to assess critical therapy-modulating features of the microenvironment such as hypoxia. A similar method allows the reproducible development of spheroids from mixed tumor cells and fibroblasts (mixed-cell spheroids). Prior literature reports have shown highly variable development and properties of mixed-cell spheroids and this has hampered the detailed study of how individual tumor-cell components interact. In this study, we illustrate this approach and describe similarities and differences using two tumor models (U87 glioma and SQ20B squamous-cell carcinoma) with supporting data from additional cell lines. We show that U87 and SQ20B spheroids predict a key microenvironmental factor in tumors (hypoxia) and that SQ20B cells and spheroids generate similar numbers of microvesicles. We also present pilot data for miRNA expression under conditions of cells, tumors, and TF spheroids.

AB  - Graywater (GW) reuse for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. One of the major impediments to GW reuse is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. This study monitored three similar on-site GW treatment systems hi-monthly over the course of a year to compare the presence of pathogens and indicators in raw, biologically treated, and biologically treated and disinfected by chlorine and ultraviolet light (UV)] GW. The systems were designed to allow the testing of the same batch (collection) of water as it passed through the treatment chain. The samples were analyzed using standard culture-dependent methods and the data were compared to culture-independent DNA-based methods. Results suggested that the presence and abundance of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Entero coccus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa differ among the various GW streams (e.g. raw, biologically treated, and disinfected). The culture-dependent analyses suggested that both chlorine and UV inactivate most of the bacteria tested in the biologically treated GW, albeit at different efficiencies. Conversely, the DNA-based analyses indicated no significant differences in pathogenic bacterial abundance between the biologically treated GW with or without disinfection. To better understand the discrepancies between the results, we repeated the analysis in the laboratory under controlled conditions using Enterococcus faecalis as a model bacterium and obtained similar results. We suggest that disinfection of biologically treated GW with chlorine or UV is effective for treating pathogens, but that the inactivation efficiency cannot be estimated by DNA-based qPCR.

AB  - Coal nitrogen has two modes of occurrence, bound to organic matter and fixed into ammonian illite (fixed-NH4), with the organic nitrogen mode being dominant Organic nitrogen geochemical characteristics (isotopic ratio and content) can serve as indicators of certain geological processes, and therefore, understanding the geochemical behavior of organic nitrogen in coal is important. A total of 25 coal samples were collected from Qinshui Coalfield, North China, and Kjeldahl and Rittenberg analyses were used to determine the organic nitrogen content (N-dmmf) and isotopic ratio (delta N-15(dmmf)) of these coals, respectively. Results indicate that the organic nitrogen content in the Permo-Carboniferous coals of Onshui Coalfield averages 0.99%, consistent with Chinese coals. The delta N-15(dmmf) averages +3.85%., which is higher than that of Chinese coals. Major geological factors influencing the organic nitrogen geochemistry of Qinshui coals include coalification, depositional environment, and coal-forming age. A multiple linear regression model was used to quantitatively examine the relationship of Ndmmf and delta N-15(dmmf) to these geological factors and their degree of influence on the organic nitrogen geochemistry. The N-dmmf shows a significantly decreasing trend with coalification and is influenced by depositional environment and coal-forming age to a relatively smaller extent. The delta N-15(dmmf) is mainly influenced by coalification and coal-forming age, followed by depositional environment. As maturity increases, the delta N-15(dmmf) increases significantly. Carboniferous coals have a higher delta N-15(dmmf) than the Permian ones due to mantle outgassing and differences in the climatic conditions during their formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the last millennia, all forests of the Italian Alps have been heavily affected by human land-use. Consequently, forest structures have been modified, and there are no old growth remains. In the last decades, however, many forests have been withdrawn from regular management, because wood production was unprofitable, and left to develop naturally. At the same time, in currently managed forests, silvicultural systems able to develop or maintain old-growth characteristics are being required. The aim of this paper was to assess the status and developmental dynamics of old-growth characteristics in mixed beech, silver fir, and Norway spruce montane forests of the eastern Italian Alps. We selected along a naturalness gradient (a) three old-growth forests in Bosnia and Montenegro (due to the lack of old-growth forests in the Italian Alps), (b) two forests withdrawn from regular management for at least 50 years, and (c) three currently managed forests. In each forest, we analysed 17 structural attributes, in order to assess their value as indicators of old-growth condition. Old-growth forests were characterized by significantly higher amounts of live and dead biomass, share of beech in the dominant and regeneration layers, and number of large trees. The diameter distribution was best described as a rotated sigmoid, differently from currently and formerly managed forest. We discuss the differences in old-growth characteristics across the management gradient and use our results to evaluate the effectiveness of retention prescriptions currently applied in the studied regions in maintaining or promoting old-growth structural attributes in managed forests.

AB  - The termination of the African Humid Period in northeastern Africa during the early Holocene was marked by the southward migration of the rain belt and the disappearance of the Green Sahara. This interval of drastic environmental changes was also marked by the initiation of food production by North African hunter-gatherer populations and thus provides critical information on human-environment relationships. However, existing records of regional climatic and environmental changes exhibit large differences in timing and modes of the wet/dry transition at the end of the African Humid Period. Here we present independent records of changes in river runoff, vegetation and erosion in the Nile River watershed during the Holocene obtained from a unique sedimentary sequence on the Nile River fan using organic and inorganic proxy data. This high-resolution reconstruction allows to examine the phase relationship between the changes of these three parameters and provides a detailed picture of the environmental conditions during the Paleolithic/Neolithic transition. The data show that river runoff decreased gradually during the wet/arid transition at the end of the AHP whereas rapid shifts of vegetation and erosion occurred earlier between 8.7 and similar to 6 ka BP. These asynchronous changes are compared to other regional records and provide new insights into the threshold responses of the environment to climatic changes. Our record demonstrates that the degradation of the environment in northeastern Africa was more abrupt and occurred earlier than previously thought and may have accelerated the process of domestication in order to secure sustainable food resources for the Neolithic African populations.

AB  - Alternative cropping systems such as conservation agriculture have been implemented to limit the harmful effects of intensive conventional cropping systems. Conservation agriculture is known to modify the structural diversity of earthworm communities, but no data have been reported so far on their functional diversity. Structural and functional indices of community were used to study the effects of different soil tillage intensity on earthworm diversity in arable soils.
   Field data were collected in four agricultural trials across France representing different soiland climatic conditions. Three types of soil tillage were assessed: plowing, superficial tillage and direct seeding. Earthworm abundance, species richness and ecomorphological group abundance were investigated. Seven functional traits, i.e. body length, body mass/length ratio, epithelium type, cocoon diameter, typhlosolis type, carbon preferences and vertical distribution, were selected according to their hypothesized link with mechanisms of tillage impact. Functional diversity indices were then computed. Soil tillage intensity decreased functional diversity and modified the functional trait profile within the earthworm community whereas neither structural diversity (species number) nor abundance changed with tillage intensity. Differences between plowing and direct seeding were significant in each trial, and superficial tillage often showed intermediate trait values. Regarding ecomorphological groups, anecic abundance was positively influenced by a decrease in soil tillage, contrary to epigeic and endogeic earthworms that showed no response. Tillage acts as an environmental filter, and decreasing its intensity caused a lesser convergence of traits and thus higher functional trait diversity. We demonstrated that a trait-based approach better permitted comparisons of community responses across sites than species number or abundance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vertical behavior of cultured chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, in a net-cage was investigated using depth data logger and infrared video camera footage during the spawning and non-spawning seasons. Marked differences in the vertical distributions of spawning and non-spawning mackerel were observed. Non-spawning mackerel swam near the bottom of the net-cage during the daytime, coming up to shallow waters during night-time. However, spawning mackerel remained near the bottom of the net at all times except for brief, night-time visits to the surface for gamete release. Spawning events started with the school of fish whirling near the surface, before two or three fish, possibly the female followed by the males, darted upward and away from the school at high speed. Once away from the school, the fish swam in a tight circle two or three times before releasing their eggs and sperm. Estimation of the timing of spawning events based on back-calculations of egg development and then correlating these data with changes in vertical movements revealed that there were 26 events over a three-day period, and that most events occurred between sunset and midnight. Differences in the depth distribution between the spawning season and the non-spawning season could potentially be used as new indicator for the spawning period in chub mackerel reared under artificial conditions. These results could help us to better understand the spawning season in mackerel and allow us to increase the sustainability of the natural reproductive process in captivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB  - Leaf chlorophyll content is an important physiological parameter which can serve as an indicator of nutritional status, plant stress or senescence. Signals proportional to the chlorophyll content can be measured non-destructively with instruments detecting leaf transmittance (e.g., SPAD-502) or reflectance (e.g., showing normalized differential vegetation index, NDVI) in red and near infrared spectral regions. The measurements are based on the assumption that only chlorophylls absorb in the examined red regions. However, there is a question whether accumulation of other pigments (e.g., anthocyanins) could in some cases affect the chlorophyll meter readings. To answer this question, we cultivated tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) for a long time under low light conditions and then exposed them for several weeks (4 h a day) to high sunlight containing the UV-A spectral region. The senescent leaves of these plants evolved a high relative content of anthocyanins and visually revealed a distinct blue color. The SPAD and NDVI data were collected and the spectra of diffusive transmittance and reflectance of the leaves were measured using an integration sphere. The content of anthocyanins and chlorophylls was measured analytically. Our results show that SPAD and NDVI measurement can be significantly affected by the accumulated anthocyanins in the leaves with relatively high anthocyanin content. To describe theoretically this effect of anthocyanins, concepts of a specific absorbance and a leaf spectral polarity were developed. Corrective procedures of the chlorophyll meter readings for the anthocyanin contribution are suggested both for the transmittance and reflectance mode.

KW  - LIFE
AB  - Background: Well-being is an important health outcome and a potential national indicator of policy success. There is a need for longitudinal epidemiological surveys to understand determinants of well-being. This study examines the role of personal social support and psychosocial work environment as predictors of well-being in an occupational cohort study.
   Methods: Social support and work characteristics were measured by questionnaire in 5182 United Kingdom civil servants from phase 1 of the Whitehall II study and were used to predict subjective well-being assessed using the Affect Balance Scale (range -15 to 15, SD = 4.2) at phase 2. External assessments of job control and demands were provided by personnel managers.
   Results: Higher levels of well-being were predicted by high levels of confiding/emotional support (difference in mean from the reference group with low levels of confiding/emotional support = 0.63, 95% CI 0.38-0.89, p(trend)<0.001), high control at work (0.57, 95% CI 0.31-0.83, p(trend)<0.001; reference low control) and low levels of job strain (0.60, 95% CI 0.31-0.88; reference high job strain), after adjusting for a range of confounding factors and affect balance score at baseline. Higher externally assessed work pace was also associated with greater well-being.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the psychosocial work environment and personal relationships have independent effects on subjective well-being. Policies designed to increase national well-being should take account of the quality of working conditions and factors that facilitate positive personal relationships. Policies designed to improve workplaces should focus not only on minimising negative aspects of work but also on increasing the positive aspects of work.

AB  - Small-scale irrigation initiatives are expanding rapidly in Burkina Faso. However, in many cases optimal yields are not being obtained despite the available water and the required nutrient applications. Local stakeholders need an easy-to-use decision-support tool to assess irrigation water use and its impact on yield. In this study, a water-driven crop model, AquaCrop, developed by FAO, was adapted for cabbage (Brassica oleracea L) using a limited dataset and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The experiment was conducted in south-western Burkina Faso on small irrigated farmer plots, where optimal managerial conditions could not always be guaranteed. Statistical indicators - normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) and index of agreement (d) - suggested that the model is very reliable for simulating cabbage biomass yield and soil water content (low nRMSE and d-index near 1). The relationship between observed and simulated yield produced a d-index of 0.99 and an nRMSE of 1.39% (or 0.59 ton/ha). The comparison between observed and modeled soil water content gave a d-index of 0.90 and an nRMSE of 4.38% (or 9.13 mm). Also of interest was the indirect link between plant density and yield via maximum canopy cover, which can considerably simplify yield estimation. It was concluded that AquaCrop was a very useful tool for enabling local end-users to evaluate and optimize cabbage yield and irrigation water use. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrate contamination of groundwater under land used for intensive-agriculture is probably the most worrisome agro-hydrological sustainability problem worldwide. Vadose-zone samples from 0 to 9 m depth under citrus orchards overlying an unconfined aquifer were analyzed for variables controlling water flow and the fate and transport of nitrogen fertilizers. Steady-state estimates of water and NO3-N fluxes to groundwater were found to vary spatially in the ranges of 90-330 mm yr(-1) and 50-220 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Calibration of transient models to two selected vadose-zone profiles required limiting the concentration of NO3-N in the solution that is taken up by the roots to 30 mg L-1. Results of an independent lysimeter experiment showed a similar nitrogen-uptake regime. Simulations of past conditions revealed a significant correlation between NO3-N flux to groundwater and the previous year's precipitation. Simulations of different nitrogen-application rates showed that using half of the nitrogen fertilizer added to the irrigation water by farmers would reduce average NO3-N flux to groundwater by 70%, decrease root nitrogen uptake by 20% and reduce the average pore water NO3-N concentration in the deep vadose zone to below the Israeli drinking water standard; hence this rate of nitrogen application was found to be agro-hydrologically sustainable. Beyond the investigation of nitrate fluxes to groundwater under citrus orchards and the interesting case-study aspects, this work demonstrates a methodology that enables skillful decisions concerning joint sustainability of both the water resource and agricultural production in a common environmental setting.

AB  - Palynological records from Holocene wetland deposits in East Polynesia have demonstrated widespread ecological changes following Polynesian arrival after c. ad 1200, but linking inferences of human activities to archaeological records has been limited by equivocal fossil proxies and a lack of chronological controls. To address these limitations, multiple sedimentary profiles were examined from a coastal marsh on the remote East Polynesian island of Rapa. These profiles span 8000 years of ecological change and record mid-Holocene sea-level highstand conditions which receded to modern levels by ad 500. Depositional models were constructed for each profile using Bayesian inferences to characterise the spatial and temporal changes in fossil proxy representation. Just prior to human arrival there are high pollen concentrations of Pandanus and the presence of an extinct palm, both indicative of an extensive lowland swamp forest that developed after ad 500. Indicators of Polynesian arrival and agricultural expansion include unprecedented amounts of charcoal particles and pollen from the introduced cultigen, Colocasia esculenta (taro). The swamp forest was progressively cleared, beginning in the most inland section at ad 1110-1230. The Colocasia-based agricultural system reached its greatest extent from ad 1590 to 1740. The last appearance of the extinct palm was recorded at ad 1520-1660 and the entire area was cleared of indigenous trees soon after European colonisation at ad 1830-1880. By modelling the chronologies of individual fossil proxies across each profile, we have developed a framework for defining the processes behind vegetation change and for matching palynological-based inferences of human activity with archaeological records.

AB  - Metal wastes have been repeatedly shown to significantly disturb periphytic communities. This study considers an industrial contamination site subjected to remediation processes since 2007. With the aim of finding relevant bioindicators of the restoration capacity of such impacted hydrosystems, this study focussed on biofilm and diatom recovery kinetics. Biofilms were colonised at a reference site and in parallel at a metal-contaminated site. After 24 days, contaminated biofilms were translocated to the reference site to study the biofilm recovery potential for 9 weeks under natural conditions. Analyses from the community level - measures of metal bioaccumulation. cell densities and taxonomic investigations - to the individual level - measures of teratological forms - were performed. The results showed that Zn and Cd contents were rapidly depurated, reaching reference levels 3 and 9 weeks after translocadon, respectively. A Principal Response Curve (PRC) analysis enabled to see the fast evolution of diatom communities, with species specific to the reference site growing in decontaminated biofilms from the 3rd week. After 9 weeks, we estimated that diatom community restructuring was complete, based on measurements of biovolumes and teratological form rates which both decreased to reference levels in decontaminated biofilms throughout the experiment. The different teratological types appeared to be good bioindicators of biofilm contamination and shed light on the duration of contamination. According to these results, different criteria can provide information on the recovery potential of periphyton. Biofilms proved to be good bioindicators of metal recovery and diatoms proved to be good bioindicators of community recovery. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We studied the structure and species composition of nine residual forest stands of Dacryodes excelsa (tabonuco), a dominant vegetation type in the moist and wet lower montane forests of the Caribbean. The stands were scattered over three different landscapes with different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance: forested, shade coffee, and tobacco. We compared our results with data from undisturbed stands inside a protected and forested landscape to see how the type of landscape that surrounded them affected the structure and species composition of the residual forest stands. In the process we sought conservation lessons that would help restore degraded tabonuco forests to original conditions. Tree density, basal area, and species density all increased with elevation. We found 98 tree species, including 50 of the 83 species that we identified as belonging to undisturbed tabonuco forests (including 13 of 18 endemic tree species), 41 tree species not reported for undisturbed tabonuco forests, eight primary forest species, and six introduced species. When ordered by species Importance Value by site, the stands in nine sites separated into three general groups corresponding to landscape type: (1) Heavily used for tobacco production. (2) Shade coffee, and (3) Forested. The importance of introduced species increased, and the abundance of tabonuco forest indicator species and endemic species decreased with increased anthropogenic disturbances. When restoring tabonuco forests, it is necessary to understand the landscape forces that influence the species composition of these forests. It appears that particular species combinations are natural outcomes of the level of anthropogenic activity in the landscape and reversing those tendencies might be impractical or too costly.

AB  - High levels of Escherichia coli were frequently detected in tropical soils in Hawaii, which present important environmental sources of E. coli to water bodies. This study systematically examined E. coli isolates from water and soil of several watersheds in Hawaii and observed high overall genotypic diversity (35.5% unique genotypes). In the Manoa watershed, fewer than 9.3% of the observed E. coli genotypes in water and 6.6% in soil were shared between different sampling sites, suggesting the lack of dominant fecal sources in the watershed. High temporal variability of E. coli genotypes in soil was also observed, which suggests a dynamic E. coli population corresponding with the frequently observed high concentrations in tropical soils. When E. coli genotypes detected from the same sampling events were compared, limited sharing between the soil and water samples was observed in the majority of comparisons (73.5%). However, several comparisons reported up to 33.3% overlap of E. coli genotypes between soil and water, illustrating the potential for soil-water interactions under favorable environmental conditions. In addition, genotype accumulation curves for E. coli from water and soil indicated that the sampling efforts in the Manoa watershed could not exhaust the overall genotypic diversity. Comparisons of E. coli genotypes from other watersheds on Oahu, Hawaii, identified no apparent grouping according to sampling locations. The results of the present study demonstrate the complexity of using E. coli as a fecal indicator bacterium in tropical watersheds and highlight the need to differentiate environmental sources of E. coli from fecal sources in water quality monitoring.

AB  - Dexamethasone is one of a number of synthetic corticosteroids illegally used to promote growth in food-producing animals. Since these low-level drug cocktails evade detection by currently available chemical methods, simple biological indicators that can aid in laboratory analysis are needed. In an attempt to devise an accurate biological method that could detect illicit drug treatment in food-producing animals, we characterized microscopic morphologic alterations of the thymus in veal calves administered low-dose dexamethasone versus control animals. For this purpose, 122 male calves were farmed for 6 months in controlled condition: 81 animals were orally administered dexamethasone (0.4 mg day(-1)) for 20 days during the sixth month and the remaining 41 were kept as control. Urine samples were collected systematically during the treatment period, the suspension period and at the slaughterhouse. All animals were slaughtered 10 per day starting from 10 days after the last dexamethasone administration and the thymus was sampled for histological examination. The difference between the two animal groups was evaluated by means of a non-parametric test of hypothesis. No residues were detected in the urines collected since the third day after the last administration, whereas morphometric analysis of the thoracic thymus revealed a significant decrease in the cortex: medulla ratio in the treated animals (p<0.0005). We can conclude that this histological approach offers encouraging prospects as a screening method to overcome current limitations in controlling growth promoter abuse.

AB  - Exposure of rats to environmental heat enhances the expression of heat shock protein-72 (Hsp-72) in most of their organs proportionally to heat stress severity. Pre-induction or over-expression of Hsp-72 prevents organ damage and lethality, suggesting that heat shock proteins (Hsps) may have a pathogenic role in this condition. We investigated the expression profile of Hsps in baboons subjected to environmental heat stress until the core temperature attained 42.5A degrees C (moderate heatstroke) or occurrence of hypotension associated with core temperature a parts per thousand yen43.5A degrees C (severe heatstroke). Western blot analysis demonstrated a differential induction of Hsp-72 among organs of heat-stressed animals with the highest induction in the liver and the lowest in lung. Hsp-60 and Hsc-70 expression was similar between control and heat-stressed animals. ELISA studies indicated a marked release of Hsp-72 into the circulation of baboons with severe heatstroke with a peak at 24 h post-heatstroke onset and remained sustained up to 72 h. Hsp-72 release was not associated with core temperature or systolic blood pressure, but correlated with markers of liver, myocardium, and skeletal muscle tissue necrosis. Non-survivors displayed significantly higher Hsp-72 levels than survivors. No Hsp-60 was detected in the circulation. These findings add further evidence that increased expression of Hsp-72 may be an important component of the host response to severe heatstroke. They also suggest that extracellular Hsp-72 is a marker of multiple organs tissue damage. Whether extracellular Hsp-72 plays a role in the host immune response to heat stress merits further studies.

AB  - Wildfires are a recurrent disturbance in the Mediterranean Basin. However, managers from this region are confronted with a lack of information on the effects of fire on most woody species, which is required for defining sustainable forest management strategies. Following a large wildfire in central Portugal (2003), we surveyed the area during the first year and assessed the vegetative condition of 1040 burned trees from 11 different species. Among those trees, 755 individuals were selected and monitored annually for 4 years. At the end of the study, almost all the broadleaved trees survived, while most coniferous died. In spite of the low mortality observed in broadleaves, most were top-killed and regenerated only from basal resprouts, which implies a slow recovering process. Quercus suber, however, showed vigorous post-fire crown resprouting and was the most resilient species. We fitted logistic regression models to predict the probability of individual tree mortality and top-kill from fire injury indicators and tree characteristics. Besides the differences between the two main functional groups (coniferous, broadleaved), bole char height and crown volume scorched or consumed were important predictors of tree responses. Additionally, the main factor determining crown mortality on broadleaved species was bark thickness. The selected models performed well when tested with independent data obtained on four other wildfires. These models have several potential applications and can be useful to managers making pre-fire or post-fire decisions in mixed forest stands in the western Mediterranean Basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The method exploits the possibilities of flow injection gradient titration in a system of reversed flow with spectrophotometric detection. In the developed approach a small amount of titrant (EDTA) is injected into a stream of sample containing a mixture of indicators (sulfosalicylic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline). In acid environment sulfosalicylic acid forms a complex with Fe(III), whereas 1,10-phenanthroline forms a complex with Fe(II). Measurements are performed at wavelength lambda = 530 nm when radiation is absorbed by both complexes. After injection EDTA replaces sulfosalicylic acid and forms with Fe(III) more stable colourless complex. As a result, a characteristic "cut off' peak is registered with a width corresponding to the Fe(III) concentration and with a height corresponding to the Fe(II) concentration. Calibration was performed by titration of four two-component standard solutions of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) concentrations established in accordance with 22 factorial plan. The method was tested with the use of synthetic samples and then it was applied to the analysis of water samples taken from artesian wells. Under optimized experimental conditions Fe(II) and Fe(III) were determined with precision less than 0.8 and 2.5% (RSD) and accuracy less than 3.2 and 5.1% (relative error) within the concentration ranges of 0.1-3.0 and 0.9-3.5 mg L(-1) of both analytes, respectively.

AB  - Background: Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted by muroid rodents, including laboratory mice and rats, are used as phenotypic markers in behavioral assays and biomedical research. Interpretation of these USVs depends on understanding the significance of USV production by rodents in the wild. However, there has never been a study of muroid rodent ultrasound function in the wild and comparisons of USVs produced by wild and laboratory rodents are lacking to date. Here, we report the first comparison of wild and captive rodent USVs recorded from the same species, Peromyscus californicus.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We used standard ultrasound recording techniques to measure USVs from California mice in the laboratory ( Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center, SC, USA) and the wild ( Hastings Natural History Reserve, CA, USA). To determine which California mouse in the wild was vocalizing, we used a remote sensing method that used a 12-microphone acoustic localization array coupled with automated radio telemetry of all resident Peromyscus californicus in the area of the acoustic localization array. California mice in the laboratory and the wild produced the same types of USV motifs. However, wild California mice produced USVs that were 2-8 kHz higher in median frequency and significantly more variable in frequency than laboratory California mice.
   Significance: The similarity in overall form of USVs from wild and laboratory California mice demonstrates that production of USVs by captive Peromyscus is not an artifact of captivity. Our study validates the widespread use of USVs in laboratory rodents as behavioral indicators but highlights that particular characteristics of laboratory USVs may not reflect natural conditions.

AB  - Aims:
   In the present study, chromogenic (red) bacteria were used to simulate actual target bacteria during set-up and optimization of an isolation process of bacteria, designed for food samples. Isolation of bacteria from food in the context of molecular biological detection of food pathogens is a multistep process. Development of such a separation method requires continuous monitoring of the location of the presumable targets in the sample tubes. Therefore, red-coloured pigmented bacteria were used as substitutes for the actual target bacteria, during the establishment of a new sample preparation technique.
   Methods and Results:
   The chromogenic bacteria Micrococcus roseus and Serratia marcescens were confirmed to withstand the physical (e.g. centrifugal forces) and chemical (e.g. lysis buffer composition) conditions required during establishment of the new technique. Furthermore, the suitability of these model bacteria to substitute for the actual target pathogens (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes) was assured by testing the physical properties of the model bacteria with respect to the proposed separation methods.
   Conclusion:
   Visibility of the pigmented bacteria within the complex sample matrices served to allocate bacterial content during the various steps necessary for finalization of the method protocol. The presumptive bacterial targets can be allocated simply by visualization of their bright red colour silhouetted against the background sample matrix.
   Significance and Impact of Study:
   The use of pigmented bacteria as substitutes for actual colourless target bacteria during design and development of a bacterial isolation method is a simple and inexpensive application. It saves a huge amount of time and resources, as the proof of principle of new methods is possible in rapid succession.

AB  - A continuous, 13-yr record of environmental data and phytoplankton species and assemblage structure in the mesohaline Neuse River Estuary (biweekly, April-October; monthly, November-March) was used to evaluate phytoplankton assemblage responses to changing environmental conditions. Ordination techniques including nonmetric multidimensional scaling, indicator species analysis, and BIO-ENV software were used to investigate potential environmental predictors of phytoplankton assemblage patterns under chronic eutrophication. Phytoplankton assemblages were strongly related to temperature and total nitrogen : total phosphorus ratios, with expected seasonal changes in species composition. Interannual changes in river discharge influenced whether phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by diatoms and phototrophic flagellates or by mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Increasing ammonium concentrations also have been an important influence on phytoplankton assemblages. Raphidophytes ( including the potentially toxic species Heterosigma akashiwo), haptophytes, chlorophytes, and the bloom-forming dinoflagellate Heterocapsa rotundata have increased in more recent years (2000-2006), concomitant with increasing ammonium concentrations. Abundance of the potentially toxic dinoflagellates Prorocentrum minimum and the grouping Pfiesteria spp., "pfiesteria-like'' dinoflagellates, and Karlodinium veneficum remained stationary over time and rarely exceeded 103 cells mL(-1). Abundance of P. minimum was positively related to dissolved organic nitrogen and suspended solids concentrations, whereas the highest abundance of the grouping Pfiesteria spp., "pfiesteria-like'' dinoflagellates, and K. veneficum occurred during summer and fall, related to high total phosphorus concentrations, temperature, and salinity. Overall, this study provides new species-level insights to advance understanding about anthropogenic influences on phytoplankton assemblages. The data suggest an increasingly important role of ammonium in controlling phytoplankton assemblage structure, including increased abundance of some harmful species, in eutrophic estuaries.

AB  - Wells in the Orpheus graben encountered the most proximal part of the deltaic Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Scotian Basin. More distal sandstones are important gas reservoir rocks, with good reservoir quality where Fe-rich chlorite (chamosite) rims on framework grains have inhibited quartz cementation. Cutting samples from the Orpheus graben show the presence of Fe-rich sheet silicates (berthierine or chamosite) and early diagenetic phosphorite. These minerals were analyzed by electron microprobe, and their textures were mapped with backscattered electron images. Studies in the North Sea have shown a relationship between high phosphorus and the presence of good chlorite rims in reservoir rocks. The mineralization of pore-water phosphorus, instead of its return to seawater, is favored by Fe-rich sediments and sorption on iron oxides during shallow sea-floor diagenesis. The Fe, Ti, and P contents are uncommonly high in Scotian Basin shales compared with global average shale compositions. The uncommon occurrence of inner-shelf phosphorite in this study is interpreted to be a consequence of the same high Fe content of the sediment that also favors the formation of Fe-rich sheet silicates. In rapidly deposited deltaic sandstones of the offshore reservoirs, the dominance of type 3 kerogen led to sulfate depletion occurring at depths of tens of meters and a corresponding great thickness for overlying Eh (oxidation potential)-controlled diagenetic zones. The thick Fe-reduction zone allowed the formation of early diagenetic berthierine, which on burial formed the chamosite rims that resulted in the improved reservoir quality in sandstones. The distribution of phosphorus minerals may be an indicator of conditions suitable for berthierine formation.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) emission from agriculture is an environmental and health concern in many nations, and has trans-border impacts. Direct toxicity, terrestrial eutrophication and production of inhalable aerosols (< 2.5 mu m diameter) are the specific concerns. Canada, among other northern hemisphere nations, has computed a national inventory of NH3 emissions, and a new emission inventory estimate is being prepared jointly under the National Agri-Environmental Health Analysis and Reporting Program (NAHARP) and National Agri-Environmental Standards Initiative (NAESI). However, there has been a rapid evolution in the models used, and a concomitant change in the NH3- specific data required. This paper compares several model structures and options using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis methods. The results indicate the more recent models, that compute a mass balance of NH3 from excretion to landspreading, have tended to focus uncertainty onto the dietary efficiency of animal N nutrition. After excretion, the total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) in the manure contributes to NH3 emissions at each stage as the manure passes from the animal housing to storage and to landspreading. There are many variants of these processes because every farm is different, resulting in diminished sensitivity to any one NH3-loss mechanism after excretion. This finding suggests that although NH3-emission factors, the empirical data at the core of the models, are not well characterised (especially for Canadian conditions), it is at least as important to expend research effort on factors that influence TAN excretion. Results of this paper will also guide development of the NAHARP/NAESI model.

AB  - A small pond containing the charophyte Chara hispida was monitored over a one-year period for changes in growth, water chemistry, water level and stable isotopic composition. Chara growth was found to be seasonal, with maximum growth occurring from late April to July During this period, pH rose to > 10 while the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and calcium fell as a result of photosynthesis and calcification. Large gradients in pH, water temperature and irradiance were found within the Chara sward and measurements showed that most growth and photosynthesis occurred within the upper 20 cm of the water column. Chara oospore formation was also found to be seasonal but dependent upon environmental conditions.
   delta O-18(w), rose rapidly during summer as evaporation progressed and this was correlated with the delta O-18(DIC), and to some extent with delta O-18(c), of the Chara encrusted calcite. However, extreme isotopic disequilibrium was observed between the delta O-18(c) and the delta O-18(w) and also between the delta C-13(c) and the delta C-13(DIC). This arose from the high pH allowing atmospheric CO2 to enter the water and combine directly with OH-.
   It is concluded that, within shallow eutrophic lakes containing Chara swards, inferences of climate (e.g. air temperature) cannot be made from observations of the isotopic composition of Chara carbonates. However in combination with other geochemical data, disequilibrium events may be identifiable in ancient lake basins and taken as evidence for lake shallowing and/or eutrophication.

AB  - Based on the analysis of the subjectivity of wetland boundary criteria and their causes at present, this paper suggested that, under the condition that the mechanism of wetland formation process has not been understood, "black box" method of System Theory can be used to delineate wetland boundaries scientifically. After analyzing the difference of system construction among aquatic habitats, wetlands and uplands, the lower limit of rooted plants was chosen as the lower boundary criterion of wetlands. Because soil diagnostic horizon is the result of the long-term interaction among all environments, and it is less responsive than vegetation to short-term change, soil diagnostic horizon was chosen as the indicator to delineate wetland upper boundary, which lies at the thinning-out point of soil diagnostic horizon. Case study indicated that it was feasible using the lower limit of rooted plants and the thinning-out point of soil diagnostic horizon as criteria to delineate the lower and upper boundaries of wetland. In the study area, the thinning-out line of albic horizon was coincident with the 55.74m contour line, the maximum horizon error was less than 1m, and the maximum vertical error less than 0.04m. The problem on wetland definition always arises on the boundaries. Having delineated wetland boundaries, wetlands can be defined as follows: wetlands are the transitional zones between uplands and deepwater habitats, they are a kind of azonal complex that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water, with the lower boundary lying at the lower limit of rooted plants, and the upper boundary at the thinning-out line of upland soil diagnostic horizon.

AB  - Diatom analyses in the water column, sediment traps, surficial sediments as well as in a short sediment core from Hagelseewli (2339 m asl, Swiss Alps) give information about the present-day seasonal cycle of diatom blooms, taphonomic processes in the lake basin and the lake's history. Analyses of surficial sediments show that water depth and thus light and nutrient availability is the most important factor influencing the production and distribution of diatom assemblages in Hagelseewli, and that periphytic diatom valves deposited in the deeper part of the basin originate from the shallow, littoral parts and are transported to the central part by processes such as lateral currents or sediment focussing. The lake is characterised by a very short period (2-3 months) of open water. Water-column and sediment-trap data revealed that planktonic diatoms bloom during and after the ice break-up, whereas mainly periphytic Fragilaria species entered the traps during the ice-covered period. These results suggest that plankton development is strongly inhibited by the ice-cover, with longer periods of ice-cover favouring Fragilaria species in Hagelseewli. The diatom analysis of a short sediment core that includes the last five centuries revealed several changes in the proportion of planktonic diatoms to Fragilaria species. The colder phases of the Little Ice-Age correspond to phases of lower concentration of planktonic diatoms. The highest, statistically significant amount of variance in the downcore diatom data is explained by winter precipitation, which directly influences the length of the ice-cover but inversely influences the light regime.

AB  - Net-pen aquaculture provides the large quantities of fish needed to supplement an increasing consumer demand, but it is also a source of nutrient enrichment to the surrounding ecosystem. Nutrient enrichment can result in measurable increases in phytoplankton growth, but in flowing water, such measurements are difficult and may not be appropriate. An increased awareness of the link between hypernutrification and increased prevalence of nuisance algal blooms heighten this concern. We present a method based on standard lipidology techniques that uses periphyton growth as an indicator of phytoplankton response to nutrient enrichment. Chlorophyll a (Chi a) measurements of phototrophic biomass were used to determine phytoplankton and periphyton response to nutrient stimuli and periphyton growth rates at field sites near net-pen aquaculture facilities. Laboratory trials showed that phytoplankton and periphyton communities responded similarly to both nutrient sufficient and nutrient-limiting conditions. When sufficient nutrients were present, both phytoplankton and periphyton biomass did not increase during two-day incubations. The addition of plant nutrients during periods of nutrient limitation induced increases of 122 to 175% in phytoplankton biomass and 139 to 221% in periphyton biomass. The similarity in response suggests that the periphyton response would be an accurate descriptor of phytoplankton response. Preliminary field studies showed that reproducible periphyton growth rates (coefficient of variation <10%) were obtained at growth rates greater than 20.0 ng Chi a cm(-2) day(-1). Periphyton growth rates ranged from 6.0 to 80.0 ng Chl a cm(-2) day(-1), and were locally enhanced (2.5X that of ambient station) down-current of a freshwater net-pen. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - USE OF A KERNEL MILKLINE SCORE TO DETERMINE STAGE OF MATURITY IN MAIZE CROPS HARVESTED FOR SILAGE
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA  - English
KW  - LINE
AB  - A scoring system based on the position of the boundary (milkline) between the solid starch phase and the liquid phase on the surface of the maize kernel was evaluated as an indicator of crop stage of maturity. Milkline score (MLS) varies from 0 when the kernel contents are all liquid and no milkline is visible to 5 when the kernel contents are all solid and grain filling is complete. The scoring sytem is continuous in intervals of 0.5 units.
   The MLS was linearly related to the dry matter (DM) content of the crop in experiments at Nowra (R(2) = 0.72), Wagga Wagga (R(2) = 0.82), and Grafton (R(2) = 0.65). The predicted dry matter content at MLS 2.5 was 34.2% at Nowra, 36.0% at Wagga Wagga, and 33.7% at Grafton. Under normal seasonal conditions, milkline scoring can be used by farmers to help decide when their crops are ready for harvest. Crop DM is optimal for silage productions when MLS is in the range 2-3. However, the technique may not be reliable with severely stressed crops.
   Sampling 10 cobs from an area of 0.25 ha gave a 95% confidence of detecting the MLS with a precision +/-0.37 unit. At Nowra the milkline moved down the kernel at a rate of 1 MLS unit/9 days. This rate may be different in other environments. At the same site there was a significant (P<0.05) quadratic relationship between milkline score and DM yield, with maximum yield obtained at MLS 3.4. However, this relationship accounted for only 16.76% of the variation, and clearly, other factors influenced DM yield.

AB  - Based on the physicochemical characteristics, metals emitted from the source (both natural and anthropogenic) contributes towards spatial continuity at a regional scale. Apart from the intrinsic properties of metals, meteorological conditions and topography of the region are also known to contribute towards spatial continuity. In the present study, a comparative spatial assessment of 12 metals in lichen Phaeophyscia hispidula collected from mountains and plains of northern and north-central India was carried out with the help of the indicator kriging method. The total metal concentration varies between 25.4-429 mu gg(-1) and 22.8-507 mu gg(-1) dry weight in plains and mountains, respectively. The 'Indicator Kriging', a cokriging non-parametric approach has been applied to predict the total metal load (TML) probability from a regional lichen database derived from the different metals in the mountain and plain regions. Cr, Cd, Cu and Pb had higher concentrations having higher coverage area, while metals like Cd and Hg had the highest localized distribution indicating point sources. The probability values of TML are further related with topography, population density and land cover attributes to specific factors responsible for metal accumulation in the study area. Observations indicated that apart from local sources, topography, population density and land cover, also plays an essential role in the spatial behaviour of the metals, which has been verified by the bioaccumulation pattern of metals in lichen samples from the mountainous region. Among which three mountainous states of Northern India, Uttarakhand has a higher concentration of metals which may be attributed to the topography and local anthropogenic sources.

AB  - The heterogeneity of clinical responses to antifungals in aspergillosis is partially understood. We hypothesized that besides direct antifungal effects, these discrepancies may be related to different immunomodulatory profiles. Human THP-1 monocytes were coincubated in vitro with Aspergillus fumigatus and variable concentrations of voriconazole (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/l), caspofungin (1 and 2 mg/l), amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/l) and liposomal amphotericin B (1, 2 and 3 mg/l). After 6 h of coincubation, total cellular RNA was extracted, converted into cDNA, and transcription of 84 genes involved in antifungal immunity was measured through RT-qPCR. The presence of A. fumigatus was the main driver of the global immune-related transcriptomic response. After Aspergillus infection, thirty genes were upregulated, while 19 genes were downregulated. Discrepancies across antifungals were also evident; voriconazole-containing conditions showed similar reaction to natural infection, while the use of liposomal Amphotericin B significantly decreased the inflammatory response. Chemokines (notably CCL20 and CXCL2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A, IL1B, IL23, G-CSF) exhibited the most pronounced differences across antifungals. Pattern recognition receptors and adaptor protein transcription were minimally affected. Protein-protein-interaction network analysis showed that IL23A played a dominant role in upregulated genes. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that cytokine-cytokine receptor integration, TNF signaling pathways and Toll-like receptor pathways were highly involved. This exploratory study confirms the heterogeneous immunomodulatory role of antifungals. Overall, voriconazole appears to maintain an early pro-inflammatory response seen in natural infection. Assessment of immunomodulatory response with clinical response may provide a better rationale for differences observed across antifungals.

AB  - Surface velocity is traditionally measured with in situ techniques such as velocity probes (in shallow rivers) or Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (in deeper water). In the last years, researchers have developed remote sensing techniques, both optical (e.g., image-based velocimetry techniques) and microwave (e.g., Doppler radar). These techniques can be deployed from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), which ensure fast and low-cost surveys also in remotely-accessible locations. We compare the results obtained with a UAS-borne Doppler radar and UAS-borne Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in different rivers, which presented different hydraulic-morphological conditions (width, slope, surface roughness and sediment material). The Doppler radar was a commercial 24 GHz instrument, developed for static deployment, adapted for UAS integration. PIV was applied with natural seeding (e.g., foam, debris) when possible, or with artificial seeding (woodchips) in the stream where the density of natural particles was insufficient. PIV reconstructed the velocity profile with high accuracy typically in the order of a few cm s(-1) and a coefficient of determination (R-2) typically larger than 0.7 (in half of the cases larger than 0.85), when compared with acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) or velocity probe, in all investigated rivers. However, UAS-borne Doppler radar measurements show low reliability because of UAS vibrations, large instrument sampling footprint, large required sampling time and difficult-to-interpret quality indicators suggesting that additional research is needed to measure surface velocity from UAS-borne Doppler radar.

AB  - Purpose This study focuses on the application of reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) to a textile industry steam boiler. The study aims to demonstrate the development and application of RCM to a steam boiler used in the textile industry. Design/methodology/approach RCM is a structured process that develops maintenance activities needed on physical resources in their operational environment to realize their inherent reliability by logically incorporating an appropriate mixture of reactive, preventive, condition-based and proactive maintenance methods. A detailed analysis of the RCM approach is presented to develop preventive maintenance (PM) program and improve the reliability and availability of the steam boiler system. Findings The research reveals that the identification of PM tasks is a good indicator of the PM program's efficiency and can serve as an important maintenance-related downtime source. It is also discovered that the majority of maintenance programs that claim to be proactive are, in fact, reactive. This article also shows how RCM may be successfully implemented to any system, resulting in increased system reliability. Research limitations/implications The paper focuses on a pilot study of the development and implementation of the RCM technique to a textile industry steam boiler. It is suggested that the developed RCM model can be applied to the entire plant. Originality/value The paper presents a comprehensive RCM model framework as well as an RCM decision framework, providing maintenance managers and engineers with a step-by-step approach to RCM implementation. The proposed framework is significant in that it may be utilized for both qualitative and quantitative analysis at the same time.

AB  - Reduced welfare and productivity of dairy goats have often been associated with poor claw health, especially conditions such as claw overgrowth and deformations. It is known that periodic claw trimmings have prophylactic and therapeutic effects on these problems, and this study aimed to evaluate if the additional use of an angle grinder to finish trimming overgrown and deformed goat claws, after the usual trimming using hoof shears, could provide further changes in these claws. For this, twelve Saanen goats (57.29 +/- 11.15 kg of body weight, 3.08 +/- 1.78 years old) were selected by presence of severe claw overgrowth, and absence of claw alterations of other nature. Their claws were trimmed in two steps, first using hoof shears and then using an angle grinder. Morphometric, baropodometric, and conformational aspects of all claws were assessed before claw trimming and after each trimming step. To analyse the effects of the trimming steps in each claw, the Tukey's test was used on parametric data, with 5% probability, and descriptive statistics were used on non-parametric data. Although this is a small pilot study, results suggest that using an angle grinder after the use of hoof shears, could further reduce heel length and sole width of claws, as well as reduce the number of deformed claws. The incorporation of the second trimming tool, could also further increase the frequency with which the point of maximum pressure was found in the toes, rather then in the heels of the claws as seen in deformed claws.

AB  - Dysregulation of immunological and inflammatory processes is frequently observed in psychotic disorders. Numerous studies have examined the complex components of innate and adaptive immune processes in schizophrenia and related psychoses. Elevated inflammation in these conditions is related to neurobiological phenotypes and associated with both genetics and environmental exposures. Recent studies have utilized multivariate cytokine approaches to identify what appears to be a subset of individuals with elevated inflammation. The degree to which these findings represent a general process of dysregulated inflammation or whether there are more refined subtypes remains unclear. Brain-imaging studies have attempted to establish the link between peripheral inflammation and gray matter disruption, white matter abnormalities, and neuropsychological phenotypes. However, the interplay between peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation, as well as the consequences of this interplay, in the context of psychosis remains unclear and requires further investigation. This Perspectives article reviews the following elements of immune dysregulation and its clinical and therapeutic implications: (1) evidence supporting inflammation and immune dysregulation in schizophrenia and related psychoses; (2) recent advances in approaches to characterizing subgroups of patients with elevated inflammation; (3) relationships between peripheral inflammation and brain-imaging indicators of neuroinflammation; (4) convergence of large-scale genetic findings and peripheral inflammation findings; and (5) therapeutic implications: anti-inflammation interventions leveraging genetic findings for drug discovery and repurposing. We offer perspectives and examples of how multiomics technologies may be useful for constructing and studying immunogenetic signatures. Advancing research in this area will facilitate biomarker discovery, disease subtyping, and the development of etiological treatments for immune dysregulation in psychosis.

AB  - To assess the performance indicators for pharmaceutical services (PS) in primary health care (PHC), the level of satisfaction with pharmacy services among users and managers / pharmacists' impressions in relation to the findings were evaluated. The study used mixed methods, including a retrospective and descriptive study of the performance indicators for PS in PHC, an observational study on the level of satisfaction and a qualitative study of users' perception of pharmacy services at Health Units. Managers and pharmacists' impressions of the study results were also collected. Only 44.4% of pharmacies had a full-time pharmacist. From the establishments visited, 5.3% did not have an air-conditioned environment, and only 33.3% of the items essential to the Good Practices of Storage of Medicines and Supplies criteria were fulfilled. Although 77.9% of the prescribed medicines were dispensed, it did not reach the 80% standard. The satisfaction level of users was 3.2 +/- 0.6, indicating dissatisfaction with pharmacies' services. By means of an evaluation of each item within the questionnaire, it was possible to observe that variables related to pharmaceutical care presented low scores in relation to other domains, thus evidencing the fragility of the pharmaceutical-patient relationship in users' perception. Managers and pharmacists suggested that these results were related to the inadequate physical infrastructure of pharmacies, work overload, lack of recognition and undervaluation of pharmacists, lack of interaction within the PHC team, high turnover of pharmacists, and lack of PS prioritization by the administration. PS in PHC has structural and organizational weaknesses that require changes. In general, users are dissatisfied with pharmacies' services, especially with pharmaceutical care.

AB  - Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a statistically rigorous approach to assess the plausibility of competing models. It naturally accounts for uncertainties in models and data. In this study, we discuss the role of measurement noise in BMS deeper than in past literature. We distinguish between four cases, accounting for noise in models and/or data: (1) no-no, (2) no-yes, (3) yes-no, and (4) yes-yes. These cases differ mathematically and philosophically. Only two out of these four cases are logically consistent, and they represent two potentially conflicting research questions: "Which model is best in modeling the pure physics?" (Case 1) and "which model is best in predicting the data-generating process (i.e., physics plus noise)?" (Case 4). If we are interested in the "pure physics question," we face two practical challenges: First, we would need noise-free data, which is impossible to obtain; and second, the numerical approximation of Bayesian model evidence can be hard when neglecting noise. We discuss how to address both challenges and reveal that a fallback to the easier "data-generation question" as a proxy for the "physics question" is not appropriate. We demonstrate on synthetic scenarios and a real-world hydrogeological case study that the choice of the case has a significant impact on the outcome of posterior model weights, and hence on results of the model ranking, model selection, model averaging, model confusion analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Reality might force us to use a different case than philosophy would suggest, and we provide guidance on how to interpret model probabilities under such conditions.

AB  - Crinoids are largely considered as good indicators for determining environmental conditions. They are robust proxies for inferring changes in salinity and sedimentation rate and for inferring substrate type. Some crinoid groups (e.g., certain comatulids, cyrtocrinids, millericrinids) have a depth preference, thus, making them useful for palaeodepth estimation. The hypotheses that crinoid distribution is substrate dependent (rock type) or palaeodepth-dependent is tested here based on (a) archival Bathonian-Callovian (Middle Jurassic) crinoid occurrences from Poland and (b) newer finds from five boreholes from eastern Poland. Qualitative data suggests that isocrinids and cyclocrinids occur in both carbonate and siliciclastic rocks. The cyrtocrinids and roveacrinids occur within carbonate rocks, whereas the comatulids are exclusive to siliciclastics. In terms of palaeodepth, most crinoid groups dominate in shallow environments with the sole exception of cyrtocrinids, that are ubiquitous and occur in both shallow (near shore and shallow marine) and slightly deeper (deeper sublittoral to open shelf) settings. The occurrences of the cosmopolitan taxa, Chariocrinus andreae and Balanocrinus subteres (isocrinids), is independent of both substrate type and palaeodepth. Quantitative analyses (Analysis Of Variance; ANOVA) based on substrate type, i.e., substrate-dependency (claystones, sandstones and limestones), and palaeodepth i.e., palaeodepth-dependency (near shore, shallow-marine, mid ramp and offshore), corroborate qualitative results. Statistical analysis suggest that the distribution of crinoids shows a strong substrate-dependency but not for palaeodepth, although very weak significance (low p value) is noted for near shore and shallow marine settings and crinoid distribution.

AB  - Fish populations and communities are monitored using a variety of sampling gears, each with their own inherent biases. Gear biases can arise from a number of factors, such as fish species characteristics (e.g., body shape/size, physiology, and behaviour), species habitat requirements, as well as the abiotic characteristics of sites sampled. Such factors and their effects on gear selectivity are also heavily influenced by seasonality. Consequently, understanding the effects of seasonal changes on gear selectivity is of vital importance, especially during the winter-a season seldom studied in freshwater systems. Here, we compared the selectivity, efficiency, and degree of biodiversity in fish communities sampled using three gear types: minnow traps, Windermere traps, and electrofishing during summer and winter in Hamilton Harbour, ON, Canada. Catch per unit effort was similar among gear types in the summer, whereas in the winter, minnow traps captured the most fish. Electrofishing samples were the most species rich and species diverse, but only during the summer. Additionally, sampling efficiency and the number of different species encountered was highest when all gear types were used in combination, followed by electrofishing alone, Windermere traps alone, and minnow traps alone in both seasons. Each gear type differed in its selectivity for certain species, which was further influenced by seasonality. This resulted in the fish communities caught within each gear type being dissimilar from one another. Our study highlights the importance of understanding gear type selectivity, particularly under different climatic conditions, and outlines the importance of incorporating multiple gear types in ecological assessments of fish populations and communities.

AB  - A radiative cooler is an optical device which can spontaneously preserve its temperature below ambient by simultaneously reflecting solar radiation and emitting thermal radiation through the atmospheric window lying within 8-13 mu m of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the radiative cooling process, the universe acts as the ultimate heat sink for heat dissipation. Cooling power is a key indicator of the radiative cooling performance, which can reach a typical value of 100 W/m(2) under a clear sky. However, atmospheric transparency, which is usually hard to determine, affects the cooling power heavily. To fairly evaluate the cooling power under prescribed and controlled environmental conditions, we built an in-lab testing facility based on a hybrid refrigerative thermoelectric cooling system, which can artificially simulate the equivalent radiative cooling effect. We characterized the system performance and preserved the temperatures of the equivalent thermal reservoir at -19.9 degrees C and -12.7 degrees C steadily at ambient temperatures of 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C respectively. Under a reference atmospheric transmission spectrum featuring a high 8-13 mu m transparency, we measure the cooling powers of a representative radiative cooler and compare them with the theoretical values for ambient temperatures between 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Measured cooling powers range from 108 W/m(2) to 141 W/m(2), which exceed the theoretical values by 17 - 33% due to excessive heat flow through the testing cavity and heat lost to the surroundings. The method can be extended to examine thermal and energy associated performances of derivative radiative cooling devices and systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. Regions of Ukraine are characterized by a considerable level of disparities in socio-economic development. Interpretation of disparities is important in order to develop the measures preventing their aggravation.
   Problem Statement. The indices of regional disparities are variable and heterogeneous, with different dynamics. Thus, it is difficult to estimate them with the help of conventional methods that do not allow application of intermediate indices.
   Purpose. To formulate a mechanism for regulating regional disparities necessary for further solution of management and prognostic tasks based on innovative approaches given environmental variability, rapid, and nonlinear dynamics of disparities.
   Materials and Methods. For estimation and interpretation of indices for regional disparities, it is advisable to use methods of fuzzy logic theory. These methods apply to quantitative estimation of qualitative information (in the case when it is indefinite), modeling of increasingly complicated economic processes given a high reliability of calculations based on fuzzy logic models.
   Results. The mechanism for forecasting the dynamics of regional disparities by fuzzy logic methods has been presented as integration of interdependent factors ensuring development of the region under unstable conditions of external and internal environment. With the help of fuzzy logic methods, the membership function between the levels of disparities and the catalysts of disparities (retarders) has been built. The characteristics of regional disparity levels have been classified as permissible, regulated, and catastrophic. The study of dynamics of the disparity underlies elaborating public policy recommendations on the regulation of disparities.
   Conclusions. The characteristics of disparities for each region estimated on the basis of membership function pave the way for further forecasting the dynamics of disparities and developing a strategy for the regulation of disparities in each region.

AB  - A study of a section exposed in a quarry near the village of Loukhi revealed a radial kame ridge composed of horizontally layered lacustrine sands with cross-bedded sand lenses and interlayers of siltstone with a 0.2- to 1.2-m-thick horizon of convolutions occurring as wide synclines, narrow anticlines, and pseudonodules. The lacustrine sediments overlain by sand and gravel sediments with paleosols down the slope of the ridge give way to moraine boulder sands overlying the heavily dislocated strata. The objective of this work is to analyze the conditions for the formation of the kame and the deformation structures in its section as possible indicators of paleoseismicity. To account for the structural features of the section, it is proposed that the ridge formed as a result of the projection of sediments of a flowing subglacial lake, which emerged in the body of the glacier during the deglaciation period, onto the moraine. A structural analysis of reverse faults in the dislocated sediments proved their gravitational nature, which is not evident from glaciotectonics, indicating the immobility of the ice mass during ridge formation. Convolutions are developed in layers of a narrow granulometric range (fine-grained sands and silts), which is significantly different from seismites in subaqueous sediments of highly seismic regions. Therefore, these structures are not associated with seismic liquefaction, although the section is 40 km from the southwestern side of the Kandalaksha graben, where Holocene 8.0-point paleoearthquakes with moderate magnitudes were revealed. Thus, the study did not confirm the occurrence of paleoearthquakes with M >= 6-6.5 in the study area during the Late Ice Age.

TI  - Infrared Excitation Induces Heating and Calcium Microdomain Hyperactivity in Cortical Astrocytes
T2  - BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Unraveling how neural networks process and represent sensory information and how these cellular signals instruct behavioral output is a main goal in neuroscience. Two-photon activation of optogenetic actuators and calcium (Ca2+) imaging with genetically encoded indicators allow, respectively, the all-optical stimulation and readout of activity from genetically identified cell populations. However, these techniques locally expose the brain to high near-infrared light doses, raising the concern of light-induced adverse effects on the biology under study. Combining 2P imaging of Ca2+ transients in GCaMP6f-expressing cortical astrocytes and unbiased machine-based event detection, we demonstrate the subtle build-up of aberrant microdomain Ca2+ transients in the fine astroglial processes that depended on the average rather than peak laser power. Illumination conditions routinely being used in biological 2P microscopy (920-nm excitation, similar to 100-fs, and similar to 10 mW average power) increased the frequency of microdomain Ca2+ events but left their amplitude, area, and duration largely unchanged. Ca2+ transients in the otherwise silent soma were secondary to this peripheral hyperactivity that occurred without overt morphological damage. Continuous-wave (nonpulsed) 920-nm illumination at the same average power was as damaging as femtosecond pulses, unraveling the dominance of a heating-mediated damage mechanism. In an astrocyte-specific inositol 3-phosphate receptor type-2 knockout mouse, near-infrared light-induced Ca2+ microdomains persisted in the small processes, underpinning their resemblance to physiological inositol 3-phosphate receptor type-2-independent Ca2+ signals, whereas somatic hyperactivity was abolished. We conclude that, contrary to what has generally been believed in the field, shorter pulses and lower average power can help to alleviate damage and allow for longer recording windows at 920 nm.

AB  - The soil environment is being continually contaminated with heavy metals from emissions that are introduced from both the atmosphere and water under the condition of rapid urbanization and industrialization, which cause land use regression (LUR) models could not easily capture complex relationship between soil heavy metal and potential indicator. Random forest is a non-parametric statistical method that can manage non-linear relationships. This study aims to explore the application of random forest (RF) models in predicting the soil concentration and spatial distribution of six heavy metal(loid)s (Pb, Cd, Cr, As, Hg and Zn) comparing with land use regression (LUR) models. Finally, R-2 values for the RF models were approximately 0.90 and presented a larger cross-validation R-2 and lower root mean square error (RMSE) than LUR models. The comparison between the RF and LUR models demonstrates that the RF model performed better and RF can accurately predict the concentration and spatial distribution of heavy metal(loid)s in soils. Moreover, in the study area, human activities and transportation are the main sources of soil heavy metals Pb, sewage irrigation is the main source of Cd, Cr and Zn, and atmospheric deposition from thermal power stations is an important source of soil heavy metals Hg. Parent materials is the most likely source of As. Given the above, application of random forest in soil heavy metal(loid)s may assist soil environmental management departments to focus on controlling the diffusion of heavy metal(loid)s pollution sources in a practical way, and providing targets for pollution control and prevention.

AB  - Gate diffusion input (GDI) method using a simple cell makes it possible to design low-power logic gates with reduced chip area and less complexity. In this work, a novel design of single-bit optimized reversible logic-based magnitude arithmetic unit (RMAU) circuit, using appropriate standard reversible gates with carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistors (CNTFETs), based on modified-GDI (m-GDI) method for nanoscales is presented. In order to optimize the performance of the proposed circuit, and to achieve minimum power consumption and propagation delay, transistor sizes are adjusted using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) in MATLAB tool. The simulation results show improvement in evaluating the figure of merits in worst-case delay and power consumption of the proposed optimized arithmetic unit, in comparison with a non-optimized RMAU circuit using a similar design method but counterpart structures. The effects of different process parameters (such as the diameter of CNTs) and voltage and temperature (PVT) variations are extensively evaluated by theMonte Carloprocedure in standard 32 nm technology utilizing theSynopsysHSPICE simulator. According to the outcomes obtained, the proposed optimized RMAU circuit is robust against PVT variations and noise-tolerable criterions, compared to those competitors with similar design in non-optimized conditions. The proposed optimized and non-optimized circuits were used in image processing as real environment assessments, and results depicted their excellent ability in being implemented in various large reversible-based applications, such as future generations of FPGA chips and CNTFET-based computers.

AB  - Background: To evaluate the extent of recall of consent information by daycare prostate biopsy patients in our low-literacy setting. And to evaluate the role of a 3rd party check on patient's recall of consent information. Subjects and Methods: As part of our standard of care, a formal informed consent session for day care prostate biopsy takes place 3 days prior to the procedure. For this study, before leaving the outpatient clinic the same day, the patient acknowledged before a third-party that his concerns were or were not satisfactorily addressed. The extent of recall of consent information was assessed on the morning of the procedure using a researcher-administered questionnaire. Consecutive patients participated in this cross-sectional study for day care prostate biopsy at a tertiary hospital in southeast Nigeria from February to November 2015 after obtaining due consent. Results: The recall of the risks associated with the planned procedure was poorer than the recall of the nature of the disease condition or the nature of the planned procedure. However, it was observed that aggregate recall was significantly poorer among patients who negatively attested to a satisfying consent session (OR 0.125; P < 0.0005). Conclusion: The use of a third-party in determining patient satisfaction after a consent session may be a better indicator of patient comprehension and subsequent recall of consent information, especially in low-literacy settings. Using a third-party, in this manner, may assist in checking paternalism inherent in the patient-doctor relationship.

AB  - Coal mine accidents pose a serious threat to miners and the surrounding environment. Despite a recent downward trend in the numbers of major accidents and casualties in Chinese coal mining enterprises, accident reoccurrence remains an on-going issue for the industry. This paper aims to identify the root causes, namely, the characteristics of safety culture deficiencies driving typical coal accidents. Using the accident analysis pathway of the 24Model and the logical thought of Why Because Analysis (WBA), 67 typical major accidents (gas explosion, gas outburst, flooding and fire) are analysed to identify the deficiencies in safety culture based on the determinations of the safety culture dimension and statistics of recurrent accident patterns. The related elements and occurrence frequencies of the deficiencies in safety culture can be inferred as follows: ignored safety laws and regulations (frequency is 100 %), unrealized safety priority (100 %), limited role of functional departments (86.6 %), and insufficient attention to safety education for special operation personnel and mining workers (80.6 %), among others. These characteristics are not concerned with accident types, and the most prominent characteristics are manifested in four aspects: unrealized safety priority, flaws in management actions towards safety, passive safety compliance and participation of employees, and imperfect work conditions. Specifically, we emphasize the role of departments, safety communication, safety participation and supervision climate in influencing and improving the safety culture to further reduce industrial accidents.

AB  - Cr(VI) has posed a serious risk for the environment and human beings because of its pollution and toxicity. It is essential to understand the equilibrium behavior of Cr(VI) in soils. In this study, the adsorption of Cr(VI) on fourteen soils was studied with batch experiments and quantitative modeling. The batch experiments included the adsorption edge and adsorption isotherm experiments, investigating the adsorption of Cr(VI) with varying soil properties, solution pH, and initial Cr(VI) concentrations. The experimental data were then modeled using the surface complexation models in Visual MINTEQ of CD-MUSIC by considering the adsorption of Cr(VI) and ions onto Fe (hydr)oxides and Al (hydr)oxides, and the Stockholm Humic Model and the fixed charge site model by accounting for the adsorption of the cations to soil organic matter and clay, respectively. Particularly, the modeling method of this study introduced an important parameter RO- to account for the amount of soil organic matter irreversibly adsorbed on soil minerals. Overall, the model predicted reasonably well for the equilibrium partition of Cr(VI) under various conditions with a root-mean-square-error of 0.35 for the adsorption edge data and 0.19 for the adsorption isotherm data. According to the model calculations, ferrihydrite dominated the binding of Cr(VI) at pH of 3.0-7.0. The content of ferrihydrite and reactive soil organic matter was found to be the main factor influencing RO-. The modeling results help to understand and predict Cr(VI) adsorption on different soils and are beneficial to environmental risk assessment and pollution remediation.

AB  - Compared with non-limestone forests, limestone forests tend to show lower pteridophyte diversity, yet they are known to harbor a unique set of species due to their substrate conditions and naturally fragmented habitat areas. Pteridophyte assemblage composition, however, has not been quantitatively investigated in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China, known as one of the most species-rich areas of China. Using a fully standardized sampling protocol, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) pteridophyte species composition is different between limestone forests (LF) and non-limestone forests (NLF); and the differences are attributable to (2) lower species richness in LF; (3) greater spatial and temporal turnovers (beta diversity) in LF; and (4) higher proportion of pteridophyte species restricted to LF. We found significant differences in pteridophyte assemblage compositions between LF and NLF. Average species richness per transect (alpha diversity) was lower in LF than in NLF, but we found no difference in overall species richness (gamma diversity) between LF and NLF at the scale of this study, because species turnover among samples (beta diversity) was higher in LF than in NLF. A total of 23 species were restricted to LF and 32 species restricted to NLF; however, geographic distribution of LF species was limited to certain habitat patches within this habitat. Our results suggest that LF pteridophyte biodiversity cannot be protected by conserving a limited number of habitat patches, because loss of one LF habitat patch may result in local extinction of species or extinction of endemic species that are yet to be discovered.

AB  - The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a popular technology used in waste heat recovery and medium-low-temperature heat utilization. Working fluid plays a very important role in ORC. The selection of working fluid can greatly affect the efficiency, the operation condition, the impact on the environment, and the economic feasibility of ORC. The expander is a key device in ORC. As a novel expander, single-screw expanders have been becoming a research focus in the above two areas because of their many good characteristics. One of the advantages of single-screw configurations is that they can conduct a vapor-liquid two-phase expansion. Therefore, in order to give full play to this advantage, a working fluid selection for ORC using a single-screw expander was conducted in this paper. Three indicators, namely, net work output, thermal efficiency, and heat exchange load of condenser, were used to analyze the performance of an ORC system. Through calculation and analysis, it can be seen that an ORC system that uses a single-screw expander and undergoes a vapor-liquid two-phase expansion is able to obtain a higher thermal efficiency, higher net work output, and a smaller heat exchange load of the condenser. Regardless of whether isentropic efficiency of the expander is considered or not, cis-butene may be the best candidate for working in subcritical cycles. HFO working fluids are more suitable for working in transcritical cycles, and HFO-1234ze(E) may be the best.

AB  - The aim of this study was to document species composition and richness as well as light affinity of the herbaceous understorey in an oak-hornbeam coppice-with-standards forest with respect to phytosociology. Our research questions were (i) how does the herbaceous understorey react to interventions of different size, (ii) how do their light indicators values (Ellenberg et al. 2001) reflect silvicultural methods, and (iii) do local temperatures mirror the respective light environment? In an oak-hornbeam coppice-with-standards forest in North-eastern Lower Austria with the most recent coppice harvesting in 1958, the effects of two silvicultural methods on the herbaceous layer were investigated. The treatments were (i) a coppice with standards treatment for 20 years, and ii) small gap clearings for 7 years. Species richness and composition as well as indicator values were compared to the surrounding forest, since the small gap-clearings were also coppiced in 2009. Phytosociological releves and the calculation of light indicator values indicated that small gap clearings appear to be more effective in re-establishing an understorey community close to the typical forest community than coppicing. One reason is that small gaps provide light conditions for the understorey vegetation similar to the forest. More light-affine species cannot easily penetrate into these gaps from outside the forest. Very dense Carpinion stands shifting towards other Fagetalia communities should be coppiced more often, but on a small scale to promote herbaceous Carpinion species in the understorey. Thus forest management can help preserve these site-specific typical vegetation communities.

AB  - The opportunity to co-locate wind and wave energy exploitation is analyzed in the Italian seas grounding on the rationale that benefits are greater when un-correlated resources are combined. The study shows that, although waves and winds are generally strongly correlated, in some conditions their correlation is lower and the combined energy harvesting more interesting. As spatial conflicts of sea use and demand for maritime space are increasing, the development of the marine renewable energy sector needs to be evaluated in the perspective of the cumulative pressures deriving from present activities or expected from future developments. The evaluation of areas of potential conflicts among human activities, environmental vulnerabilities and marine renewable developments may facilitate the early development of mitigation actions and negotiations between stakeholders. In this study the opportunity of co-locating offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters is analyzed through a spatial planning approach. Both the potential for combining different renewable technologies, and the impact associated to such development was considered in the context of the existing pressures (e.g., naval traffic; mariculture activities; submarine cables routes; dredge spoils dumping; offshore activities; windfarms and ocean energy projects) and vulnerabilities (Marine Protected Areas, Key habitat presence) through quantitative indicators. The portion of Tyrrhenian coast south of Elba island, the northern-western Sardinian coast, and the southern Adriatic and Ionian coastal waters appear to be the most suitable sites. Moreover, the study presents a spatial quantitative methodology to identify sites of potential interest for the development of the marine renewable energy sector in the perspective of cost-effectiveness and environmental impact minimization.

AB  - A comprehensive literature review was conducted on the concept of job satisfaction in the pharmacist workforce field and the facets it comprises, as well as its measurement, aiming to (i) review the nature, mechanisms, and importance of job satisfaction in the context of the pharmacist workforce, (ii) survey some of the most salient facets that configure job satisfaction, and (iii) discuss validity and measurement issues pertaining to it.
   Although female pharmacists generally hold less appealing jobs, earn lower wages and salaries, and are promoted less frequently than their male counterparts, they report higher levels of job satisfaction. Age has a U-shape effect on job satisfaction, with middle-age pharmacists less satisfied than both younger and older practitioners. Workload, stress, advancement opportunities, job security, autonomy, fairness in the workplace, supervisors, coworkers, flexibility, and job atmosphere are facets contributing to pharmacists' job satisfaction. Finally, discrepancy exists among researchers in measuring job satisfaction as a single global indicator or as a composite measure derived from indices of satisfaction with key aspects of a job.
   Understanding the mechanisms that affect pharmacists' job satisfaction is important to employers in their pursuit to respond to practitioners' needs, decrease turnover, and increase productivity. As pharmacists' response to work-related conditions and experiences depends on gender and age, a unique set of rewards and incentives may not be universally effective. Additional research into the dynamics of the forces shaping pharmacists' perceptions, opinions, and attitudes is needed in order to design and implement policies that allocate human resources more efficiently within the various pharmacy settings.

AB  - Marine biologists have progressively increased their consciousness of the importance of meiofauna for the benthic domain in both temperate and tropical regions. After the 1998 bleaching, Maldivian reefs (Indian Ocean) have been regarded as a vulnerable ecosystem that must be carefully monitored. Accordingly, an extensive investigation of meiofaunal distribution in the reef slopes of the Maldivian archipelago has been carried out, taking into account geographical position, type of habitat (inner vs. outer slope), inclination and depth gradient. Twenty-four taxa revealed the highest meiofaunal richness ever found in Maldivian reefs. Interestingly, Thermosbenacea and Syncarida were identified, which are two taxa that have only recently been documented in the marine ecosystem. Chaetognatha were also present, which is a group that was only considered to be planktonic until 2000, when they were also discovered in the benthos. The type of habitat, affected by different hydrodynamic conditions, was the main factor influencing the meiofaunal community's structure and diversity. In detail, the outer reefs were characterized by the highest level of diversity, confirming previous observations on the rate of coral reef growth and vitality and underlining the greater vulnerability of the inner slopes. In contrast, depth only significantly affected the community structure, but not its density or diversity. Accordingly, community structure seems to be more sensitive than abundance and diversity indices when it comes to detecting depth gradients. The 10 inclination of the inner slopes revealed the most different community structure and the greatest dominance of nematodes, leading to the lowest diversity levels.

AB  - Increasing numbers of ecosystems globally are at risk of collapse. However, most descriptions of terrestrial ecosystem collapse are post hoc with few empirically based examples of ecosystems in the process of collapse. This limits learning about collapse and impedes development of effective early-warning indicators. Based on multidecadal and multifaceted monitoring, we present evidence that the Australian mainland Mountain Ash ecosystem is collapsing. Collapse is indicated by marked changes in ecosystem condition, particularly the rapid decline in populations of keystone ecosystem structures. There also has been significant decline in biodiversity strongly associated with these structures and disruptions of key ecosystem processes. In documenting the decline of the Mountain Ash ecosystem, we uncovered evidence of hidden collapse. This is where an ecosystem superficially appears to be relatively intact, but a prolonged period of decline coupled with long lag times for recovery of dominant ecosystem components mean that collapse is almost inevitable. In ecosystems susceptible to hidden collapse, management interventions will be required decades earlier than currently perceived by policy makers. Responding to hidden collapse is further complicated by our finding that different drivers produce different pathways to collapse, but these drivers can interact in ways that exacerbate and perpetuate collapse. Management must focus not only on reducing the number of critical stressors influencing an ecosystem but also on breaking feedbacks between stressors. We demonstrate the importance of multidecadal monitoring programs in measuring state variables that can inform quantitative predictions of collapse as well as help identify management responses that can avert system-wide collapse.

AB  - Hydrological heritage is a relatively new concept in the field of geosite assessment. The principal aim of this study is to apply M-GAM (Modified geosite assessment model) for comparative analysis of the Krupaja spring and the Zagubica (Mlava) spring, located in Homolje area, in Eastern Serbia. According to the classification of geosites of Institute for Nature Conservation of Serbia, these sites are on the list of protected sites ("hydro(geo)logical" heritage sites) of extraordinary national importance; however, they still have not gained necessary recognition in Serbia. Thus, their assessment according to different target groups should provide a clearer picture of their current condition. As M-GAM considers that not all indicators for evaluation of geosites are of the same importance, this paper applies two methods for comparing and determining the importance of indicators and subindicators in the model (Analytical-hierarchy process (AHP) and descriptive statistics conducted by SPSS). Also, it is assumed that different target groups will give different importance to some indicators in the model, which would result in various evaluation scores for the same geosites. The paper also provides a comparative analysis of the assessment carried out by two different target groups - potential geotourists and geoexperts. The results obtained by AHP and descriptive statistics are quite similar, which confirms the reliability of respondents' answers and the results gained. The analyzed sites are differently positioned in the evaluation matrix, and implications are further discussed in the paper.

AB  - With increasing concerns in sustainable development, biocatalysis has been recognized as a competitive alternative to traditional chemical routes in the past decades. As nature's biocatalysts, enzymes are able to catalyze a broad range of chemical transformations, not only with mild reaction conditions but also with high activity and selectivity. However, the insufficient activity or enantioselectivity of natural enzymes toward non-natural substrates limits their industrial application, while directed evolution provides a potent solution to this problem, thanks to its independence on detailed knowledge about the relationship between sequence, structure, and mechanism/function of the enzymes. A proper high-throughput screening (HTS) method is the key to successful and efficient directed evolution. In recent years, huge varieties of HTS methods have been developed for rapid evaluation of mutant libraries, ranging from in vitro screening to in vivo selection, from indicator addition to multi-enzyme system construction, and from plate screening to computation- or machine-assisted screening. Recently, there is a tendency to integrate directed evolution with metabolic engineering in biosynthesis, using metabolites as HTS indicators, which implies that directed evolution has transformed from molecular engineering to process engineering. This paper aims to provide an overview of HTS methods categorized based on the reaction principles or types by summarizing related studies published in recent years including the work from our group, to discuss assay design strategies and typical examples of HTS methods, and to share our understanding on HTS method development for directed evolution of enzymes involved in specific catalytic reactions or metabolic pathways.

AB  - Currently there is a great deal of interest on health benefits of inorganic nanoparticles. Although they have been successfully introduced against several diseases, their direct use in treatment of chronic diseases are sparse in the literature. Chronic liver diseases are the fifth most common cause of death, affecting around 400 million people per year worldwide and have no effective medication. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential hepatoprotective activity of orally administered citrate functionalized Mn3O4 nanoparticles (C-Mn3O4 NPs) against CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity. Our results show that oral treatment of C-Mn3O4 NPs can effectively reduce severe chronic liver damage even fibrosis in CCl4-induced mice model. Further investigations revealed that C-Mn3O4 NPs show increased antioxidant activity upon acid treatment (both in vitro and in vivo i.e., stomach), which is in turn responsible for its hepatoprotective nature. Assessment of various liver function parameters along with histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate pathophysiological condition of the liver. To unravel the mechanisms involved in attenuation of liver injury by NPs, various antioxidant parameters (like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione etc.) were also examined. An in depth study of the effect of C-Mn3O4 NPs on mitochondria, the cellular mediator of oxidative stress further revealed the molecular mechanism behind its therapeutic efficacy. To best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates direct oral treatment of an inorganic NPs (i.e., C-Mn3O4 NPs) without any delivery system can efficiently reduce chronic hepatotoxicity and liver fibrosis through its antioxidant activity.

AB  - Metal tissue residue evaluation in benthic macroinvertebrates is an important component of an integrated approach to ecological risk assessment of metals and metalloids in the Nalon River basin (North Spain), where historic mining activities took place. The purpose of this study was to know the baseline tissue concentration of 7 metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and one metalloid (As) in aquatic oligochaetes, sediment burrower organisms, representative of the collector-gatherer functional feeding group in the macroinvertebrate community. Metal concentration was measured in sediment and field aquatic oligochaetes at several reference (minimally disturbed) sites of the Nalon River basin, selected following Water Framework Directive criteria. Metal tissue residues were measured separately in field microdriles and lumbricids and compared with tissue concentrations measured in the aquatic oligochaete Tubifex tubifex exposed to reference sediments from the Nalon and other Cantabrian River basins in 28-d chronic laboratory bioassays. Metal tissue residues in bioassay organisms attained usually higher levels than in field worms, in special for As, Cu, Hg and Zn, although metal levels were within the same order of magnitude. The baseline values for metals were calculated from 90th percentile (P90) values in field aquatic oligochaetes (microdriles and lumbricids). The P90 for Hg, As and Zn could efficiently discriminate Toxic and Non-Toxic sites, while baseline values calculated for the other metals deserve further research due either to the low range of values found in the present study, or to the regulation of the metal body concentration, as in the case of Cu.

AB  - The rapid implementation of anaerobic digestion for renewable energy production has resulted in increased generation of anaerobically digested slurry, which contains a variety of pollutants and therefore has the potential to cause serious environmental problems. Tidal flow constructed wetlands, which could generate beneficial oxygen conditions, were investigated for their success in removing nitrogen, organic matter and pathogens in anaerobically digested slurry. The results indicated that tidal operation had a positive effect on promoting NH4+-N and organic matter (chemical oxygen demand (COD)) removal. With an average influent NH4+-N concentration of 288 mg/L and COD concentration of 839 mg/L, the average removal efficiency reached up to 93% (325 g/m(2) day) for NH4+-N and 53% (603 g/m(2) day) for COD, with total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal efficiency of 51% (226 g/m(2) day). The nitrogen removal in the tidal-operated CWs is highly dependent on the flooded and drained (F/D) time ratio. Changing flooded time from 3 to 5 h enhanced denitrification (nitrite reductase-K (nirK) abundance) and further resulted in improved TIN removal efficiency of 62% (237 g/m(2) day). The removal of faecal indicators was also examined, with reduction rate of approximately 0.9 log(10) CFU/100 mL for both Escherichia coli and total coliforms, which was independent of the influent loadings and differing flooded/drained time ratio. Tidal flow CWs were demonstrated to have the high potential to treat diluted anaerobically digested slurry.

AB  - CO2 utilization is gaining attention as a greenhouse gas abatement strategy complementary to CO2 storage. This study explores the techno-environmental performance of CO2 utilization trough dry reforming of methane into syngas for the production of dimethyl ether (DME). The CO2 source is a hydrogen production unit at a refinery, where solvent based CO2 capture is applied. Aspen+ modelling and hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to assess the techno-environmental performance of this utilization option compared to a reference case without CO2 capture and a case with CO2 capture and storage. Results of the technical assessment show that although 94% of the captured CO2 can be utilised for DME production, only 9% of CO2 is avoided in the entire process as a result of direct CO2 formation during DME synthesis and the combustion of syngas to provide the heat demanded by the dry reforming process. Besides, a substantial amount, of electricity is required for syngas compression. Consequently, the LCA results indicate that climate change potential (CCP) is reduced by 8% while it is 37% higher than CCP when CO2 is stored and DME is produced conventionally. Sensitivity analyses are performed on various process conditions. Overall, this study indicates that this utilization route lowers the CCP although the reduction is limited compared to CCS. While the techno-environmental analysis is a useful tool to gain better insights in the performance of CO2 utilization options, the complex environmental trade-offs make it difficult to draw robust conclusions on the performance.

AB  - Increasing connectivity among habitat patches is assumed to mitigate the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, leading to the emergence of green and blue infrastructures in public policies as corridors facilitating movements of species within fragmented landscapes. But still, the scientific knowledge and tools for identifying critical features that make a corridor efficient for biodiversity conservation, and for guiding their establishment and management are still scarce. Here, we define three types of indicator species based on their ecological requirements and dispersal traits in the context of forest metacommunities embedded into agricultural landscapes in N France. We then evaluate whether hedgerows can act as corridors for forest herb species and if this can be predicted from the occurrence of the selected indicator species. We show that among each socio-ecological group of forest herb species, (i) the best disperser ("scout" species) indicates habitat suitability for the other species of the group, hence predicts a colonization credit; (ii) the species with intermediate dispersal traits ("median" species) indicates forest species richness and composition of a given hedgerow. In contrast, the worst dispersers ("focal" species) have a low indicator power, as a probable consequence of extinction events occurring in hedgerows, where ecological conditions are suboptimal with respect of forest species. The quality of the corridor increases with the width, height and age of hedgerows, but decreases with increasing land use intensity in adjacent lands. We conclude that process-based indicator species can be valuable tools to assess the efficiency of ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few studies have been conducted to examine the spatial heterogeneity of riverine sediment organic matter (SOM) at the molecular level. The present study explored the chemical and molecular heterogeneity of alkaline-extractable SOM from riverine sediments via multiple analytical tools including molecular composition, absorption and fluorescence spectra, and molecular size distributions. The riverine SOM revealed complex and diverse characteristics, exhibiting a great number of non-redundant formulas and high spatial variations. The molecular diversity was more pronounced for the sediments affected by a higher degree of anthropogenic activities. Unlike the cases of aquatic dissolved organic matter, highly-unsaturated structures with oxygen (HUSO) of SOM were more associated with the spectral and size features of humic-like (or terrestrial) substances than aromatic molecules were, cautioning the interpretation of the SOM molecules responsible for apparent indicators. Noting that a higher detection rate (DR) produces fewer common molecules, the common molecules of 23 different SOMs were determined at a reasonable DR value of 0.35, which accounted for a small portion (5.8%) of all detected molecules. They were mainly CHO compounds (>98%), which positively correlated with spectral indicators of biological production. Despite the low abundance, however, the ratios of aromatic to aliphatic substances could be indexed to classify the common molecules into several geochemical molecular groups with different degrees of the associations with the apparent spectral and size indicators.

AB  - Sunlight irradiation is known to contribute to microbial inactivation in natural treatment systems (NTS) and surface waters via both direct and indirect processes. This study investigated the influence of various types of organic matter (OM) on endogenous and exogenous photoinactivation of Enterococcus faecalis. Solar simulator exposure experiments were conducted in surface waters and wastewater and in the presence of natural OM isolates and a singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) sensitizer, methylene blue. Presence of both natural and anthropogenic OM resulted in increases in inactivation rates of 17-67% compared to sensitizer-free experiments. This suggests that, while direct and endogenous photoinactivation is hindered with increasing depth due to light screening by OM, its role as a photosensitizer in the formation of reactive intermediates (predominantly involving O-1(2)) is greater than its negative impact due to light screening at levels typically found in NTS. Specifically, increases in light absorbance (particularly at shorter wavelengths) are estimated to reduce direct and endogenous processes by up to 41% under our experimental conditions; however, presence of external photosensitizers enhances exogenous inactivation processes to a greater degree. A novel approach is presented to help estimate endogenous and exogenous inactivation rates of E. faecalis as a function of depth in the presence of OM based on common optical measurements. Implications of this knowledge in informing design parameters (e.g., depth and retention time) of NTS are discussed, thus contributing to both fundamental understanding of photoinactivation processes in surface waters and improvement of treatment unit design.

AB  - Safeguarding the diversity of natural and semi-natural habitats in Europe is one of the aims set out by the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora) and one of the targets of the European 2020 Biodiversity Strategy, and is to be accomplished by maintaining a favourable conservation status. To reach this aim a high-level understanding of the distribution and conditions of these habitats is needed. Remote sensing can considerably contribute to habitat mapping and their observation over time. Several European projects and a large number of scientific studies have addressed the issue of mapping and monitoring natural habitats via remote sensing and the deriving of indicators on their conservation status. The multitude of utilized remote sensing sensors and applied methods used in these studies, however, impede a common understanding of what is achievable with current state-of-the-art technologies. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis on what is currently feasible in terms of detection and monitoring of natural and semi-natural habitats with remote sensing. To focus this endeavour, we concentrate on those studies aimed at direct mapping of individual habitat types or discriminating between different types of habitats occurring in relatively large, spatially contiguous units. By this we uncover the potential of remote sensing to better understand the distribution of habitats and the assessment of their conservation status in Europe. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding sources of recharge and mechanisms for hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in the Shule River basin, an arid inland river basin in northwestern China, is essential for successful water resource management. Sources of water and associated groundwater recharge processes were investigated using hydrogeological, hydrogeochemical, and isotopic methods. The study area was divided into three parts: Changma, the Shule valley, and the Beishan area. The hydrogeochemical and isotopic analysis results show that groundwater in Changma mainly originated from precipitation in the Qilian Mountains. Lateral flow from Changma is the primary recharge mechanism, while direct recharge by infiltration of precipitation can be neglected in the Shule valley. Minerals within the aquifer material (e.g., halite, calcite, dolomite, and gypsum) dissolve into water that recharges the groundwater system. Therefore, strong linear relationships were found between Na+ and Cl- and between Ca2++Mg2+ and SO4 (2-)+HCO3 (-), with stoichiometry ratios of approximately 1:1 in both cases. Groundwater quality in the region is generally good, with low salinity and hardness. Local precipitation is the only source of recharge for groundwater in the Beishan area. Low groundwater velocity and dry climatic conditions suggest that dissolution of minerals from the aquifer material controls hydrogeochemical evolution. Water rarely travels from the Beishan area to the Shule valley; therefore, almost all the groundwater in the Shule valley originates from Changma. Global climate change and loss of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains may lead to a reduction of recharge; therefore, the groundwater resources of the Shule valley must be managed to sustain water supply.

AB  - The adequacy of meteorological drought intensity threshold levels based on deviations of monthly precipitation totals from normal climatological conditions is reconsidered. The motivation for this study is the observation that reference classification systems are fixed for all climatological regions, and threshold levels have been proposed without regard for the statistical distribution of accumulated precipitation in space and time. This misrepresentation of precipitation variability may lead to erroneous estimates of meteorological drought onset in specific areas where natural breaks in the cumulative distribution of monthly precipitation do not fit the generalized classification systems. In this study, a new optimized classification system based on the nonparametric "Fisher Jenks" algorithm is proposed for the estimation of meteorological drought intensity threshold levels from monthly precipitation totals. The optimized classification system is compared using the tabular accuracy index (TAI) to three fixed classification systems that are proposed in the literature and widely applied in the operational setting. An assessment of drought intensity classifications with optimized and fixed threshold levels shows that 1) six optimized categories most accurately divide precipitation totals into the most appropriate drought intensities, 2) optimized thresholds always give considerably improved drought intensity category allocations over fixed thresholds with the same number of categories, and 3) fixed thresholds underestimate the drought onset. An analysis of monthly and long-term drought frequency for Latin America has been conducted for assessing the spatial link between meteorological drought intensity categories computed with the Fisher-Jenks algorithm and different climate classifications. The results show a systematic match between climate variability in the region and spatial patterns of meteorological drought intensity.

AB  - Production, transport, and degradation of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) influence carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in both soils and downstream aquatic ecosystems. Here, we assessed the impacts of wildfire on DOM production, composition, and reactivity (biodegradation versus UV degradation) from soils of upland forest and peatland ecosystems. Soil C solubility was lowest for upland char samples, highest from surface soils in unburned spruce stands and decreased with a higher degree of peat humification regardless of fire history. Soil nitrogen (N) became relatively more soluble in both upland and peat soils post-fire, as leachate C/N decreased. Biodegradability was lower for DOM leachates from burned than unburned soils, both in upland and peatland sites. Several DOM composition indices were related to biodegradability; with the strongest relationship for specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (indicator of aromaticity). Parallel factor analysis revealed distinctive characteristics of leachates from burned soils and char that were related to low biodegradability and high UV-mediated losses. Relative to dark incubations, incubation under UV conditions led to greater C losses for highly aromatic leachates, but reduced losses for leachates with low aromaticity. This suggests that UV-mediated degradation could provide a pathway for highly stable terrestrial organic matter, including char, to become rapidly mineralized and released to the atmosphere once it reaches aquatic ecosystems in dissolved form. Together our results demonstrate that wildfire can potentially alter both turnover of DOM in terrestrial soils and linkages between terrestrial and aquatic C cycling through its influence on terrestrial DOM production and composition.

AB  - The authors propose that inclusion of medium- to high-frequency variability information will provide improved metrics of tropical cyclogenesis (TCG) applicable to climate GCM diagnostics. Capabilities of the Community Atmosphere Model version 3.1 (CAM3.1) GCM are assessed for detecting both large-scale and localized conditions for TCG in the tropical North Atlantic by comparison with the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and observed TCG occurrences. CAM3.1 seasonality of large-scale environmental factors conducive to TCG compares favorably with the ERA-40. It is determined that most of the TCG-related high-frequency temporal variability in the ERA-40 is explained by dynamic variability; each of the CAM3.1 ensemble members has lower variability in these dynamic fields. Seventeen environmental variables are evaluated as potential indicators of TCG activity based on daily anomalous variability with respect to a 15-day base period. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to synthesize these into a set of uncorrelated parameters. ERA-40 PCA composite variables are used to develop logistic and Poisson regression models for TCG detection and frequency in the North Atlantic main development region. Some skill metrics for the logistic model are promising, but the threat score and hit rate signify that further development of the logistic regression model is warranted; results from the Poisson regression model based on the same inputs are weaker, implying that weighting by TCG counts does not improve the results. These findings indicate merit in incorporating medium- to high-frequency variability in TCG metrics for diagnostics of seasonal activity and for application to climate models.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated atmospheric deposition as an important source of bioreactive compounds to the ocean. The South China Sea (SCS), where aerosol loading is among the highest in the world, however, is poorly studied, particularly on the in situ response of phytoplankton community structures to atmospheric deposition. By conducting a series of microcosm bioassays at different hydrographical locations and simulating different aerosol event scales, we observed both positive and negative responses to the input of East Asian (EA) aerosol with high nitrogen (N) and trace metal contents, in terms of biomass, composition and physiological characteristics of phytoplankton communities. High levels of aerosol loading relieved phytoplankton nitrogen and trace metal limitations in SCS, and thus increased total phytoplankton biomass, enhanced their physiological indicators (e.g. photosynthetic efficiency) and shifted phytoplankton assemblages from being dominated by picoplankton to microphytoplanton, especially diatoms. However, under low levels of aerosol loading, the composition shift and biomass accumulation were not apparent, suggesting that the stimulation effects might be counterbalanced by enhanced grazing mortality indicated by increased abundance of protist grazers. Trace metal toxicity of the aerosols might also be the reason for the reduction of picocyanobacteria when amended with high EA aerosols. The magnitude and duration of the deposition event, as well as the hydrographical and trophic conditions of receiving waters are also important factors when predicting the influence of an aerosol deposition event. Our results demonstrated different responses of phytoplankton and microbial food web dynamics to different scales of atmospheric input events in SCS and highlighted the need for achieving an accurate comprehension of atmospheric nutrient on the biogeochemical cycles of the oceans.

AB  - Freshwater polluted with herbicides is an environmental problem of concern due to the high toxicity and non-biodegradability of these compounds. This work analyses for the first time the degradation and mineralization of diuron (N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethyl-urea), considered priority substance by the European Commission, by electrochemical oxidation (EO) at a boron-doped diamond anode enhanced by low frequency (20 kHz) ultrasound (US). A synergistic analysis was initially performed to evaluate the relative contribution of individual oxidation technologies to the global abatement and mineralization rates of diuron observed under sonoelectrochemical (US-EO) treatment. Under the operation conditions, j = 60 mA cm(-2), v(US) = 20 kHz, pH = 12, T= 10 degrees C and 8 h of experimental running, results demonstrated improvements on the mineralization kinetics of diuron closely to 43% when ultrasounds are coupled to the electrochemical treatment. The process efficiency was evaluated through the analysis of the mineralization rate as a good indicator of the formation of organic metabolites which may have higher toxic effects than parent diuron. The mineralization kinetics of diuron degradation by US-EO have been experimentally and theoretically analysed working with 20-30 mgL(-1) of diuron, initial pH values between 2 and 12 and temperatures between 10 degrees C and 40 degrees C. The encouraging results showed that alkaline pH favours the mineralization rate obtaining reductions of the total organic carbon higher than the 92% after 6 h of degradation. The temperature in the range between 10 degrees C and 40 degrees C has a weak impact on the kinetics of the sonoelectrochemical mineralization of diuron. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the emphasis in climate change research, international negotiations, and developing-country activities has shifted from mitigation to adaptation, vulnerability has emerged as a bridge between impacts on one side and the need for adaptive changes on the other. Still, the term vulnerability remains, its meaning changing with the scale, focus, and purpose of each assessment. Understanding regional vulnerability has advanced over the past several decades, with studies using a combination of indicators, case studies and analogs, stakeholder-driven processes, and scenario-building methodologies. As regions become increasingly relevant scales of inquiry for bridging the aggregate and local, for every analysis, it is perhaps most appropriate to ask three 'what' questions: 'What/who is vulnerable?', 'What is vulnerability?', and 'Vulnerable to what?' The answers to these questions will yield different definitions of vulnerability as well as different methods for assessing it. Vulnerability research that is primarily quantitative has been dominated by the use of indicators. Regional vulnerability research can also focus on or include stakeholder involvement processes, especially helpful in generating agreement on issues and understanding context-specific aspects of vulnerability and prospective adaptations. Creating scenarios is another increasingly useful method that helps researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders think about the future and plan options for alternative futures. Current research efforts are emphasizing stakeholder involvement, with a dual focus on vulnerability assessment and social learning in the process; and scenario analyses, which may be expert-defined or stakeholder-driven. Both tend to span impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation decision making for a particular place and conditions. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. WIREs Clim Change 2011 2 462-474 DOI:10.1002/wcc.116

AB  - The objective of the present study is to analyze age-specific mortality in a rural indigenous community in the throes of a secular increase in size in the Valley of Oaxaca, southern Mexico, over 30 years, 1970-1999. Variation in mortality by age group was analyzed over time for evidence of an epidemiological transition. The seasonal rain pattern in the Valley of Oaxaca (83% from May through September) was evaluated for its relationship with mortality in wet and dry months. Mortality and causes of death changed markedly over the 30-year interval. Infant and preschool mortality, overall mortality, and causes of death changed from the 1970s through the 1990s. Prereproductive deaths (<15 years) predominated in the 1970s and were largely due to gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, with periodic out-breaks of measles. Deaths of adults 65+ years predominated in the 1990s and were largely due to degenerative diseases usually associated with aging. The marked changes in age and causes of death over the three decades (epiderniologic transition from Stage I to Stage 11) occurred concurrently with significant secular increases in body size in children, adolescents, and young adults, highlighting improved health and nutritional conditions in the community which is in early Stage II of the demographic transition. The demographic transition to Stage II is a leading indicator (15-25 years lag) for the onset of the secular trend, while the epiderniologic transition to Stage II is a predictor that the secular increase is in process in the study community.

AB  - Very few coral reefs are located close enough to large cities to study the influence of large urban populations on reef assemblages. An exception is the Thousand Islands reef complex to the north of Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, and one of the largest conurbations in the world. Here we present data from a detailed survey where sponge assemblages were assessed at 30 patch reefs associated with islands in three coastal zones along an in-to-offshore gradient. Sponge assemblages are described at three taxonomic levels of detail (species, genus and family level). We recorded a total of 118 sponge species, 64 genera and 36 families, Aaptos suberitoides (Bronsted, 1934), Clathria (Thalysias) reinwardti (Vosmaer, 1880), Petrosia (Petrosia) nigricans (Lindgren, 1897) and Xestospongia testudinaria (Lamarck, 1813) were the most common species overall. There was a pronounced difference in composition among zones with the most distinct difference between the inshore zone and the other two zones. The inshore environment was characterised by very high turbidity and low live coral cover; the dominant substrate consisted of algal turf and sand. Environmental conditions improved and sponge diversity increased further offshore, although most areas appeared to have been affected by some form of disturbance. Ordinations were also largely congruent, at species, generic and family levels of taxonomic resolution. This indicates that variation in composition at higher taxonomic levels is a good indicator of variation at lower taxonomic levels, at least when there is a pronounced environmental gradient.

AB  - 1. The objective of the study was to explore the genetic architecture of blood oxygen saturation (SaO) (an indicator trait, negatively correlated with ascites susceptibility), body weight (Weight) and fleshing score (Flesh, a measure of breast conformation) for 4 meat-type chicken lines reared in commercial conditions.
   2. Genetic components, including heritabilities and genetic correlations, were estimated by Restricted Maximum likelihood for these traits measured at 6 weeks of age.
   3. Data were collected over eight generations of selection and pedigrees comprised in excess of 130 000 birds.
   4. Univariate analyses were performed to allow model definition and to obtain starting values for trivariate analyses. The basic model included a random animal effect and, in further models explored, a maternal environmental effect or a genetic maternal effect or both were fitted. Models were compared using likelihood ratio tests.
   5. Estimated heritabilities for SaO ranged from 0.1 to 0.2, and there was no evidence of genetic maternal effects for SaO. The environmental maternal component was significant for one of the populations only. Estimated heritabilities for both Weight and Flesh were between 0.2 and 0.4, and there was evidence of environmental and genetic maternal effects for these traits in all populations.
   6. Genetic correlations between SaO and Weight and between SaO and Flesh were low and negative. This suggests that, in principle, genetic selection to simultaneously increase SaO, and therefore decrease ascites susceptibility, and Weight and Flesh could be performed using traditional (marker-free) selection methods. We discuss how a putative interaction between ascites and production traits could jeopardise the success of such methods.

AB  - Physical models that can be used to obtain realistic accelerograms usually require a thorough knowledge of the source, path, and site effects. In addition, the computational resources needed might be expensive. Thus, empirical models still represent a good alternative for simulating strong ground motion. In this work, we modify and improve the model developed by Sabetta and Pugliese (1996). This new method models the time-domain accelerogram based on the assumption that the phase is random and that the time envelope can be represented by the so-called average instantaneous power. This is, in turn, described as a lognormal distribution for P and S waves combined with an algebro-exponential function representing the envelope of coda waves. In addition, the frequency content of the signal is nonstationary and follows a modified omega-square model. The method depends on four common indicators in earthquake engineering: peak ground acceleration, strong-motion duration, Arias intensity, and central frequency. These indicators are empirically connected to a given database by means of ground-motion prediction equations. In this study we calibrate the model using Japanese data recorded by the K-net array, which has high-quality digital accelerograms and station-site conditions characterized by geotechnical measurements. In addition, this technique permits the inclusion of the uncertainty of the model parameters to take into account the ground-motion natural variability in the stochastic generation of the time histories. The main goal of this work is to provide the earthquake engineering community with a flexible tool to generate realistic accelerograms for dynamic studies.

AB  - Environmental assessment of residue disposal needs to account for long-term changes in leaching conditions. Leaching of heavy metals from incineration residues are highly affected by the leachate pH; the overall environmental consequences of disposing of these residues are therefore greatly influenced by changes in pH over time. The paper presents an approach for assessing pH changes in leachate from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) air-pollution-control (APC) residues. Residue samples were subjected to a stepwise batch extraction method in order to obtain residue samples at a range of pH Values (similar to common pH-dependence tests), and then on these samples to determine leaching of alkalinity as well as remaining solid phase alkalinity. On a range of APC residues covering various pretreatment and disposal options, this procedure was used to determine leachable and residual alkalinity as a function of pH. Mass balance calculations for typical disposal scenarios were used to provide data on pH as a function of the liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio in the leaching system. Regardless of residue type and pretreatment, pH was found to stay above 7 for L/S ratios up to about 2000 L kg(-1) corresponding to about 100 000 years in typical landfill scenarios. It was found that pH changes were mainly governed by alkalinity decreases from leaching processes rather than neutralization reactions. The results suggest that leaching testing for assessment purposes should be carried out in the alkaline range, for example, at pH 9. The paper offers a thorough basis for further modelling of incineration residue leaching and for modelling the environmental consequences of landfilling and utilization of these residues.

AB  - The presence and fate of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment is undergoing increasing Scrutiny. The existing clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data for 81 common compounds were examined for cues of ecotoxicity. Of these the proportions excreted were available for 60 compounds (i.e., 74%). The compounds had a low (<= 0.5%,), a moderately low (6-39%), a relatively high (40-69%), or a high (>= 70%) proportion of the parent compound excreted. More than half of the compounds evaluated have low or moderately low proportions of the parent compound excreted. However, the proportions excreted were negatively but moderately correlated (r = -0.50; n = 13; P = 0.08) with the concentrations of the compounds in the aquatic environment, suggesting that the compounds that have low proportions excreted may also have inherently low degradability in the environment. Solubility, log K-ow, and pK(a), work well in predicting the behavior of PPCPs under clinical conditions and have been used in the environmental assessment of PPCPs prior to approval. However, these parameters did not correlate with the proportion of PPCPs excreted in the environment or their concentration ill the environment, underscoring the need for research into the behavior of PPCPs in the environment. PPCPs occur in low concentrations in the environment and are unlikely to elicit acute toxicity. An ecotoxicity potential that is based oil chronic toxicity, bioavailability, and duration of exposure to nontarget organisms is described Lis a guide in assessing the potency of these compounds in the environment.

AB  - The estimation of grain yield before harvesting could be a very useful tool for breeding programs and productivity forecasting. Canopy reflectance indices have been used for yield estimation, but with limited success. This work was carried out to study the suitability of the visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum of the canopy for the assessment of grain yield in a set of durunt wheat genotypes. Five field experiments, each one including 25 genotypes, were conducted in low, medium and high productivity environments, with average yields of 2.5, 4.5 and 7 t/ha. Spectral reflectance measurements between 400 and 1000 nm were made at anthesis and milk-grain stages. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used in the construction of models that were tested by simple regression between genotype means of predicted and observed grain yields. The empirical models for the estimation of grain yield showed generally stronger and more robust assessment of grain yield than previously assayed spectral indices. For the best model, correlation coefficients between genotype means of predicted and measured yield within each of the five environments ranged from 0.53 to 0.76. We concluded that, although the models did not provide an accurate quantification of grain yield, they could still be used to rank genotypes for breeding purposes. The most reliable ranking of genotypes was attained using measurements made at milk-grain stage on medium to high productivity environments. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a classical paper, Hutchinson (1961) argued that the large number of species in most plankton communities is remarkable in view of the competitive exclusion principle, which suggests that in homogeneous, well-mixed environments species that compete for the same resources cannot coexist. Few ideas in aquatic ecology have evoked more research than this 'paradox of the plankton'. This review is an effort to put the main solutions to the paradox that have been proposed over the years into perspective. Hutchinson himself already suggested that the explanation could be that plankton communities are not in equilibrium at all due to weather-driven fluctuations. Subsequent research confirmed that such externally imposed variability can allow many species to coexist. Another important point is that in practice the homogeneous well-mixed conditions assumed in the competitive exclusion principle hardly exist. Even the open ocean, for instance, has a spatial complexity resulting from meso-scale vortices and fronts that can facilitate coexistence of species. Perhaps most excitingly, theoretical work on species interactions has given a counter-intuitive new dimension to the understanding of diversity. Various competition and predation models suggest that even in homogeneous and constant environments plankton will never settle to equilibrium. Instead, interactions between multiple species may give rise to oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community. Long-term laboratory experiments support this view. This chaotic behavior implies among other things that plankton dynamics are intrinsically unpredictable in the long run when viewed in detail. Nonetheless, on a higher aggregation level, indicators such as total algal biomass may show quite regular patterns.

AB  - Based on its efficacy for the treatment of human asthma, the corticosteroid prednisone is commonly used in horses for treatment of recurrent airway obstruction. However, recent studies have failed to show any benefit of prednisone tablets for the treatment of this condition. The purpose of this study was to determine why oral prednisone has poor efficacy for the treatment of heaves in horses. In a crossover study, 5 horses were given the following treatments: prednisone tablets, prednisone liquid, prednisolone tablets, prednisolone liquid and i.v. prednisolone sodium succinate (positive control). Blood samples were taken before drug administration and at selected time points during a 24 h period. Serum concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone were determined in order to evaluate gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic metabolism. Serum concentrations of the endogenous glucocorticoid hydrocortisone were also determined as an indicator of the biological activity of the drugs. Both prednisolone tablets and liquid were absorbed rapidly, with prednisolone detectable in serum within 15 min of administration and with peak concentrations occurring within 45 min. Small amounts of prednisone were detected in the serum samples after administration of both prednisone tablets and liquid. Prednisolone was not detected in serum samples after administration of prednisone liquid and was detected in serum samples from only one horse after administration of prednisone tablets. Endogenous hydrocortisone production was suppressed when horses received prednisolone. The results of these studies indicate that prednisone has poor efficacy for the treatment of heaves because it is poorly absorbed and the active metabolite prednisolone is rarely produced. In contrast, prednisolone tablets have excellent bioavailability and should be useful as a therapeutic agent in horses.

AB  - Tissue-specific gene expression of the MXR (multixenobiotic resistance) and biotransformation-related gene homologs for the multidrug resistance protein 1 (Mdr 1), the multidrug resistance protein (Mrp), the major vault protein (Mvp, i.e. the lung resistance protein, Lrp), glutathione S-transferase (Gst pi), heat-shock protein 70 gene (Hsp70), and cytochrome p450 (Cyp4A) was analysed in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Additionally, Topoisomerase II (TopoII) and actin were investigated as indicators for mitotic activity and as internal standards. We identified highly conserved regions in the corresponding genes of several other species, and synthesised degenerate olignucleotide primers designed to amplify these regions from M edulis mRNA. Resulting RT-PCR products were cloned into a T-tailed vector and DNA-sequenced. The results were evaluated by computer-based sequence alignment with the known gene sequences of blueprint species. PCR amplified fragments were used as probes for Northern blot hybridisation to identify transcript sizes. Specific oligonucleotide primers were designed from the M. edulis sequences for each gene and used for semi-quantitative multiplex RT-PCR to investigate tissue-specific gene expression. We have cloned and DNA-sequenced segments of the M edulis P-gp, Mvp(Lrp), Gst pi, Hsp70, TopoII and actin genes. Semi-quantitative multiplex RT-PCR rapidly identified characteristic differential gene-expression patterns in a range of mussel tissues, and is therefore a promising tool for comprehensive studies of gene regulation in marine invertebrates in adaptation to various physiological conditions, including responses to natural and anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Most functional imaging studies of memory retrieval investigate memory for standardized laboratory stimuli. However, naturally acquired autobiographical memories differ From memories of standardized stimuli in important ways. Neuroimaging studies of natural memories may reveal distinctive patterns of brain activation and may have particular value in assessing clinical disorders of memory. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activation during successful retrieval of autobiographical memories elicited by name-cued recall of family members and friends. The caudal part of the left posterior cingulate cortex was the most strongly activated region and was significantly activated in all eight subjects studied. Most subjects also showed significant activation of the left anterior orbitomedial, anterior middle Frontal. precuneus, cuneus. and posterior inferior parietal cortices. and the right posterior cingulate and motor cortices.
   Our findings are consistent with prior studies showing posterior cingulate cortex activation during autobiographical memory retrieval. This region is also consistently activated during retrieval of standardized memory stimuli when experimental designs emphasizing successful retrieval are employed. Our results support the hypothesis that the posterior cingulate cortex plays an important role in successful memory retrieval. The posterior cingulate cortex has strong reciprocal connections with entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Studies of early Alzheimer's disease. temporal lobectomy, and hypoxic amnesia show that hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex is an early and prominent indicator of pathology in these patients. Our findings suggest that autobiographical memory retrieval tasks could be used to probe the functional status of the posterior cingulate cortex in patients with early Alzheimers disease or at risk for that condition.

AB  - Among the seven plant bioassays reviewed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Gene-Tox program in 1980, the Allium/Vicia root tip chromosome aberration assay and the Tradescantia stamen hair mutation and micronucleus assays were adopted by the International Program on Plant Bioassays (IPPB) for monitoring or testing environmental pollutants. These assays are highly sensitive and capable of detecting mutagens, clastogens and carcinogens from the environment. They are effective in situ monitors. These bioassays were validated and their protocols were standardized through a program under the International Program on Chemical Safety (IPPB), the precursor of the IPPB program which currently is in operation under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Six different categories of environmental studies, ranging from wastewater, surface or ground water, soil samples, ambient air, pesticides, and radiation, were carried out and are reported in this special issue. The mission of the IPPB/UNEP is to use these bioassays to monitor or test environmental mutagens and clastogens in the air, water, and soil to safeguard the quality of these essential elements in life and to use these simple and clear indicators of pollution damage as the tool for environmental education for the general public. The published reports of the monitoring and testing results will establish the database for environmental conditions in a number of locations around the world. An international monitoring network for the detection of genotoxicity of environmental pollutants is being established under the auspices of UNEP to protect the global environment.

AB  - The need for more long-term studies on helminth communities was addressed by examining changes in composition and diversity of the intestinal helminth component and infracommunities in eels of a small isolated river over 12 years. Examination of samples over one summer season indicated that single samples were representative of community richness in that year. In 1985 the community was species poor(1 species only) and with zero diversity, but by 1996 it comprised six species and all parameters at both levels indicated that it was the richest community yet reported from eels. This overall increase in diversity was not regular or uniform from year to year: rather, the general trend could be reversed in any year(s) and variation between years was considerable. The occurrence of many species was erratic and the identity of the dominant species varied between years. The helminth species that colonised the river contributed to helminth species richness and had an impact on community diversity. It is believed that the overall increase in diversity reflects the changing conditions in the habitat and catchment, but the erratic fluctuations in parameters may reflect the size of the river and the absence of any rescue effects. The findings are compared with the few other long-term studies and it is suggested that the extent of the variation over long periods makes it very difficult to use helminths as indicators of other than general environmental changes or to detect short-term changes due to such specific sources as pollution.

AB  - N-cycling was studied at three Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) sites located within a distance of 30 km in southwest Sweden. Nitrate concentrations in soil water at 50-cm depth differed substantially between the three sites, annual site means being 0, 1, and 9 mg N . L(-1). Using simulated runoff, the leaching of inorganic N from the two sites with the highest concentrations was estimated at, respectively, 7-8 and 19-30 kg . ha(-1) during the hydrological year 1991-1992. The N-deposition measured as throughfall was 31 kg . ha(-1) on the second site, suggesting that it was close to being N-saturated. The differences in nitrate concentration and estimated leaching across sites were not related to differences in forest growth or suggested symptoms of forest decline, such as canopy defoliation and nutrient deficiency. Nitrate concentrations were unrelated to N-deposition in an open field, but positively related to N-deposition in throughfall. However, the difference in N-leaching between the two main sites was much larger than the difference in N-deposition in throughfall. The difference in leaching seemed related to soil conditions. The soil with the highest leaching had the largest potential nitrification and a low C/N ratio (17-20) in the upper part of the profile. Nitrate concentrations in the soil water were positively related to the concentrations of arginine and N-15 in foliage, which supports the use of these two variables as indicators of forests approaching N-saturation.

AB  - The neonatal period in the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) differs markedly from that of most mammals. An intense 1-mo nursing period is followed by 2-3 mo during which seal pups consume neither food nor water. Because skeletal development in other species is rapid during this period, we determined the capability of elephant seals to continue skeletal growth under fasting conditions. We analyzed indirect markers of bone turnover [serum osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase activity and urinary calcium and hydroxyproline (Hyp) excretion] in samples obtained sequentially from live pups throughout the fast. Serum osteocalcin was low at the beginning of the fast, peaked between 17 and 42 days, and then decreased to initial levels after 10 wk. Alkaline phosphatase activity increased Linearly through 9 wk of fasting. Urinary calcium was relatively constant through 9 wk but decreased after 10 wk, whereas free and total Hyp decreased linearly. Clearance of H-3-labeled Hyp showed that virtually all (> 99%) free Hyp was oxidized and that only bound Hyp, for which there is no degradative mechanism, was excreted. Kinetics of Ca-45 clearance, a direct measurement of mineral turnover, was virtually identical to that for young humans. Histomorphometry of ulnae obtained from pups which died of natural causes (usually trauma inflicted by adult males) indicated active surfaces (osteoid plus eroded) between 30 and 60% of total surface of highly porous bone containing < 60% bone area/tissue area. Thus all indicators of skeletal activity confirmed that young elephant seals continue skeletal development, notwithstanding the prolonged period during which they take in no food or water.

AB  - This paper uses data from Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study to explore the association between fuel poverty and a set of wellbeing outcomes: life-satisfaction, self-reported health measures and more objectively measured biomarker data. Over and above the conventional income-fuel cost indicators, we also use more proximal heating deprivation indicators. We create and draw upon a set of composite indicators that concomitantly capture (the lack of) affordability and thermal comfort. Depending on which fuel deprivation indicator is used, we find heterogeneous associations between fuel poverty and our wellbeing outcomes. Employing combined fuel deprivation indicators, which takes into account the income-fuel cost balance and more proximal perceptions of heating adequacy, reveals the presence of more pronounced associations with life satisfaction and fibrinogen, one of our biological health measures. The presence of these strong associations would have been less pronounced or masked when using separately each of the components of our composite fuel deprivation indicators as well as in the case of self-reported generic measures of physical health. Lifestyle and chronic health conditions play a limited role in attenuating our results, while material deprivation partially, but not fully, attenuates our associations between fuel deprivation and wellbeing. These results remain robust when bounding analysis, IV and panel data models are employed to test the potential role of various sources of endogeneity biases. Our analysis suggests that composite fuel deprivation indicators may be useful energy policy instruments for uncovering the underlining mechanism via which fuel poverty may get "under the skin".

AB  - Urban air has its typical structural characteristics. With the continuous optimization of urban human settlement indicators, the key issue and single system of "air quality " in urban human settlements needs to be further discussed. Based on air conditions, this paper attempts to visually measure the spatial-temporal distribution of human settlements in 283 prefecture-level cities in China using ArcGIS and Matlab and tries to reveal the influencing mechanisms: (1) There is no significant difference between the average of the comprehensive score of human settlements in 6 years. The overall level of those in all cities decreases from 0.6581 to 0.6004 year by year, and the average level order in the seven regions of China is Southern China (0.7310) > Southwest China (0.6608) > East China (0.6515) > Northeast China (0.6496) > Northwest China (0.6049)> Central China (0.5901) > North China (0.5565). (2) The global Moran's I index of China's human settlements is between 0.3750-0.7345, showing a positive spatial correlation, and the comprehensive development level has the characteristics of local spatial convergence of low-value clusters in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and high-value clusters in the south coast and Heilongjiang Province. (3) The spatial econometric model tests the influencing mechanism. There is a significant spatial positive correlation between science and technology investment in each city. The urbanization rate, the degree of advanced industrial structure, and the urban average elevation have a certain spatial spillover, showing a negative correlation. Science and technology investment and the degree of advanced industrial structure have the greatest impact.

AB  - Heatwave events over Guangdong have attracted recent attention under changing climate conditions. It is desired to explore the future changes of heatwave due to its associated consequences on society economy and environment. In this study, a stepwise-clustered heatwave downscaling approach (i.e., SCHW) was developed for the projection of HWs in Guangdong. The heatwave indicators (occurrence, duration, magnitude, intensity, frequency, and accumulated intensity) were investigated from both the absolute and relative definitions of heatwave events (i.e., AHWs and RHWs) based on the multi-model ensemble of 13 coupled model intercomparison projected phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The trends (i.e., 0.18-0.29 degrees C per decade under RCP4.5 and 0.30-0.58 degrees C per decade under RCP8.5) of the projected daily maximum temperature indicate that Guangdong would experience continuous warming in the future. The occurrence, frequency, and accumulated intensity of heatwave would increase by 198%, 272%, and 346% in the 2080s (i.e., 2066-2095) under RCP8.5 compared to the historical period (i.e., 1976-2005), respectively. Moreover, the three indicators of HWs are projected to have more substantial increases over inland Guangdong than its costal parts. The spatial variation of occurrence of absolute and relative heatwave under RCP8.5 (2.80 and 2.78) is larger than these under RCP4.5 (2.50 and 2.32) during 2080s (i.e., 2066-2095). The projections of future HWs can help provide valuable information for assessing extreme climate change and identifying desired adaptation strategies.

We examine the importance of water quality as a constraint for shellfish mariculture in South West England and explore how current and projected future land uses are likely to influence ongoing viability. Currently, faecal material from agricultural runoff and municipal wastewater discharges is the main water quality issue affecting the viability of shellfish mariculture. Most UK Shellfish Waters, including those in SW England (-90%), do not consistently meet regulatory standards for faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in shellfish, designed to ensure they are safe for direct human consumption. Other pollutants currently impacting shellfish mariculture include persistent organic pol-lutants and metals, suspended solids and excess nutrient inputs. Emerging pollutants with the potential to impact on mariculture include a range of consumer- industrial-and agri-chemicals, including biocides, pesticides, veterinary and human medicines. We evaluated possible changes in water quality conditions through deriving and exploring a range of future scenarios, considering policies and trends in land use including regenerative and intensive agriculture, renewable energy generation, afforestation, urban development and climate change. Our findings highlight possible trade-offs and synergies between land and water-based food production systems, applicable in SW England and across other regions of the UK and internationally, for helping to inform envi-ronmental policy development and implementation.

AB  - The effects of different spectral compositions of light-emitting diode (LED) sources and fertilizer containing biologically active silicon (Si) in the nutrient solution on morphological and physiological plant response were studied. Qualitative indicators and the productivity of plants of a red-leaved and a green-leaved lettuce were estimated. Lettuce was grown applying low-volume hydroponics in closed artificial agroecosystems. The positive effect of Si fertilizer used as a microadditive in the nutrient solution on the freshly harvested biomass was established on the thirtieth day of vegetation under LEDs. Increase in productivity of the red-leaved lettuce for freshly harvested biomass was 26.6%, while for the green-leaved lettuce no loss of dry matter was observed. However, being grown under sodium lamps, a negative impact of Si fertilizer on productivity of both types of plants was observed: the amount of harvested biomass decreased by 22.6% and 30.3% for the green- and red-leaved lettuces, respectively. The effect of using Si fertilizer dramatically changed during the total growing period: up to the fifteenth day of cultivation, a sharp inhibition of the growth of both types of lettuce was observed; then, by the thirtieth day of LED lighting, Si fertilizer showed a stress-protective effect and had a positive influence on the plants. However, by the period of ripening there was no effect of using the fertilizer. Therefore, we can conclude that the use of Si fertilizers is preferable only when LED irradiation is applied throughout the active plant growth period.

AB  - Pathogens and chemical contaminants in stormwater are major environmental and public health concerns. Characterizing the variability in composition and bioremediation functions of the microbial community from different sources of stormwater will help with efforts to properly manage water after it rains. To improve understanding of the variability and composition of the microbial community in run-off from different sources, we sampled stormwater over time from an outfall and receiving stream, along with run-off from different locations (rooftop, roadway) to identify microbial components associated with these urban waters. Community composition was variable in space and time for water samples from the same source. Even with this variability, we found taxonomic and functional groups differentially distributed in water samples collected during wet or dry weather or collected from different sources. The differentially distributed taxonomic and functional groups represent the unique characteristics of the source, such as when communities are exposed to iron in pipe material from the outfall or hydrocarbons flushed from various surfaces during rain events. Additionally, fecal indicator sequences from Clostridiales and Bacteroidales taxa made up a larger fraction of the microbial community from water collected under dry conditions. Our work characterizes the variability in microbial community composition and functions from a variety of urban water sources, with specific attention to communities from sources where water might be collected or treated with green infrastructure systems (e.g. rain gardens or biofilters). This will aid our understanding of the impact of human activities in urban environments on the surrounding water system.

AB  - Patterns of watershed nitrogen (N) retention and loss are shaped by how watershed biogeochemical processes retain, biogeochemically transform, and lose incoming atmospheric deposition of N. Loss patterns represented by concentration, discharge, and their associated stream exports are important indicators of integrated watershed N retention behaviors. We examined continental United States (CONUS) scale N deposition (e.g., wet and dry atmospheric deposition), vegetation trends, and stream trends as potential indicators of watershed N-saturation and retention conditions, and how watershed N retention and losses vary over space and time. By synthesizing changes and modalities in watershed nitrogen loss patterns based on stream data from 2200 U.S. watersheds over a 50 years record, our work revealed two patterns of watershed N-retention and loss. One was a hysteresis pattern that reflects the integrated influence of hydrology, atmospheric inputs, land-use, stream temperature, elevation, and vegetation. The other pattern was a one-way transition to a new state. We found that regions with increasing atmospheric deposition and increasing vegetation health/biomass patterns have the highest N-retention capacity, become increasingly N-saturated over time, and are associated with the strongest declines in stream N exports-a pattern, that is, consistent across all land cover categories. We provide a conceptual model, validated at an unprecedented scale across the CONUS that links instream nitrogen signals to upstream mechanistic landscape processes. Our work can aid in the future interpretation of in-stream concentrations of DOC and DIN as indicators of watershed N-retention status and integrators of watershed hydrobiogeochemical processes.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, consumers are more aware about what they eat and how it is packaged. Food quality is of paramount importance and consumers are eager to be constantly updated about the perishability and shelf-life of the food products they buy. This gave rise to intelligent packaging (IP) materials and devices that can communicate with all people throughout the entire food route. One of the main colour-based IP systems is based on the use of anthocyanin (ATH)-based natural dyes by exploiting their pH-dependent colour changes that can be easily readable by the naked eye.
   Scope and approach: This review focuses on recent studies regarding ATH-based sensor packaging materials development for IP applications, offering valuable insights regarding the main factors that affect the efficacy of the developed IP, such as the material where the ATH is anchored, ATH type and concentration, the ingredients used in the formulation of the sensor and the storage conditions of the food product. Additionally, the last ATHbased IP developed are also summed and discussed in detail to identify the major bottlenecks that need to be overcome for accelerating the commercial application of ATH-based sensors in IP.
   Key findings and conclusions: Although ATH-based indicators are able to correctly indicate food shelf-life in several products at a laboratory scale, their industrial production is still impaired by the production methods used for this type of sensors. Furthermore, ATHs are labile compounds that require stabilization in the packaging material to yield stable, standardized and durable IP materials.

AB  - The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus is a complex system operating at many scales, the importance of which is increasingly recognized in academia and policy. There are calls to expand the nexus to include land and climate (WEFLC) as well as to narrow the science-policy divide, implying conducting assessments at policy-relevant scales to assess the impacts of policy objectives. This paper presents a national-scale WEFLC nexus system dynamics modelling assessment for Latvia. Qualitative and quantitative assessment was performed with local stakeholders to validate model structure, data, results, and to gather information on Latvian policy objectives and implement them in the model as potential future policies. Under baseline conditions (i.e. without implementing goal-specific policies under shared socio-economic pathway 2), results indicate a levelling off of consumption by 2050 while production of food products and energy is expected to increase. Nitrogen losses and climate emissions increase, going against policy targets. Implementation of indicative policies has desired impacts within their given sector, but may lead to trade-offs in others. Implementing multiple policies simultaneously may augment or hinder progress towards objectives due to system interconnectedness. Therefore, when choosing which policies to implement, cross-sectoral implications must be carefully considered. This work offers insight for policy and decision making in Latvia, hinting at policy options to pursue, and highlighting those to avoid. This study offers suggestions for closing the science-policy divide including the use of visual serious game environments for results interpretation, the use of selected indicators for nexus performance assessment, and close stakeholder engagement throughout a project.

AB  - An environmental survey was conducted in order to assess the frequency of detection of picobirnavirus (PBV), human adenovirus (HAdV) and infective enterovirus (iEV) as indicators of faecal contamination in freshwater, and to determine their potential as reporters of the presence of other enteric viruses, such as group A rotavirus (RVA). The study was carried out over a three-year period (2013-2015) in the San Roque Dam, Cordoba, Argentina. The overall frequency detection was 62.9% for PBV, 64.2% for HAdV and 70.4% for iEV. No significant differences were observed in the rates of detection for any of these viruses through the years studied, and a seasonal patternwas not present. Whenever therewas RVA detection in the samples analyzed, therewas also detection of iEV and/or HAdV and/or PBV. At least one of the viral groups analyzed was demonstrated in the 100% of the samples with faecal coliforms values within the guideline limits. In this setting, especially in those samples which reveal faecal indicator bacteria within the guideline limit, we propose to carry out a pathway, involving PBV, HAdV and iEV detection in order to enhance the evaluation of microbiological quality in freshwater in Argentina. The proposed methodological strategy could report faecal contamination in water, mainly of human origin, and the condition of the matrix to maintain viral viability. In addition, the viral groups selected could report the presence of RV. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Monitoring of soybean genotypes is important because of intellectual property over seed technology, better management over seed genetics, and more efficient strategies for its agricultural production process. This paper aims at spectrally classifying soybean genotypes submitted to diverse water availability levels at different phenological stages using leaf-based hyperspectral reflectance. Leaf reflectance spectra were collected using a hyperspectral proximal sensor. Two experiments were conducted as field trials: one experiment was at Embrapa Soja in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019 cropping seasons, where ten soybean genotypes were grown under four water conditions; and another experiment was in the experimental farm of Unoeste University in the 2018/2019 cropping season, where nine soybean genotypes were evaluated. The spectral data collected was divided into nine spectral datasets, comprising single and multiple cropping seasons (from 2016 to 2019), and two contrasting crop-growing environments. Principal component analysis, applied as an indicator of the explained variance of the reflectance spectra among genotypes within each spectral dataset, explained over 94% of the spectral variance in the first three principal components. Linear discriminant analysis, used to obtain a model of classification of each reflectance spectra of soybean leaves into each soybean genotype, achieved accuracy between 61% and 100% in the calibration procedure and between 50% and 100% in the validation procedure. Misclassification was observed only between genotypes from the same genetic background. The results demonstrated the great potential of the spectral classification of soybean genotypes at leaf-scale, regardless of the phenological stages or water status to which plants were submitted.

AB  - The present study is an attempt to utilize cenogram methodology (both qualitative and quantitative) to consider mammalian communities from five early to late Eocene localities across the globe (i.e., Polecat Bench, Bighorn Basin, North America; Abbey Wood, Blackheath Formation, UK; Cambay Shale, Cambay Basin, India; Wutu Formation, Wutu Basin, China; Pondaung Formation, Myanmar) so as to provide a comparative palaeohabitat framework. It is also a first attempt to examine the palaeohabitat of an extinct mammalian community (i.e., from Cambay Shale) in India utilizing the cenogram approach. In addition, seven extinct middle-Miocene communities (Laogou, Linxia Basin, China; Estacion Imperial, Spain; Paseo de las Acacias, Spain; Arroyo del Olivar-Puente de Vallecas, Spain; Somo-saguas, Spain; Paracuellos 5, Spain; Paracuellos 3, Spain) have also been considered, in order to provide a global perspective to the climatic inferences in a temporal context. The majority of statistical calculations for Paleogene communities expose forested and humid conditions, excluding the Cambay Shale mammalian community of India. A hidden diversity within the medium to large body-size category of mammals (disguising the mammal biodiversity expected in tropical forested habitats) from Cambay Shale (western India) is a plausible cause of digression in the results. This is reflected in the histograms showing relationships between proportions of mammal species in various body-mass categories. Furthermore, the results show that Neogene mammalian communities were sustained in comparatively open habitats. Differences between occidental European and Asian localities in the canopy and humidity of the Neogene environments are also reflected in our analyses.

AB  - According to the measured value of clayey water electrical conductivity (EC) of xz-horehole core samples from the south bank plain of the Haihe River in Tianjin, the marine and continental strata of the xz-borehole core were divided. From bottom to top, the core represents the regression process of a neritic facies deposit (Zone I), intertidal deposit (Zone II), and continental deposit (Zone III). The hydrodynamic conditions of xz-horehole marine facies, sea land transitional facies, and terrestrial strata were analyzed by grain-size analysis methods such as probability accumulation curve and CM diagram, and the sedimentary facies were further divided according to sediment grain size and sorting characteristics. Zone I is subdivided into a neritic facies deposit with a finer grain size and hydrodynamic stability (I-1 and I-3), a neritic facies deposit with a coarser grain size and stronger hydrodynamic force (I-2), and a delta front deposit with rapid EC value decline and a coarse grain size (I-4). Zone HI, with a low EC value, is subdivided into fine-grained floodplain flooding plain sediments (III-2) and coarse-grained crevasse splay sediments (III-1). High-energy hydrodynamic events in the deposition process can be accurately identified with grain-size analysis and EC indicators. Therefore, it can make up for the defect that EC cannot further refine the internal sedimentary facies for the marine facies, transitional facies, and continental facies. It has a good effect on the detailed differentiation of sediments and sedimentary facies in the coastal plain, and the identification of sedimentary events.

AB  - In this article, a new damage indicator is presented that can detect a (partial) load path failure for a multiple load path structure, based on variable amplitude strain response measurements by fiber optic Bragg grating sensors. Many (aircraft) structures have multiple load paths where after a (partial) failure of a load path the remaining structure can carry the limit load without catastrophic failure or too severe impact on the operational characteristics of the whole structure, until the structure is repaired, replaced, or modified. The damage indicator is defined as a ratio of the strain response summation of the current strain time variation measured at fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors and a reference strain time variation measured at the same FBGs. For application in real structures with varying loads and environmental conditions, it should be insensitive for the load time variation as well as temperature. The FBG strain response due to a load variation can be easily computed by means of a finite element analyses. In this way, an optimal number, location and orientation of strain sensors can be derived for complex structures. A test was performed on a box-shaped structure representative of a typical aircraft structure to validate the damage indicator, showing that the damage indicator is able to detect a damaged load path at an early stage of failure with few sensors per load path. From finite element analyses, the damage size can even be determined from the damage indicator value for a known damage scenario, making it a level 3 structure health monitoring system.

AB  - Aquatic organisms with different adaptations are used as indicators in physical habitat simulation system models. Those adaptations are critical for determining the shape of the weighted usable area/width curve and for recommending values of environmental flows. The main objective of this study is to compare the use of benthic native species (Astroblepus taczanowskii and Astroblepus vanceae) versus the introduced Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) as target indicators for PHABSIM modelling in the Andean-Amazon piedmont rivers. We used adjusted probability distribution functions with L-moments analyses for developing curves of use and preference to evaluate the efficiency of each indicator. Two hydraulic modelling sections were established in the Ulcumayo River with 21 and 27 cross sections, respectively. Native benthic species are usually dominant but scarcely used as focus organisms for environmental flows modelling. These species are associated with fast running and shallow waters, which makes them potentially more sensitive to the effects of flow reduction. Our results indicated that the native species were more restricted to velocity and depth than O. mykiss. Using selection curves in PHABSIM modelling, it is required between 10% to 94% of the mean monthly flow to preserve 90% of the available habitat for Astroblepus during the dry season (May to November). In contrast, rainbow trout requires 5% to 88% of the mean monthly flow. We conclude that a multispecies approach is useful for determining the required environmental instream flows contributing to a better sustainable condition for the Neotropical mountain rivers.

AB  - The tendency of depletion of non-renewable resources and the environment's continuous degradation have been considered in the last centuries acceptable as side effects for achieving the economic growth and satisfying the human needs in the conditions of demographic growth following an upward trend. An adequate response to all these challenges is related to increasing the share of green GDP in total GDP, to green procurement and to the large-scale promotion of circular economy. At EU level, there are appropriate legislation and programs and packages aimed at implementing green procurement and the circular economy. There are also "prize-winner" countries that have adopted National Green Procurement Plans before they became mandatory, countries that have found it harder to adopt this type of plans, but also countries that have not adopted National Green Procurement Plans such as Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and Romania.
   The article focuses on an analysis of the impact of national green procurement plans adoption on circular economy in the European Union member states for the period 2007-2018, with the help of an unrestricted VAR panel (PVAR), based on three hypotheses according to which the impact of these plans' adoption is positive on economic growth, CO2 emissions and circular economy. Data taken from Eurostat and processed using E-Views 9 econometric software allowed the validation of research hypotheses, confirming the positive impact of the adoption and implementation of green procurement national plans on some significant indicators characterizing the circular economy, which is likely to encourage the generalization of concerns regarding the adoption of coherent public policies in all Member States.

AB  - This study aims to determine the composition of fish species based on sea waters in the Province South Sulawesi This study will also map the extent of fishing grounds. This research was carried out in the Siddo section (Barru Regency), in the southern part of Tana Beru (Bulukumba Regency), in the eastern part of South Sulawesi in Wara (Palopo City). The data analysis used descriptive analysis, to layout follow table and graphics the condition of the general capture data and oceanographic indicator. This research use to capture productivity analysis to calculate and determinant the value of effort fishing activity, the effective length of fishing (calculated from the start of the lamp until the ring has been raised to the deck of the ship) and the composition of the type of catch. The result showed the proportion of purse seine catches operating in spermonde waters shows a different proportion based on the time of capture. At the time of the first capture, it showed the type of flying fish that had the largest proportion, namely 25.3% or 3200 kg of the total catch of 12,624.5kg. At the time of catching the two types of fish that were dominant were types of anchovies, which reached 43.6% or 5,500kg of the total catch of 24,246kg. Evaluation of fish distribution is not easy because the nature of migratory small pelagic fish, thus determining the state of small pelagic fish stocks in an area of water was relatively easy.

AB  - The effects of long-term cold stimulation on the immune function of ileum and adaptability to cold stress in broilers were examined. A total of 360 Arbor Acres broilers was divided into 3 groups and four replicates per group. C (control) was reared in normal thermal environment. C-3 and C-12 (treatments) were kept in cold condition of 3 or 12 degrees C lower than the temperature of C from days 8 to 42. At day 42, all the groups were exposed to an acute cold stress challenge, designated as S, S-3, and 5-12. The mRNA levels of immune molecules and heat shock proteins as well as oxidative stress-related indicators in ileum tissues, and immunoglobulins contents in serum were examined at 14, 42, and 43 d of age. The C-3 regimen had no adverse effect on production performance, whereas the C12 regimen reduced the production performance relative to C (P < 0.05). At day 42, C-3 had higher levels of immune indexes (P < 0.05), whereas C-12 had lower levels than C (P < 0.05). No differences in levels of oxidative stress-related indicators were found between C and C-3 at day 42 (P > 0.05). S-3 had higher levels of immune indexes and lower levels of oxidative stress-related indicators (P < 0.05), as compared to S and S-12. The results suggest that 34 d of cold stimulation at 3 degrees C lower than the normal temperature had no adverse impacts on production performance but enhanced the immunity of ileum and adaptability to acute cold challenge in broilers.

AB  - The third global-scale coral bleaching event, triggered by the 2015-2016 El Nino, presented unprecedented levels of thermal stress and bleaching occurrence. Identification of potential cellular biomarkers in key reef species can greatly improve coral reef resource manager's ability to make ecological forecasts and develop efficient mitigation strategies. In this context, the present study evaluated ecologically relevant biochemical parameters involved in thermal-stress response in two important reef building species of southwestern Atlantic Reefs - the scleractinian coral Mussismilia harttii and the hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis - aiming to assess their potential to forecast bleaching occurrence in corals/hydrocorals. Bleaching frequency, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as well as thermal stress parameters (Degree Heating Weeks, DHW), were monitored during a six-month period in a reef area under influence of the 2015-2016 El Nino event. LPO is suggested as an informative, cost-effective and logical complement to reef monitoring programs; and TAC basal level as a potential measurement for predicting corals/hydrocorals susceptibility to bleaching. Further, results indicate M. alcicornis as a promising bioindicator in South Atlantic reefs. Findings presented here are expected to improve South Atlantic coral reef monitoring programs, as well as to contribute with potential biomarker-monitoring techniques to be used as additional tools in traditional reef monitoring programs worldwide. Further, observations on oxidative stress responses of a hydrocoral undergoing thermal stress conditions in the field are reported here for the first time.

AB  - In recent years, more and more manufacturers and operators of fleets of mobile systems have been focusing their efforts on studying and developing conditional maintenance, monitoring, and diagnostic strategies to cope with an increasingly competitive, unstable, costly, and unpredictable environment. This paper proposes a case study concerning the application of a novel event management architecture, called EMH2, to a fleet of trains. This EMH2 architecture, which applies the holonic paradigm, aims to facilitate the monitoring and diagnosis of a fleet of mobile systems. It is based on a recursive decomposition of cooperative monitoring holons. The definition of a generic event modeling, called SurfEvent, is the second key element of the contribution. EMH2 has been designed to be applicable to any kind of system or equipment up to fleet level. The edge computing paradigm has been adopted for implementation purpose. The EMH2 architecture is designed to facilitate asynchronous and progressive onboard and off-board deployments. A real-world application of EMH2 to a fleet of ten trains currently in use, in collaboration with our industrial partner, Bombardier Transport, is presented. Three key performances indicators have been estimated by comparing EMH2 with the current industrial situation. These indicators are (1) the number of fleet maintenance visits, (2) the time needed by a maintenance operator to investigate and diagnose, and (3) the time needed by the system to update data regarding the health status and monitoring of trains. Results obtained outperformed industrial expectations. The paper finally discusses feedbacks from experience and limitations of the work.

AB  - The contents of photosynthetic pigments are an important indicator of many processes taking place in the plant body. Still, however, our knowledge of the effects of polyploidization, a major driver of speciation in vascular plants, on the contents of photosynthetic pigments is very sparse. We compared the contents of photosynthetic pigments among natural diploids, natural tetraploids, and synthetic tetraploids. The material originated from four natural mixed-cytotype populations of diploid and autotetraploid Vicia cracca (Fabaceae) occurring in the contact zone between the cytotypes in Central Europe and was cultivated under uniform conditions. We explored whether the contents of pigments are primarily driven by polyploidization or by subsequent evolution of the polyploid lineage and whether the patterns differ between populations. We also explored the relationship between pigment contents and plant performance. We found very few significant effects of the cytotype on the individual pigments but many significant interactions between the cytotype and the population. In pair-wise comparisons, many comparisons were not significant. The prevailing pattern among the significant once was that the contents of pigments were determined by polyploidization rather than by subsequent evolution of the polyploid lineage. The contents of the pigments turned out to be a useful predictor of plant performance not only at the time of material collection, but also at the end of the growing season. Further studies exploring differences in the contents of photosynthetic pigments in different cytotypes using replicated populations and assessing their relationship to plant performance are needed to assess the generality of our findings.

AB  - The distributive environmental justice literature has expanded beyond examining only race- and class-based injustices, but no studies have focused on religion's influence on disparate environmental risks. We address that gap using data from the decennial U.S. Census, American Community Survey, and Environmental Protection Agency for 2010 census tracts to examine a proxy measure of Mormon prevalence, racial and ethnic composition, and socioeconomic status as predictors of seven indicators of outdoor air pollution in metropolitan Salt Lake City, Utah. Results from multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses show that greater Mormon prevalence and white composition each independently predict lower levels of air pollution; moreover, Mormon prevalence and whiteness are the strongest predictors in the models. Results also demonstrate that greater proportions of Hispanic, black, and Pacific Islander residents predict higher levels of air pollution, suggesting that systemic white privilege oppresses those groups such that they experience air pollution disparities. Mormons are socially privileged in Salt Lake City, and findings indicate that their collective power serves to protect them from air pollution. Exploratory GEE interaction analyses reveal that disparities in exposure to particulate matter based on higher Hispanic composition are attenuated under conditions of high Mormon prevalence. Findings indicate that white privilege or racial oppression and Mormon privilege operate distinctively and, to a lesser degree, interactively as determinants of distributive environmental injustices in Salt Lake City. Although affiliation with a contextually dominant religion (Mormonism) among residents in Salt Lake City shapes neighborhood patterns of environmental inequality, future studies should examine the role of religion in both producing and ameliorating environmental injustice.

AB  - The main drinking water source supplying Uruguay (Santa Lucia River, SLR) was threatened in 2013 by a cyanobacterial bloom transported downstream to the water treatment plant that provides water to half of this country population. Several eutrophic reservoirs and stabilization ponds located in the river basin may have been the source of cyanobacterial populations. Such conditions may be common in productive basins; however, few studies have evaluated the impact of microalgae from wastewater stabilization ponds on rivers and its viability downstream. The effect of a dairy wastewater effluent on SLR was studied by means of nutrient and chlorophyll a loads, phytoplankton composition, and effluent incubation in river water in order to evaluate the potential development of cyanobacteria. Total phosphorus and nitrogen loads of the effluent reached up to 25% and 17% of SLR, respectively, while chlorophyll a was up to 37%. The upstream-downstream evaluation showed an increase in dissolved phosphorus and chlorophyll a. The effluent phytoplankton (14.16mm(3)L(-1)) was dominated by organisms <10m and diatoms (91%), and 3% of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria were not detected in SLR, though it appeared downstream of the effluent discharge. At the end of the bioassay, cyanobacterial biomass became the dominant group (37%). This study shows the potential development of cyanobacteria present in industrial effluents when diluted in river water. The effect of phytoplankton discharge from stabilization ponds is not generally considered in monitoring assessments and environment management, despite representing a particular risk if the water body is used as a drinking water source.

AB  - The aim of the present work involves a comparative analysis of the changes in the absolute content of the main fatty acid (FA) component of the total lipid amount in wheat calli (Triticum aestivum L.) under the action of low-intensity laser radiation (LILR), as well as an assessment of the influence of the FA proportion calculation method on the resultant picture of the FA change dynamics. The content of major FAs in callus tissue and its changes when exposed to LILR were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A comparative analysis of the calculation results of the absolute (mu g/g dry weight) and relative (in %wt. of the sum of the areas of chromatographic peaks) content of the target components (palmitic, stearic, linoleic and linolenic acids) was carried out. When comparing the two calculation methods, no qualitative differences in the change dynamics were observed. At the same time, significant differences were found between the quantitative indicators of the FA content in absolute and relative units. For example, the absolute amount of monounsaturated oleic acid five minutes increased by 23% following the removal of laser radiation, while the relative amount increased by only 14%. For polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acids, this difference was even more significant. In general, the trends in changes caused by irradiation in the main fatty acid content compared with the total callus lipids appear to be similar to the stress response of plant tissue to adverse environmental conditions. The scope of two methods for calculating the content of FAs is also discussed.

AB  - Antarctic krill is a vital part of the food web and supports a significant fishery in the Southern Ocean. Shifts in historical fishing grounds and spatial distribution of catches have occurred as a result of recent changes in fishery practices. To understand these shifts, fishery spatial dynamics and fishing fleet behavior evaluated on different spatial and temporal scales are critical. We examine the catch distribution on three spatial-temporal scales. At the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) scale, we assessed the fleet's southward expansion, identifying the Bransfield Strait (BS) as the main current fishing ground, replacing the historical Drake sector. At the BS scale, we identified fishing hotspots (FHs) that concentrated 48%-57% of the total catch over a period of 2-6 months and had high catch densities (2.2-30.3 ton km(-2)). At the FH scale, we tracked the spatial distribution of the fleet within FHs, demonstrating a shift of fishing vessels to contiguous zones as a result of a decrease in daily catch rates (CPUE). Such shifts (allowing the fleet to increase CPUE) occurred every 4-17 days. Previously exploited fishing grounds were revisited based on FH persistence and sea ice conditions. This paper concludes with a discussion of the potential impact of fishing fleet behavior and catch concentration, considering the recent spatial shift towards less-exploited areas, the overlap with critical zones for predator feeding, and several implications for fisheries management.

AB  - Understanding spatial patterns of Escherichia coli in freshwater sediments is necessary to characterize sediments as microbial reservoirs and to evaluate the impact of sediment resuspension on microbial water quality in watersheds. Sediment particle size distributions and streambed E. coli concentrations were measured along a 500-m-long reach of a first-order creek 1 d before and on Days 1, 3, 6, and 10 after each of two artificial high-flow events, with natural high-flow events also occurring within the sampling periods. Spatial variability of E. coli was greater in sediments than in water within any given sampling; however, variation between sampling days was greater for water than for sediment. The mean relative difference analysis revealed temporally stable patterns of E. coli concentrations in sediments. Escherichia coli-rich locations along the reach corresponded to areas with higher organic matter and fine particle contents. Although low (k < 0.5 d(-1)) or negative survival rates were observed at most locations along the reach during times where no precipitation was recorded, a small number of locations showed such large concentration increase that on average the survival rate remained positive at the reach scale. The studied creek appears to have hot spots of concentration increase, where conditions for E. coli populations to increase are much more favorable than in most other locations across the reach. The effect of this increase can be seen at the reach scale but is difficult to discern without individual sampling that is dense in space and time.

AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) mineralization is variably affected by management and edaphic conditions. A routine soil test that reflects both soil biological activity and N mineralization could improve predictions for N fertilizer recommendations to cereal grains on different soil types and landscape settings. We collected soils from 47 corn production fields in North Carolina and Virginia at depths of 0 to 10, 10 to 20, and 20 to 30 cm and evaluated soil C and N characteristics in association with sorghum-sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench ssp. Drummondii] dry matter production and N uptake during 6 to 8 wk of growth in the greenhouse. Plant dry matter and N uptake were strongly associated, as expected. Plant available N (sum of net N mineralization during 24 d of aerobic incubation + residual inorganic N) had the strongest association with plant dry matter production (r(2) = 0.76) and N uptake (r(2) = 0.85). However, the flush of CO2 during a 0- to 3-d period following rewetting of dried soil was nearly equally effective at r(2) = 0.74 and r(2) = 0.76, respectively. Multiple regression models with 4 +/- 2 additional variables led to r(2) = 0.88 +/- 0.10 among different separations of data based on depth, region, and soil textural class. We suggest the optimum combination of variables to predict soil N availability would be the flush of CO2, residual inorganic N, and total soil N concentration, as they balance relevant scientific information with limited soil-testing resources (time and labor). We demonstrated that the flush of CO2 was a rapid and reliable indicator of soil N availability.

AB  - As any stone substrate is susceptible to biological colonisation, the choice of lithotype used for construction is a key strategy for preventing biodeterioration. For this purpose, a comprehensive evaluation of the primary bioreceptivity to phototrophic biofilms of eleven varieties of granitic rocks, commonly used as building material, was carried out. Blocks were inoculated with a multi-species phototrophic culture and subjected to standardised growth conditions for three months. Biofilm formation was assessed by chlorophyll (chl) fluorescence, colour measurements and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) quantification. Relationships between the biofilm growth indicators and the properties of the different rocks studied were then analysed. Results showed that the bioreceptivity of the granites is more strongly affected by the physical characteristics of the stones than by their chemical and mineralogical properties, possibly because of the similar composition of the rocks studied. Growth of phototrophic biofilms was enhanced by high open porosity, capillary water content and surface roughness, and the bioreceptivity of weathered granites was higher than that of sound granites. The results obtained can therefore help in the selection of appropriate lithotypes for building purposes. The amounts of EPS produced by subaerial biofilms primarily depended on the requirements and/or characteristics of the biofilm-forming microorganisms, rather than on the bioreceptivity of the substratum, and microorganisms produce the amounts of EPS required at the initial stage of establishment on the stone surface, independently of the subsequent biomass development. These findings are especially important from the point of view of biodeterioration, in which the EPS matrix plays a central role. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chlorophyll (Chl) is a distinctive component of autotrophic organisms, often used as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean. However, assessment of phytoplankton biomass from Chl relies on the accurate estimation of the Chl:carbon(C) ratio. Here we present global patterns of Chl:C ratios in the surface ocean obtained from a phytoplankton growth model that accounts for the optimal acclimation of phytoplankton to ambient nutrient, light, and temperature conditions. The model agrees largely with observed/expected global patterns of Chl:C. Combining our Chl:C estimates with satellite Chl and particulate organic carbon (POC), we infer phytoplankton C concentration in the surface ocean and its contribution to the total POC pool. Our results suggest that the portion of POC corresponding to living phytoplankton is higher in subtropical latitudes and less productive regions (similar to 30-70%) and decreases to similar to 10-30% toward high latitudes and productive regions. An important caveat of our model is the lack of iron limiting effects on phytoplankton physiology. Comparison of our predicted phytoplankton biomass with an independent estimate of total POC reveals a positive correlation between nitrate concentrations and nonphotosynthetic POC in the surface ocean. This correlation disappears when a constant Chl:C is applied. Our analysis is not constrained by assumptions of constant Chl:C or phytoplankton:POC ratio, providing a novel independent analysis of phytoplankton biomass in the surface ocean. These results highlight the importance of accounting for the variability in Chl:C and its application in distinguishing the autotrophic and heterotrophic components in the assemblage of the marine plankton ecosystem.

AB  - The 1st EuNetAir Air Quality Joint Intercomparison Exercise organized in Aveiro (Portugal) from 13th-27th October 2014, focused on the evaluation and assessment of environmental gas, particulate matter (PM) and meteorological microsensors, versus standard air quality reference methods through an experimental urban air quality monitoring campaign. The IDAD-Institute of Environment and Development Air Quality Mobile Laboratory was placed at an urban traffic location in the city centre of Aveiro to conduct continuous measurements with standard equipment and reference analysers for CO, NOX, O-3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation and precipitation.
   The comparison of the sensor data generated by different microsensor-systems installed side-by-side with reference analysers, contributes to the assessment of the performance and the accuracy of microsensor-systems in a real-world context, and supports their calibration and further development.
   The overall performance of the sensors in terms of their statistical metrics and measurement profile indicates significant differences in the results depending on the platform and on the sensors considered. In terms of pollutants, some promising results were observed for O-3 (r(2): 0.12-0.77), CO (r(2): 0.53-0.87), and NO2 (r(2): 0.02-0.89). For PM (r(2): 0.07-036) and SO2 (r(2): 0.09-0.20) the results show a poor performance with low correlation coefficients between the reference and microsensor measurements. These field observations under specific environmental conditions suggest that the relevant microsensor platforms, if supported by the proper post processing and data modelling tools, have enormous potential for new strategies in air quality control.

AB  - In common lilac, natural flower bud formation starts in July and proceeds until the end of October, when deep dormancy begins, allowing buds to overwinter. In spring after winter chilling, generative lilac buds resume growth and bloom in May. With the use of forcing procedures, blooming of common lilac is possible in autumn and winter when buds are typically in a deep dormancy state. The temperature commonly used to begin the forcing cycle of lilac in autumn is 37A degrees C, while 16A degrees C is sufficient to induce flowering in March. Such high temperatures applied in November cause degeneration of flowers, which may be due to an oxidative stress following the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of this study was to determine and compare the concentration of the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of lipid peroxidation; and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in flowers of common lilac under natural flowering conditions and forced flowering at 37A degrees C or 15A degrees C. The highest H2O2 content and the lowest catalase (CAT) activity were observed in lilacs forced at 37A degrees C. Flowers collected from lilacs forced under 15A degrees C had the highest content of soluble proteins, peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and the lowest H2O2 content. These results indicate that forcing shrubs, even those in a deep dormancy state, under low (15A degrees C) temperature protects the antioxidant defense system and allows the plant to produce panicles of high quality, though the flowering date is delayed compared to the standard forcing procedure conducted at 37A degrees C.

AB  - Phenomapping is an approach which allows the derivation of spatial patterns of vegetation phenology and rangeland productivity based on time series of vegetation indices. In our study, we propose a new spatial mapping approach which combines phenometrics derived from high resolution (HR) satellite time series with spatial logistic regression modeling to discriminate land management systems in rangelands. From the RapidEye time series for selected rangelands in South Africa, we calculated bi-weekly noise reduced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. For the growing season of 2011-2012, we further derived principal phenology metrics such as start, end and length of growing season and related phenological variables such as amplitude, left derivative and small integral of the NDVI curve. We then mapped these phenometrics across two different tenure systems, communal and commercial, at the very detailed spatial resolution of 5 m. The result of a binary logistic regression (BLR) has shown that the amplitude and the left derivative of the NDVI curve were statistically significant. These indicators are useful to discriminate commercial from communal rangeland systems. We conclude that phenomapping combined with spatial modeling is a powerful tool that allows efficient aggregation of phenology and productivity metrics for spatially explicit analysis of the relationships of crop phenology with site conditions and management. This approach has particular potential for disaggregated and patchy environments such as in farming systems in semi-arid South Africa, where phenology varies considerably among and within years. Further, we see a strong perspective for phenomapping to support spatially explicit modelling of vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microorganisms are the most abundant lifeform on Earth, mediating global fluxes of matter and energy. Over the past decade, high-throughput molecular techniques generating multiomic sequence information (DNA, mRNA, and protein) have transformed our perception of this microcosmos, conceptually linking microorganisms at the individual, population, and community levels to a wide range of ecosystem functions and services. Here, we develop a biogeochemical model that describes metabolic coupling along the redox gradient in Saanich Inlet-a seasonally anoxic fjord with biogeochemistry analogous to oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). The model reproduces measured biogeochemical process rates as well as DNA, mRNA, and protein concentration profiles across the redox gradient. Simulations make predictions about the role of ubiquitous OMZ microorganisms in mediating carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. For example, nitrite "leakage" during incomplete sulfide-driven denitrification by SUP05 Gammaproteobacteria is predicted to support inorganic carbon fixation and intense nitrogen loss via anaerobic ammonium oxidation. This coupling creates a metabolic niche for nitrous oxide reduction that completes denitrification by currently unidentified community members. These results quantitatively improve previous conceptual models describing microbial metabolic networks in OMZs. Beyond OMZ-specific predictions, model results indicate that geochemical fluxes are robust indicators of microbial community structure and reciprocally, that gene abundances and geochemical conditions largely determine gene expression patterns. The integration of real observational data, including geochemical profiles and process rate measurements as well as meta-genomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic sequence data, into a biogeochemical model, as shown here, enables holistic insight into the microbial metabolic network driving nutrient and energy flow at ecosystem scales.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) generated from mining activities has been recognized as a serious problem due to its increased acidity and high concentration of heavy metals. In this research, a feasibility test of the selective precipitation (SP) process was performed using AMD discharged from a currently operating mine in Korea for the purpose of minimizing the environmental impact of AMD. For the SP process, a pilot scale equipment (100 L reaction tank) was used in field and among various metals, Cu and Zn were the target metals. Through the research, it was confirmed that AMD from an operating mine has two disadvantages of being applied to the SP: altering water quality and unexpected inclusion of clay debris. Despite unfavorable conditions, Cu and Zn precipitate of 80% purity with 90% precipitation rate was able to be obtained from 1.4 L/min (2.0 tons/day) AMD. The recovered precipitates were identified as amorphous CuS and ZnS with small amounts of impurities (Si minerals, CuFeS2, and Fe/Al hydroxide). The strategies to reduce these impurities were also discussed. Recovery rate, which is the amount of precipitate collected per unit volume of AMD, was proposed as an indicator to evaluate the working efficiency of the SP process. It was confirmed that the recovery rate was strongly dependent on flow rate and dose of coagulant. The results of this study may be helpful in reducing the potential complications which occurs when SP is applied on field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the spring and fall of 2001 and the spring of 2002 a study was conducted to evaluate the health of the largescale stoneroller (Campostoma oligolepis) populations in streams along an urban land-use gradient. Sites were selected from a pool of naturally similar sub-basins (eco-region, basin size, and geology) of the Mobile River basin (MRB), using an index of urban intensity derived from infrastructure, socioeconomic, and land-use data. This urban land-use gradient (ULUG) is a multimetric indicator of urban intensity, ranging from 0 (background) to 100 (intense urbanization). Campostoma sp. have been used previously as indicators of stream health and are common species found in all sites within the MRB. Endpoints used to determine the effects of urban land-use on the largescale stoneroller included total glutathione, histology, hepatic apoptosis, condition factor and external lesions. Liver glutathione levels were positively associated with increasing urban land-use (r(2) = 0.94). Histopathological examination determined that some abnormalities and lesions were correlated with the ULUG and generally increased in prevalence or severity with increasing urbanization. Liver macrophage aggregates were positively correlated to the ULUG. The occurrence of nucleosomal ladders (indicating apoptotic cell death) did not correspond with urban intensity in a linear fashion. Apoptosis, as well as prevalence and severity of a myxozoan parasite, appeared to have a hormetic dose-response relationship. The majority of the biomarkers suggested fish health was compromised in areas where the ULUG a parts per thousand yen 36.

AB  - This work aimed at characterizing the metabolome of the isopod Porcellionides pruinosus and at assessing its variations over 14 days under laboratory culture conditions and upon exposure to the contaminant metal Nickel (Ni). The spectral profiles obtained by H-1 NMR spectroscopy were thoroughly assigned and subjected to multivariate analysis in order to highlight consistent changes. Over 50 metabolites could be identified, providing considerable new knowledge on the metabolome of these model organisms. Several metabolites changed non-linearly with Ni dose and exposure time, showing distinct variation patterns for initial (4 days) and later time points (7 and 14 days). In particular, at day 4, several amino acids were increased and sugars were decreased (compared to controls), whereas these variations were inverted for longer exposure, possibly reflecting earlier and more intensive moulting. Other variations, namely in betaines and choline-containing compounds, were suggested to relate with osmoregulation and detoxification mechanisms. Ni also had a marked effect on several nucleotides (increased upon exposure) and a moderate impact on lipids (decreased upon exposure). Overall, this study has provided new information on the Ni-induced metabolic adaptations of the P. pruinosus isopod, paving the way for improved mechanistic understanding of how these model organisms handle soil contamination.
   Significance: This study provided, for the first time to our knowledge, a detailed picture of the NMR-detectable metabolome of terrestrial isopods and of its fluctuations in time and upon exposure to the contaminant metal Nickel. Several time- and dose-dependent changes were highlighted, providing mechanistic insight into how these important model organisms handle Ni contamination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Engineering cells to produce valuable metabolic products is hindered by the slow and laborious methods available for evaluating product concentration. Consequently, many designs go unevaluated, and the dynamics of product formation over time go unobserved. In this work, we develop a framework for observing product formation in real time without the need for sample preparation or laborious analytical methods. We use genetically encoded biosensors derived from small-molecule responsive transcription factors to provide a fluorescent readout that is proportional to the intracellular concentration of a target metabolite. Combining an appropriate biosensor with cells designed to produce a metabolic product allows us to track product formation by observing fluorescence. With individual cells exhibiting fluorescent intensities proportional to the amount of metabolite they produce, high-throughput methods can be used to rank the quality of genetic variants or production conditions. We observe production of several renewable plastic precursors with fluorescent readouts and demonstrate that higher fluorescence is indeed an indicator of higher product titer. Using fluorescence as a guide, we identify process parameters that produce 3-hydroxypropionate at 4.2 g/L, 23-fold higher than previously reported. We also report, to our knowledge, the first engineered route from glucose to acrylate, a plastic precursor with global sales of $14 billion. Finally, we monitor the production of glucarate, a replacement for environmentally damaging detergents, and muconate, a renewable precursor to polyethylene terephthalate and nylon with combined markets of $51 billion, in real time, demonstrating that our method is applicable to a wide range of molecules.

AB  - Due to the lack of an efficient cultivation system, little is known about the stability and inactivation of hepatitis E virus (HEV). In addition, there is a lack of information on which cultivable virus(es) are suitable as model or surrogate viruses for HEV. Murine norovirus (MNV) and F-RNA coliphage MS2 are potential surrogates and F-RNA coliphages are a potential indicator for enteric viruses. However, the numbers of F-RNA coliphages excreted by swine are relatively low. In contrast, Porcine teschovirus (PTV) is cultivable and is excreted abundantly. PTV is readily detected on swine carcasses and the potential of PTV as a viral indicator of fecal contamination on hog carcasses is currently being explored, however, there is no information on the environmental stability of PTV. The survival of PTV was determined on vacuum packaged pork chops during storage at 2 degrees C using cultivation and molecular techniques and compared to published data on the survival of MNV and MS2 under similar conditions. Viable PTV was reduced by >= 1.8 log units compared to a reduction of 0.6 log genomic copies after 7 weeks. The viability data indicates that PTV is less stable than MS2 and MNV during storage at 2 degrees C whereas similar reductions in genomic copies were observed for all 3 viruses. This study provides data on the survival of PTV on pork and insight on the potential of PTV as a surrogate for HEV in the pork processing chain. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier BY.

AB  - Inspired by the functional behavior of the biological nervous system of the human brain, the artificial neural network (ANN) has found many applications as a superior tool to model complex, dynamic, highly nonlinear, and ill-defined scientific and engineering problems. For this reason, ANNs are employed extensively in drying applications because of their favorable characteristics, such as efficiency, generalization, and simplicity. This article presents a comprehensive review of numerous significant applications of the ANN technique to solve problems of nonlinear function approximation, pattern detection, data interpretation, optimization, simulation, diagnosis, control, data sorting, clustering, and noise reduction in drying technology. We summarize the use of the ANN approach in modeling various dehydration methods; e.g., batch convective thin-layer drying, fluidized bed drying, osmotic dehydration, osmotic-convective drying, infrared, microwave, infrared- and microwave-assisted drying processes, spray drying, freeze drying, rotary drying, renewable drying, deep bed drying, spout bed drying, industrial drying, and several miscellaneous applications. Generally, ANNs have been used in drying technology for modeling, predicting, and optimization of heat and mass transfer, thermodynamic performance parameters, and quality indicators as well as physiochemical properties of dried products. Moreover, a limited number of researchers have focused on control of drying systems to achieve desired product quality by online manipulating of the drying conditions using previously trained ANNs. Opportunities and limitations of the ANN technique for drying process simulation, optimization, and control are outlined to guide future R&D in this area.

AB  - Lindera melissifolia is a federally endangered endemic shrub of the southeastern United States. Numerous populations are gender-biased. The goal of this study was to determine environmental conditions most appropriate for establishment and growth of seedlings and adult females. Seedlings were grown under varied moisture and light to compare growth rates and morphological ratios. Seedlings were clipped to simulate two levels of disturbance, and their shoot sprouting ability was assessed. Densities of adult flowering stems, co-occurring species, and solar transmittance were analyzed within two North Carolina populations. The lowest levels of light resulted in decreased growth, but light and moisture did not interact to affect seedling growth rate significantly. Morphological ratios and growth responses followed patterns expected for plants exhibiting plasticity in response to varied light levels, but not to moisture. Clipping immature plants below root collars decreased survivorship to 31%. Growth rates of new shoots when clipped below and above the root collar were 40% and 58% percent lower, respectively (p < 0.001). Percent cover of Lindera melissifolia explained 52% of the variation in the number of male flowering stems per plot and 14% of the variation in female stems per plot. No relation of stem density to percent transmittance was found. Indicator species analysis revealed association of males with facultative wetland species and a weak association of females with wetland obligates, but overall difference in vegetation composition between plots with or without females present was slight (MRPP: A = 0.02, p = 0.016). We concluded hydrology should be a primary concern for future studies.

AB  - In racing Thoroughbred horses, blood cell counts and key biochemistry parameters are used to monitor horse health during training. The most common measure is total white blood cell (WBC) count, usually coupled with estimates of the relative abundance of the five main types of WBC. However, WBC can go down and up when challenged, making interpretation difficult. In contrast, a large majority of health issues that impact training should trigger an inflammatory response. In this study, we test the potential for two inflammatory biomarkers, fibrinogen and serum amyloid A (SAA), to provide more reliable indicators of health issues across a large sample of horses in training. We find that although WBC and other cell counts are generally correlated with each other and other biochemistry parameters across their full range of values, fibrinogen and SAA exhibit the greatest concordance among the top 15% of values. Moreover, horses with the top WBC values do not overlap significantly with those having the top fibrinogen and SAA values. Because most horses are healthy, these patterns suggest that natural variation in cell counts and biochemistry largely occlude values that might indicate health issues. In contrast, the subset of unusual horses with elevated levels of both fibrinogen and SAA are strongly suggestive of the expected handful of animals with minor, undetected issues. We conclude that fibrinogen and SAA have excellent potential as biomarkers and are likely to be more informative about conditions relevant to horses in training compared with the widely used WBC.

AB  - Red algae sometimes turn yellow, but few studies have been conducted on the yellowing of subtidal bed-forming species and on the relationship between the color and environmental factors. We examined the seasonal changes in thallus color of macroscopic subtidal red algae and nutrient levels as in shallow waters at two sites: Hirasawa (0 to 3 m in depth) and Okinoshima Island (0 to 6 m in depth), central Pacific coast of Japan from April 2011 to March 2012. Yellowed red algae were found at all depths of the two sites. At Hirasawa, the ratio of yellowed species among the red algae (yellowing ratio, YR) calculated with data on a total of 23 species (3 to 14 species month(-1)) was high in months in which nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) was low (1.73 to 2.19 mu mol L-1); in months with higher NO3-N (5.91 to 6.01 mu mol L-1), YR was 0 but exceptionally high in April probably because of the duration of fine days. At Okinoshima Island, YR calculated with data on a total of 40 species (3 to 22 species month(-1)) was high from March to July (except May), in which NO3-N was low (0.93 to 2.16 mu mol L-1), but low from October to February among the months with higher NO3-N (4.56 to 5.62 mu mol L-1). Totally, YR was negatively correlated with nitrate concentrations and NO3-N, which supports the possibility to use the value of YR as an indicator of nitrogen level although attention should also be paid to light conditions.

AB  - Escherichia coli and enterococci have been previously reported to differ in the mechanisms and conditions that affect their sunlight-mediated inactivation in waste stabilization ponds. This study was undertaken to further characterize these mechanisms, using simulated sunlight and single strains of laboratory-grown E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis, with a focus on characterizing the contribution of exogenous reactive oxygen species to the inactivation process. We found that direct damage by UVB light (280-320 nm) was not a significant inactivation mechanism for either organism. E. coli inactivation was strongly dependent on dissolved oxygen concentrations and the presence of UVB wavelengths but E. coli were not susceptible to inactivation by exogenous sensitizers present in waste stabilization pond water. In contrast, E. faecalis inactivation in pond water occurred primarily through exogenous mechanisms, with strong evidence that singlet oxygen is an important transient reactive species. The exogenous mechanism could utilize wavelengths into the visible spectrum and sensitizers were mainly colloidal, distributed between 0.2 and similar to 1 mu m in size. Singlet oxygen is likely an important endogenous species in both E. faecalis and E. coli inactivation due to sunlight. Although the two organisms had similar inactivation rates in buffered, clear water, the inactivation rate of E. faecalis was 7 times greater than that of E. coli in air-saturated pond water at circumneutral pH due to its susceptibility to exogenous sensitizers and longer wavelengths.

AB  - To ensure the safety of compost products, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment's compost guidelines specify upper limits for certain pathogenic and indicator microbes, which are presumably achieved by exposing every particle of compost to temperatures >= 55 degrees C for at least three consecutive days. A rugged temperature probe that behaves like a random compost particle was used to investigate whether every compost particle meets the time temperature criterion and to measure sanitation efficacy. An inoculum consisting of Salmonella enterica var. Meleagridis, Escherichia coli K12, and phi-S1 bacteriophage (all at levels of similar to 1 x 10(6) CFU/PFU mL(-1)) was added into 17 probes. The probes were randomly introduced into a covered, aerated static pile along with 17 probes that only monitored the temperature. After 56 days of composting, with one pile turn the probes were recovered. Organism levels were determined via culture-based methods. Before turning, 80% of the randomly introduced probes satisfied the time-temperature criterion. After turning, this number increased to 87%, demonstrating that turning is somewhat useful for sanitation. The cool zones largely remained mesophilic with the pile turning having minimal impact, which could potentially be an indication that the pile was not turned thoroughly. One of the 17 probes with cryovials reached only 40.2 degrees C, and survival of S. meleagridis (2.5 x 10(6) CFU ml(-1)) was observed. The remaining probes with cryovials exceeded 55 degrees C and were pathogen free. It appears that the specified time-temperature conditions are likely adequate. However, more observations are needed before a firm conclusion can be made.

AB  - Remote sensing can provide good alternatives for traditional in situ water status measurements in orchard crops, such as stem water potential (Psi(stem)). However, the heterogeneity of these cropping systems causes significant differences with regards to remote sensing products within one orchard and between orchards. In this study, robust spectral indicators of Psi(stem) were sought after, independent of sensor viewing geometry, orchard architecture and management. To this end, Psi(stem) was monitored throughout three consecutive growing seasons in (deficit) irrigated and rainfed pear orchards and related to spectral observations of leaves, canopies and WorldView-2 imagery. On a leaf and canopy level, high correlations were observed between the shortwave infrared reflectance and in situ measured Psi(stem). Additionally, for canopy measurements, visible and near-infrared wavelengths (R-530/R-600, R-530/R-700 and R-720/R-800) showed significant correlations. Therefore, the Red-edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ReNDVI) was applied on fully sunlit satellite imagery and found strongly related with Psi(stem) (R-2 = 0.47; RMSE = 0.36 MPa), undoubtedly showing the potential of WorldView-2 to monitor water stress in pear orchards. The relationship between ReNDVI and Psi(stem) was independent of management, irrigation setup, phenology and environmental conditions. In addition, results showed that this relation was also independent of off-nadir viewing angle and almost independent of viewing geometry, as the correlation decreased after the inclusion of fully shaded scenes. With further research focusing on issues related to viewing geometry and shadows, high spatial water status monitoring with space borne remote sensing is achievable.

AB  - Tree-ring chronologies are important indicators of pre-instrumental, natural climate variability. Some of the longest chronologies are from northern Fennoscandia, where ring width measurement series from living trees are combined with series from sub-fossil trees, preserved in shallow lakes, to form millennial-length records. We here assess the recent ends of such timeseries by comparing climate signals and growth characteristics in central and northern Sweden, of (1) trees growing at lakeshore micro-sites (representing the source of sub-fossil material of supra-long chronologies), with (2) trees collected in dryer micro-sites several meters "inland". Calibration trials reveal a predominating June-September temperature signal in N-Sweden and a weaker but significant May-September precipitation signal in C-Sweden. At the micro-site level, the temperature signal in N-Sweden is stronger in the lakeshore trees compared to the inland trees, whereas the precipitation signal in C-Sweden remains unchanged among the lakeshore and inland trees. Tree-rings at cambial ages > 40 years are also substantially wider in the lakeshore micro-site in C-Sweden, and juvenile rings are more variable (and wider) in the dryer micro-site in N-Sweden (compared to the adjacent micro-sites). By combining the data of the various micro-sites with relict samples spanning the past 1,000 years, we demonstrate that growth rate differences at the micro-site scale can affect the low frequency trends of millennial-length chronologies. For the supra-long chronologies from northern Fennoscandia, that are derived from sub-fossil lake material, it is recommended to combine these data with measurement series from only lakeshore trees.

AB  - Transgenerational effects of stressors can have important implications for offspring fitness and the responses of offspring to future stressful conditions. Parental effects, a common type of transgenerational effect, are non-genetic influences on offspring phenotype that result from parental phenotypes or environments. Little is known, however, about how parental exposure to a stressor effects offspring responses to other stressors despite this type of multi-stressor scenario being common. To better understand the role that parental effects have on offspring contaminant tolerance, we raised freshwater snails, Biomphalaria glabrata, in the presence or absence of predator threat (crayfish + crushed snail) for 12 weeks. Predators are common stressors in aquatic systems and can co-occur with chemical contaminants. We then collected egg masses from parental snails and exposed their offspring to cadmium and malathion survival challenges. Snails raised in the presence of predator threat displayed indicators of stress, including increased time to first reproduction, lower production of egg masses per snail per day and fewer eggs per egg mass, and had smaller shell lengths at 6.5 weeks old compared to snails not exposed to predator threat. Parental exposure to predator threat increased the cadmium tolerance of offspring but did not affect malathion tolerance. These results may have important implications for understanding effects of multiple stressors and indicate that the parental environment can influence responses to contaminants in offspring. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a biotic stressor in the parental environment can significantly affect the contaminant tolerance of their offspring.

AB  - Hematocrits were measured in Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) (n = 75) that were exposed to oil from a spill in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA, in 2003, and that laid eggs 17-39 days following the spill. Comparative data were obtained in three pre- and two post-spill years and from three unoiled reference sites. In non-spill years, annual means of hematocrit varied in parallel with breeding performance. Hematocrits were lower (mean 45.3, n = 75) and more variable in the oil spill year than in non-spill years, and 20% of birds sampled were anemic (hematocrit < 41.7). However, hematocrits were almost as low (mean 46.4, n = 44) in 2002, a year with naturally adverse conditions. In 2002, hematocrits and body-masses were depressed following two storms and recovered in parallel following the storms; hematocrits were positively correlated with body-mass and ambient temperature and negatively correlated with wind speed. In contrast, in 2003 hematocrits were negatively correlated with body-mass and temperature and positively correlated with wind speed. Hematocrits were very low (mean 39.8, n = 15) when birds were first sampled 20-23 days after the spill and recovered toward normal levels by day 39 (mean 49.4, n = 14). Reduced hematocrits can be a useful indicator of sublethal oil intoxication, especially in females, provided that they are not associated with low body-masses or adverse weather. Measuring hematocrits could be useful for rapid screening of populations sublethally exposed to oil. Received 4 April 2011, accepted 11 January 2013.

AB  - Despite the increasing agricultural use of biochar as a way of combining the utilization of biomass for energy production with the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, it is not known how variations in pyrolysis temperature and feedstock type affect concentration and composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that inevitably form and associate with biochar. To close this knowledge gap, we quantified 11 unsubstituted three- to five-ring PAHs as well as alkylated forms of phenanthrene and anthracene in grass and wood chars produced in 100 degrees C increments across a temperature range (100 to 700 degrees C). Our results show that solvent-extractable PAH concentrations in biochars produced at heat treatment temperatures (HTTs) of 400 and 500 degrees C greatly exceed those observed at higher and lower temperature, supporting a low HTT solid-phase formation mechanism operable at temperatures commonly used for industrial biochar production. The maximum extractable yield of 'pyrolytic' unsubstituted PAHs for grass (22 mu g g(-1) at HT'T = 500 degrees C) greatly exceeds the value for wood (5.9 mu g g(-1)). Moreover, PAH signatures (e.g., total monomethylphenanthrene to phenanthrene ratios, MP/P similar to 2-3) at intermediate temperatures (400 degrees C) resemble those of fossil oils rather than that commonly attributed to pyrolytic products. Further research is needed to characterize the PAR evolution in modern pyrolysis reactors and assess the fate of biochar-bound PAHs in soils and sediments. Various commonly applied PAR ratios and indicator compounds show promise as markers for specific feedstock materials and pyrolysis conditions of biochars in environmental systems.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as fundamental regulators that silence gene expression at the post-transcriptional and translational levels. The identification of their targets is a major challenge to elucidate the regulated biological processes. The overall effect of miRNA is reflected on target mRNA expression, suggesting the design of new investigative methods based on high-throughput experimental data such as miRNA and transcriptome profiles. We propose a novel statistical measure of non-linear dependence between miRNA and mRNA expression, in order to infer miRNA-target interactions. This approach, which we name antagonism pattern detection, is based on the statistical recognition of a triangular-shaped pattern in miRNA-target expression profiles. This pattern is observed in miRNA-target expression measurements since their simultaneously elevated expression is statistically under-represented in the case of miRNA silencing effect. The proposed method enables miRNA target prediction to strongly rely on cellular context and physiological conditions reflected by expression data. The procedure has been assessed on synthetic datasets and tested on a set of real positive controls. Then it has been applied to analyze expression data from Ewing's sarcoma patients. The antagonism relationship is evaluated as a good indicator of real miRNA-target biological interaction. The predicted targets are consistently enriched for miRNA binding site motifs in their 3'UTR. Moreover, we reveal sets of predicted targets for each miRNA sharing important biological function. The procedure allows us to infer crucial miRNA regulators and their potential targets in Ewing's sarcoma disease. It can be considered as a valid statistical approach to discover new insights in the miRNA regulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Understanding factors that influence persistence of influenza virus in an environment without host animals is critical to appropriate decision-making for issues such as quarantine downtimes, setback distances, and eradication programs in livestock production systems. This systematic review identifies literature describing persistence of influenza virus in environmental samples, i.e., air, water, soil, feces, and fomites. An electronic search of PubMed, CAB, AGRICOLA, Biosis, and Compendex was performed, and citation relevance was determined according to the aim of the review. Quality assessment of relevant studies was performed using criteria from experts in virology, disease ecology, and environmental science. A total of 9,760 abstracts were evaluated, and 40 appeared to report the persistence of influenza virus in environmental samples. Evaluation of full texts revealed that 19 of the 40 studies were suitable for review, as they described virus concentration measured at multiple sampling times, with viruses detectable at least twice. Seven studies reported persistence in air (six published before 1970), seven in water (five published after 1990), two in feces, and three on surfaces. All three fomite and five air studies addressed human influenza virus, and all water and feces studies pertained to avian influenza virus. Outcome measurements were transformed to half-lives, and resultant multivariate mixed linear regression models identified influenza virus surviving longer in water than in air. Temperature was a significant predictor of persistence over all matrices. Salinity and pH were significant predictors of persistence in water conditions. An assessment of the methodological quality review of the included studies revealed significant gaps in reporting critical aspects of study design.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to provide a longitudinal evaluation of the effects of physical enrichments on the behaviour and physiology of intensive stock-farming pigs. Twenty-eight crossbred pigs of both sexes, were exposed to four types of enrichments (hemp ropes, steel chains, plastic balls, rubber hoses) over a period of eleven weeks. This investigation was based on specific abnormal behaviours and physiological indicators, including hematologic parameters. For behavioural score, focal sampling was used with recording of abnormal behaviours (body-, tail- and ear-biting), belly nosing, running, and interaction with objects (for Enriched pigs). The presence of skin injuries was also recorded. In general, the frequency of abnormal behaviours was significantly reduced in the Enriched group. A time-related profile appeared in the use of the enrichments. Males showed higher occurrence of skin injuries than females. Physiological measurements, such as levels of complement system, white blood cells and neutrophils, were lower in pigs from the Enriched group. Enriched pigs, as a whole, presented much lower levels of serum DHEA-S concentration over two weeks. The findings of this study show the successful provision of appropriate enrichments to encourage behaviours which may result in satisfactory animal oral interaction with the enriching objects, preventing them biting pen-mates. In this respect, the objects proposed were strongly effective in producing changes in behaviour which could mitigate inadequate conditions, such as the relationship between animal body weight and the available space allowance.

AB  - Pyrite framboids occur in loose blocks of plant-bearing clastic rocks related to volcano-sedimentary succession of the Mount Wawel Formation (Eocene) in the Dragon and Wanda glaciers area at Admiralty Bay, King George Island, West Antarctica. They were investigated by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and isotopic analysis of pyritic sulphur. The results suggest that the pyrite formed as a result of production of hydrogen sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria in near surface sedimentary environments. Strongly negative delta(34)S(VCDT) values of pyrite (-30 -25 parts per thousand) support its bacterial origin. Perfect shapes of framboids resulted from their growth in the open pore space of clastic sediments. The abundance of framboids at certain sedimentary levels and the lack or negligible content of euhedral pyrite suggest pulses of high supersaturation with respect to iron monosulphides. The dominance of framboids of small sizes (8-16 mu m) and their homogeneous distribution at these levels point to recurrent development of a laterally continuous anoxic sulphidic zone below the sediment surface. Sedimentary environments of the Mount Wawel Formation developed on islands of the young magmatic arc in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region. They embraced stagnant and flowing water masses and swamps located in valleys, depressions, and coastal areas that were covered by dense vegetation. Extensive deposition and diagenesis of plant detritus in these environments promoted anoxic conditions in the sediments, and a supply of marine and/or volcanogenic sulphate enabled its bacterial reduction, precipitation of iron monosulphides, and their transformation to pyrite framboids.

AB  - Plant and therefore food and feed production require an adequate supply of nutrients. Efficient nutrient use is a major task to ensure economically and environmentally sound food production minimizing the impact of nutrients on ground water, the risk of eutrophication caused by rising nutrient concentrations in surface waters and the emission of trace gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3). Agri-environmental indicators (AEI) developed by the OECD shall identify and quantify the extent of impacts by agricultural management on the environment and track the effects of policy measures. Nutrient balances for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on the national level are two of these agri-environmental indicators used by the OECD to compare member states and draw conclusions about nutrient loads from agriculture into the environment.
   OECD member states are required to calculate and provide gross soil surface nutrient balances for N and P on an annual base. The German N gross soil surface balance for the time period from 1992 to 2006 shows a surplus between 89 and 121 kg ha(-1) a(-1) N. Because nutrient balances are simplifications of complex and variable processes they comprise a series of uncertainties. These uncertainties are mainly associated with either the statistical data base or the coefficient library used to convert the statistical data into nutrient quantities. Therefore, it is essential to be aware that the absolute balance values do not reflect the actual situation in a country. Nevertheless, in case that a consistent method of balance calculation is used for all years a comparison between these years to derive trends in nutrient surpluses or deficits is possible.

AB  - Female-limited colour polymorphisms occur in a variety of species, where often one female morph (androchrome) resembles the body coloration of the conspecific male, whereas the other (gynochrome) does not. We tested predictions of two frequency-dependent hypotheses that are commonly invoked to explain the maintenance of these polymorphisms for multiple populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans: (1) that males prefer mating with the most abundant female morph (LMR) or (2) that androchromes are functional male mimics (MM). We also asked whether variation in social and abiotic environments account for interpopulation variation in female morph frequencies. Contrary to predictions of the LMR hypothesis, morph mating frequency was not lower than expected based on morph frequency when a morph was uncommon or higher when a morph was most common. In support of the MM hypothesis, androchrome mating frequency was lower than predicted based on population morph frequency. In addition, as predicted, androchrome mating frequency increased with increasing ratio of androchromes to males, but we could not disentangle whether this was a consequence of the changing mimic/model ratio or because of rising androchrome frequency. Although variation in female morph frequencies between populations was not random across our study area, this could not be explained by geographical variation in frequencies and densities of males and females. Androchrome frequencies were higher in populations to the north and west where ambient temperatures were lower. Abiotic conditions such as temperature may need to be considered for understanding the maintenance of female-limited polymorphisms.

AB  - Previous field and laboratory studies have identified the alga Lobophora variegata as a good candidate for biomonitoring metal contamination in the New Caledonia lagoon which is subjected to intensive and extensive metal inputs from land-based mining activities. The aim of this work was to further assess the bioindicative potential of this species by investigating, in the field, its bioaccumulation capacity for local key contaminants, i.e. Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn. Algae from clean and contaminated sites were cross-transplanted for a period of three months in order to determine the in situ uptake and depuration kinetics of the nine elements. Results indicate that algae transplanted to the contaminated site displayed a significant linear increase in concentration with time for Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni. In contrast, algae transplanted to the clean site did not show major deputation of these elements, except for Co. Overall, L variegata showed a rapid temporal response in metal uptake, especially for the elements intensively released into the coastal environment of New Caledonia (viz,, Co, Cr, Mn and Ni). This species appears therefore as an excellent bioindicator species of metal contamination in this area. Our results also provide background information necessary for using L. variegata under in situ experimental conditions so as to provide better quantitative information on ambient metal contamination levels. The wide distribution of L. variegata in tropical areas further enhances its potential as a bioinclicator species of metal contamination in other tropical coastal environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study, acidic latex wastewater containing high average zinc and acetic contents of 816 mg L-1 and 20,862 mg COD L-1, respectively, was treated successfully by a series of chemical and biological processes without any addition of acid or base for pH adjustment. Total dissolved solids of the treated effluent increased by only 1.1-fold on average for sulfide precipitation as compared to 2.8-fold for the hydroxide strategy. The oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) value of 0 mV was used successfully as an indicator for optimum sulfide addition which consistently provided an appreciable reduction in effluent concentrations to less than 1 and 2 mg L-1 for zinc and residual sulfide, respectively. The anaerobic filter was very stable in handling the chemically treated wastewater up to the organic loading rate of 11.8 g COD L-1 day(-1) with an average efficiency of 92%. Methane production and biomass yield were 0.32L(gCOD(removed))(-1) and 0.014gVSS (gCOD(removed))(-1), respectively. For the activated sludge process, the optimum sludge age and hydraulic retention time were 30 and 0.8 days, respectively, which are equivalent to the organic loading rates of 2.50 g COD L-1 day(-1) or 2.13 g BOD L-1 day(-1). Under these optimum conditions, average removal efficiencies for COD and BOD were 96.6 and 99.4%. Average soluble COD, BOD and suspended solids in the effluent were 71, 11 and 38 mg L-1, respectively. This integrated treatment scheme was proven to be an effective approach for highly polluted and toxic rubber thread wastewater. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diatoms were examined in twelve ponds and four small lakes of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, to assess their biodiversity, response to environmental conditions and potential use as bioindicators for water quality. They were investigated from different substrates and relationships with water chemistry and habitat character were assessed. In total 212 diatom species were found with 98 taxa at relative abundances > 1 %. The most species-rich genera were Navicula (42), Gomphonema (39), Achnanthes sensu lato (27), Nitzschia (27) and Fragilaria sensu lato (20). Species diversity was low (mean 0.95 +/- 0.17 sd) and most assemblages were dominated by 1-3 taxa. Thirty percent of the taxa found could not be identified using relevant literature. Species richness, diversity and evenness were not related to water chemistry or habitat character, but varied significantly on different substrate types and were higher in the sediment compared to stones and macrophytes. At five of seven sites, where several substrates were collected, the most abundant species occurred on all substrates. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that changes in species composition were most strongly correlated with gradients in water chemistry. Achnanthidium minutissimum was characteristic at sites with higher Ca concentrations, while Eolimna minima, Nitzschia palea, Nitzschia palea cf. var. debilis and Gomphonema parvulum indicated higher concentrations of K, Cl, Na, As, Ni, Fe and Al. E minima and N. palea were also typical at sites with higher concentration of SO42-, Sr and Al. Assemblage composition was also significantly correlated with habitat character such as aquatic vegetation, substrate composition, bank character and land use.

AB  - The Northwest Forest Plan's 1994 Record of Decision (ROD) established a framework for a new ecosystem approach to federal land management across 24 million acres of the Pacific Northwest. One strategy outlined in the ROD combined ecosystem management and civic involvement in the creation of planning provinces, consisting of 12 contiguous multi-ownership areas spanning the Plan region. The ROD also directed agencies to monitor the effectiveness of the Plan, including the implementation of a socioeconomic monitoring program. We defined communities within provinces in order to better understand socioeconomic change. We developed a composite measure of community socioeconomic well-being (SEWB) to compare communities within the 12 planning provinces based on their proximity to Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands. Some provinces improved in SEWB over the decade and some declined, but this was not related to how much FS and BLM lands were in the province, nor how many communities in the province were close to FS and BLM lands. Communities within 5 miles of FS and BLM lands had significantly lower SEWB scores compared to communities farther away in both 1990 and 2000. Income inequality increased significantly between 1990 and 2000 for communities within 5 miles of FS and BLM lands but showed no significant change for communities farther away. As existing jurisdictions that span multiple land ownerships with mechanisms for dialogue and learning among stakeholders and decisionmakers, planning provinces provide opportunities for increased understanding of the ways that forest management affects to community socioeconomic well-being. Information on socioeconomic conditions of communities in planning provinces is an important step in understanding how communities change and what factors contribute to change.

AB  - The existence of surface guided electromagnetic waves has been theoretically predicted from Maxwell's equations and investigated during the first decades of the 20(th) century. However, it is only since the late 1960's that they have attracted the interest of surface physicists and earned the moniker of "surface plasmon". With the advent of commercially available instruments and well established theories, the technique has been used to study a wide variety of biochemical and biotechnological phenomena. Spectral response of the resonance condition serves as a sensitive indicator of the optical properties of thin films immobilized within a wavelength of the surface. This enhanced surface sensitivity has provided a boon to the surface sciences, and fosters collaboration between surface chemistry, physics and the ongoing biological and biotechnological revolution. Since then, techniques based on surface plasmons such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), SPR Imaging, Plasmon Waveguide Resonance (PWR) and others, have been increasingly used to determine the affinity and kinetics of a wide variety of real time molecular interactions such as protein-protein, lipid-protein and ligand-protein, without the need for a molecular tag or label. The physical-chemical methodologies used to immobilize membranes at the surface of these optical devices are reviewed, pointing out advantages and limitations of each method. The paper serves to summarize both historical and more recent developments of these technologies for investigating structure-function aspects of these molecular interactions, and regulation of specific events in signal transduction by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).

AB  - Nutrient manipulation experiments were conducted on a natural planktonic community in outdoor mesocosms. Inorganic nitrogen (N) and silicon (Si) were added to achieve N: Si ratios of 1 : 1 and 4: 1. Total particulate carbon (PC) biomass of the microbial assemblage was determined by elemental analysis. Cell volume measurements by microscope on individual components of the community (bacteria, diatoms. photosynthetic nanoflagellates, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, dinoflagellates and ciliates) were also made. We applied published C: volume relationships to determine the volume estimated C content (CBV) of these microbial groups and hence of the total assemblage. The total CBV and total PC were compared to test the applicability of C: volume relationships under different nutrient regimes both before and after nutrient exhaustion. For initial N: Si ratios of 1 : 1. prior to nutrient exhaustion. the relationship between CBV and PC was linear with a gradient of approximately 1. (0.99+/-0.06). indicating that the published C:,volume relationships accurately predicted the C content of the microbial assemblage. For N:Si ratios of 4: 1. a linear relationship was again evident between CBV and PC (slope: 1.36 +/- 0.08). However. statistical comparison using a general linear model indicated that the gradient of this relationship differed significantly from that when the N:Si ratio was 1 : 1, and hence CBV overestimated elemental C. For both N: Si ratios. subsequent to nutrient exhaustion (N or Si). and hence when the diatom fraction of the microbial assemblage was in yield-limited post-exponential phase. the two measures of biomass were not well correlated. This indicated that measured cytoplasmic cell volume was a poor indicator of C biomass within the microbial assemblage in nutrient-deplete conditions.

AB  - The National Drought Policy (NDP) was ratified by the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments in 1992. Its aims are to encourage primary producers and other sections of rural Australia to adopt self-reliant approaches to managing for climatic variability, to maintain and protect Australia's agricultural and environmental resource base during periods of extreme climatic stress, and to ensure early recovery of agricultural and rural industries. Science has had an integral role in the development and implementation of the NDP. This has included research aimed at improving the reliability of seasonal climate forecasts, and the management of climate variability per se. Aids to management include access to climate information, and climatic, agronomic, and financial decision support systems to assist in the management of risk. There have also been substantial advances in using remote sensing, agronomic models and geographic information systems to assist in the monitoring and assessment of drought. Severe drought conditions affected large areas of Australia in the early 1990s, particularly in 1994. It therefore became necessary to assess the impact of drought within districts to determine whether Drought Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) applied, this being the trigger for invoking financial assistance from the Commonwealth government. An objective, science-based framework was therefore developed as the basis for estimating the extent and severity of drought. A national research program identified key indicators of the severity of drought. This paper examines these developments from both a scientific and policy perspective, including the recent broadening of the basis for Commonwealth financial assistance to generalised Exceptional Circumstances. Opportunities for further research and development are discussed.

AB  - In this study we evaluate the performance of the Ensemble Transform (ET) technique, which is one of several targeting methods used in real time during the Fronts and Atlantic Storm-Track EXperiment (FASTEX). 'Targeted' observations were taken adaptively in those upstream areas identified in real time as most relevant for improving the initial conditions for forecasts of synoptic-scale storms developing downstream. The upstream areas were identified as regions where the effect of extra observations at a future analysis time could produce the largest decrease in the largest likely forecast error at a preselected later verification time at a given downstream location. The ET technique selects these observational areas out of a large number of possible deployment locations of observational resources via a linear transformation of an ensemble of forecasts.
   The analysis and forecast effects of special targeted observations associated with seven Intensive Observing Periods (IOPs) during FASTEX were investigated. The most important result of the present study is that the ET technique, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational global ensemble, was able to identify upstream areas that had significant contribution to the quality of selected future downstream forecast features. Moreover, the technique could reliably distinguish between the areas of greatest contribution.
   Through the overall impact of the targeted data on forecast quality is positive, there were cases when the extra data;degraded the forecasts. Our analysis indicates that large amplification of ensemble perturbations from the targeted area into the verification area is a good indicator of potential forecast improvement.

AB  - An attempt is made to understand the redox conditions that prevailed in the north eastern continental margins of the Arabian Sea and in the nearby deep water regions during the past few centuries using short undisturbed sediment cores. The geochronology is accomplished using Pb-210 excess method and the proxy indicators chosen for productivity and associated redox changes are CaCO3, organic matter (OM), Mn and U along with major elements Fe and Al. Such changes in principle are related to high productivity in the overlying waters which in turn depend on monsoonal intensity that causes upwelling responsible for increase in productivity. Alongwith the published data on gravity cores from the same region, our measurements suggest the following:
   At approximately 300 m water depth, south of 21-degrees-N, the sediment-water interface at depths of approximately 300 m had been anoxic during the time span represented by the presently studied cores for approximately approximately 700 y as evidenced by low Mn/Al (< 0.7 x 10(-2)) and high U/Al (> 10(-4)) weight ratios. In some adjacent deeper regions, however, the environment turned oxic around approximately 200 y BP. Whereas both Mn and Ra were lost to the overlying waters in the anoxic regions (depth approximately 340 m), the Mn that diffused from deeper sections appears to have mineralized at the sediment-water-interface. Studies of this type on long undisturbed cores from the margins of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, involving several proxies and geochronology by more than one method are needed to understand short term environmental (and monsoonal intensity) changes of the recent past with high resolution.

AB  - Studies of the photosynthetic assimilation of inorganic carbon by the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum showed that the aeration system has a major influence on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration and hence growth rates. The stable isotope ratio of C-13/C-12 was used as an indicator of carbon limitation. Three aeration systems were used. Algae from a well-aerated culture (2 dm min-1) had a specific growth rate of 1.58 d-1, reached a cell density of 12 x 10(6) cells cm-3, displayed a constant deltaC-13 value of -23.6 parts per thousand and the inorganic carbon concentration of the growth media remained above 1.5 mol m-3. Algae from non-aerated cultures had the lowest growth rate (0.42 d-1 after 4.5 d), were able to consume DIC faster than the resupply of atmospheric CO2, and the DIC concentration reached 0.68 mol m-3 after 6.5 d of culture. The deltaC-13 value of these algae rose to -17.83 parts per thousand. Algae that were poorly aerated (0.1 dm3 min-1) had intermediate growth rates (0.72 d-1 at 4.5 d) and reduced the DIC concentration to 0.17 mol m-3 after 6.5 d. Algae grown under these conditions displayed the highest deltaC-13 values, -12.3 parts per thousand. Aeration (2 dm3 min-1) of a previously unaerated culture restored the DIC concentration of the culture medium to 2.0 mol m-3 and reduced the deltaC-13 from -14.0 parts per thousand to -23.4 parts per thousand.

AB  - Worsening freshwater scarcity has heightened the need for treatment technologies capable of eliminating chemical and biological contaminants to allow for the beneficial use of traditionally underutilized water resources. In urbanized arid and semiarid regions such as California, urban drainage represents an increasingly important water source for augmenting water supply. However, monitoring shows that urban streams are contaminated ubiquitously with urban-use insecticides (e.g., pyrethroids and fipronil) that have broad-spectrum toxicity. In this study, a large open-water wetland pond (OWWP), characterized by shallow water depth and the absence of permanent vegetation, was evaluated for the removal of pyrethroids and fipronil (and its biologically active degradates). Concentration-based removal and changes in the pesticide mass flux were calculated to determine the efficacy of the OWWP. Toxic units for indicator aquatic invertebrates were estimated before and after the OWWP treatment to determine reductions in potential aquatic toxicity. Contaminant concentrations in water and sediment consistently decreased as the water was moving through the OWWP. Concentration-based removals were 44.2-100% for fipronil compounds, 61.8-100% for bifenthrin, and 47.3-92.7% for cyfluthrin, and the removal was attributed to sedimentation, in situ microbial degradation, and photolysis. The mitigation of these urban-use insecticides by the OWWP was similar to that of a densely vegetated constructed wetland at the same site. Therefore, OWWPs represent a low-maintenance and effective wetland configuration for large-scale water reclamation and may be particularly useful for arid and semiarid regions with favorable meteorological conditions (e.g., intense sunshine and high temperature).

AB  - We examined concentrations of organic carbon, dissolved sulfides, total sediment sulfur, and stable sulfur isotope ratios in seagrass leaf tissues across a nitrogen-enrichment gradient in a coastal marine ecosystem (Cape Cod, Massachusetts) in 2007-2010 and 2017-2019. We also measured seagrass aboveground and belowground biomass, epibiota biomass, and leaf chlorophyll content. Seagrasses were present at all sites in the former period but were lost at our most nitrogen-impacted site (Snug Harbor) by 2011. In 2007-2010, sediment organic carbon and dissolved sulfides were highest in Snug Harbor and decreased along the gradient; leaf tissues depleted in S-34 also indicated higher sulfide intrusion into seagrass tissues in more eutrophic areas. By 2017-2019, sediment organic carbon and pore-water soluble sulfides had decreased in Snug Harbor, but had increased at the intermediate site, to levels found at the most impacted site prior to the seagrass die-off. Again, leaf tissue S-34 depletion reflected this pattern, indicating seagrasses were exposed to the highest sulfides at the intermediate site. The decreases in sediment organic carbon and soluble sulfides in Snug Harbor years after the loss of the seagrasses illustrate a feedback between high organic matter in seagrass beds and increasing stressors like elevated soluble sulfides in nutrient-enriched systems. We found significant relationships between sediment conditions and seagrass responses, including greater aboveground to belowground biomass ratios, epibiota biomass, and S-34-depleted leaves at sites with high pore-water sulfide and highly organic sediments. Our research suggests that the reduction of anthropogenic nitrogen entering the harbor is necessary for improving sediment quality and preventing seagrass mortality.

AB  - Triclosan is a widely used biocide against microorganisms and is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Triclosan can be accumulated into plants from soil and hydroponic media. However, little information is currently available on the comparative fate of triclosan in plants under soil and hydroponics cultivation conditions and factors governing uptake. Therefore, this study was designed to comparatively elucidate the uptake mechanism of C-14-triclosan in youdonger (Brassica campestris subsp. Chinensis var. communis) grown under different soils and hydroponics and clarify dominant uptake factors. Results showed that 77.2% of C-14 were accumulated in youdonger grown in a hydroponic system, while only 1.24%-2.33% were accumulated in the two soil-planting systems. In addition, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of C-14-triclosan in soil-plant systems was approximately 400-fold smaller than that in the hydroponics. In the soil-planting system, a strong linear correlation was found between concentrations of triclosan in soil pore water and youdonger plant (R-2 0.85, p < 0.01) at different incubation times. Therefore, triclosan in pore water might be a good indicator to estimate its accumulation in plants and is significantly affected by soil pH, clay, and organic matter contents. The estimated average dietary intakes of triclosan for youdonger grown in hydroponic and soil-planting systems were estimated to be 1.31 ng day(-1) kg(-1) and 0.05-0.12 ng day(-1) kg(-1), respectively, much lower than the acceptable dietary intakes of triclosan (83 mu g day(-1) kg(-1)), indicating no significant human health risks from youdonger

AB  - The problem of development of cadastral assessment modeling by using the methods of correlation and regression analysis is still on the top because of different reasons. One of that reasons is the difficulty to choose reasonable price forming factors of land market cost for the conditions of active small market settlements in municipal areas. For a population of settlements combined in one valuation group, it also remains a challenge to develop a cadastral assessment model that takes into account parameters that are not only related to their geolocation, physical, technical and operational characteristics, but can also take into account the influence of the social-economic environment on the modelled value of valued objects, which would subsequently reduce the probability of errors and the number of cases of disputed cadastral values. In this research reviewed price peculiarities of the real estate market of settlements were considered, their grouping was carried out and possibilities of application of social-economic factors were analyzed that allow reducing errors in construction of the cadastral value model of land. The correlation-regression method is applied to choose pricing factors, the coefficients of pair correlation and the index of their comparative importance are determined, and their multicollinearity is checked up. The study also shows that the set of specific socioeconomic factors is non-permanent and depends on the changes in macroeconomic situation. As applied to the Krasnodar region in 2020 the indicators of the level of development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the number of resident population became the significant factors for the model of calculation of the cadastral value of land for the formed groups of settlements in the municipal districts.

However, when functional morphology is invoked on an ad hoc basis there exists a risk of circular reasoning. Performance spaces/landscapes constructed using biomechanical experiments can be used to tie performance to morphology quantitatively. They can be used to estimate fitness and function in specific environments by allowing multiple specific measures of function to be evaluated simultaneously. Absolute performance can be used to constrain palaeoenvironmental interpretations by detecting functional limits. We constructed a performance space with four variables (transport resistance, settling time, settling orientation and respiration potential) relating to hydrodynamic and metabolic variables. We combine new performance data with existing palaeoenvironmental interpretations and associated distributions of brachiopods of the suborder Productidina during the late Carboniferous and early Permian in the North American Midcontinent. Productidines were chosen because they lacked pedicles and relied on body and spine morphology to interact with their environment. Offshore dysoxia-associated taxa had increased resistance to sinking and proportionally larger lophophores, potentially improving survivorship in low-oxygen, soft substrate environments. Taxa associated with nearshore and oxygenated offshore environments display a range in performance consistent with a range of conditions, but all had proportionally smaller lophophores. Models that are less stable in high-velocity flows consistently settle in the correct convex down orientation if entrained, while more stable models did not. Our study suggests that as productidines radiated during the Carboniferous, they also differentiated within the performance space.

AB  - Worldwide, interest is growing in the reliability of using macroinvertebrates as wetland condition indicators and for signaling restoration or mitigation success. We compared macroinvertebrate community structure and environmental parameters of reference sites to restoration sites, representing re-establishment and enhancement techniques. To determine which environmental parameters are suitable indicators of macroinvertebrate community metrics (i.e., taxon richness, diversity and evenness), we compared macroinvertebrate communities with a suite of environmental and habitat variables, such as standing water duration, dissolved oxygen (DO) content, pH, and vegetation cover by stand height or growth form. Data were collected from 16 wetland sites in four categories: 4 re-establishment, 4 enhancement, and 4 of each closed or open canopy reference. Each year for two years, hydrology, water quality, and vegetation attributes were sampled at each site, along with macroinvertebrate community sampling. Vegetation variables were primary drivers of macroinvertebrate community metrics. Though DO was positively correlated with macroinvertebrate taxa evenness, multiple vegetation variables were strongly related to taxa evenness. Sites supporting higher macroinvertebrate richness and diversity had longer inundation times, more coverage of filamentous algae, and fewer dominant tree species. If providing habitat supportive of macroinvertebrate taxon richness and diversity are restoration goals, then appropriate mitigation designs should incorporate heterogeneous mixtures of habitat types ranging from open to partially closed canopies which influence inundation duration, DO, and algal cover. Further, our results suggest that a suite of vegetation variables in conjunction with hydrology have potential to be used as proxies for assessing wetland macroinvertebrate community metrics.

AB  - Laccase is increasingly adopted in diverse industrial and environmental applications, due to its readily accessible requirements for efficient catalytic synthesis and biotransformation of chemicals. However, it is perceived that its industrial production might incur some unfavorable overhead, which leads to expensive market products, and the corresponding negative environmental feedback, due to the use of capital-intensive and precarious chemicals. To this end, this study was designed to evaluate the performance indicators of the valorization of wheat bran by a novel Jb1b laccase and its subsequent application in waste minimization and water management, on a laboratory scale. Optimal Jb1b laccase was produced in submerged fermentation medium containing wheat bran, an agroindustrial residue, through response surface methodology (RSM) algorithm, and was applied in dye decolorization and denim bioscouring, respectively. Results showed that the resultant enzyme manifested unique biochemical properties, such as enhanced tolerance at certain physicochemical conditions, with a residual activity of at least ca. 76%. Furthermore, phenomenally high concentrations of synthetic dyes (0.2% w v(-1)) were decolorized over 56 h, and a 6 h mediator-supported simultaneous denim bleaching and decolorization of wash effluent was observed. The sustainability of the production and application processes were inferred from the reusability of the fermentation sludge as a potential biofertilizer, with subsequent prospects for the biostimulation and bioaugmentation of contaminated soils, whereas the decolorized water could be adopted for other uses, amongst which horticulture and forestry are typical examples. These phenomena therefore authenticate the favorable environmental feedbacks and overhead realized in this present study.

AB  - More high-quality, in situ observations of essential marine variables are needed over the seasonal ice zone to better understand Arctic (or Antarctic) weather, climate, and ecosystems. To better assess the potential for arrays of uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) to provide such observations, five wind-driven and solar-powered saildrones were sailed into the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas following the 2019 seasonal retreat of sea ice. They were equipped to observe the surface oceanic and atmospheric variables required to estimate air-sea fluxes of heat, momentum and carbon dioxide. Some of these variables were made available to weather forecast centers in real time. Our objective here is to analyze the effectiveness of existing remote ice navigation products and highlight the challenges and opportunities for improving remote ice navigation strategies with USVs. We examine the sources of navigational sea-ice distribution information based on post-mission tabulation of the sea-ice conditions encountered by the vehicles. The satellite-based ice-concentration analyses consulted during the mission exhibited large disagreements when the sea ice was retreating fastest (e.g., the 10% concentration contours differed between analyses by up to ?175 km). Attempts to use saildrone observations to detect the ice edge revealed that in situ temperature and salinity measurements varied sufficiently in ice bands and open water that it is difficult to use these variables alone as a reliable ice-edge indicator. Devising robust strategies for remote ice zone navigation may depend on developing the capability to recognize sea ice and initiate navigational maneuvers with cameras and processing capability onboard the vehicles.

AB  - N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a carcinogen and a disinfection byproduct that is formed by ozone and combined chlorine. Various factors affecting NDMA formation and removal were examined at pilotscale for a treatment train consisting of ozone, biologically-active carbon (BAC) filtration, and granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption applied to two distinct feed waters. High concentrations of ozone and monochloramine were added to the influent, demonstrating that ozone removed monochloramine precursors of NDMA. Further, longer empty bed contact times (EBCTs) of 10 min for BAC and 10 and 20 min for GAC removed NDMA to <10 ng/L for both feed waters. NDMA removal by the BAC process was most favorable >22 degrees C, presumably due to elevated microbial activity. A monochloramine residual of 3 mg/L-Cl-2 in the BAC influent reduced NDMA removal in the 5 min EBCT BAC from 79% to 36% and in the 10 min EBCT BAC from 88.5% to 73.7%. The absence of ozone in the treatment process significantly reduced NDMA formed post ozone, but decreased NDMA removal in BAC, probably due to lower NDMA concentration in the BAC influent. Finally, adding 5 mg/L of allylthiourea, an inhibitor of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, indicated that removal mechanisms for ammonia and NDMA are distinct. However, nitrification is still a good indicator for NDMA biodegradation potential, because nitrifying bacteria appear to flourish under similar EBCT, temperature. and monochloramine residual conditions during BAC filtration.

AB  - Daily temperature variation (DTV) is an important warming-related stressor that may magnify pesticide toxicity. Yet, it is unknown whether the pesticide impact under DTV is partly ameliorated by a faster pesticide degradation caused by cyclically higher temperatures under DTV. As synergisms may be more likely under energy-limiting conditions, the impact of the pesticide chlorpyrifos was tested under DTV on the mosquito Culex pipiens in the absence and presence of interspecific competition with the water flea Daphnia magna. Chlorpyrifos exposure at a constant temperature without interspecific competition caused considerable mortality, decreased development time, and increased pupal mass of C. pipiens. Competition with D. magna had negative sublethal effects, but it did not affect the toxicity of chlorpyrifos. In contrast, the presence of C. pipiens decreased the impact of chlorpyrifos on D. magna probably due to corporal absorption of chlorpyrifos by C. pipiens. A key finding was that chlorpyrifos no longer caused lethal effects on C. pipiens under DTV, despite DTV on its own being mildly lethal. Additionally, chlorpyrifos exposure under DTV decreased development time less and had no effect anymore on pupal mass compared to chlorpyrifos exposure at a constant temperature. Similarly, the negative chlorpyrifos impact on adult survival of D. magna was less under DTV than at the constant temperature. This could be explained by a faster chlorpyrifos degradation under DTV. This antagonism between pesticide exposure and DTV is likely widespread because organisms experience DTV, many pesticides are applied in pulses, and pesticide degradation is faster at higher temperatures.

AB  - Balanites aegyptiaca is a characteristic and emblematic tree species native to the dry zones of Africa and Asia. It has considerable socio-economic importance throughout its natural range of distribution because of its multiple uses. Despite this, the technological properties of its wood are not well known, hence sometimes inappropriate uses but potential for others. In order to match applications to characteristics of the wood, we determined physical stability indicators (density, infradensity, total radial shrinkage, total tangential shrinkage, total volumetric shrinkage and fibre saturation point) and mechanical behaviour indicators (longitudinal modulus of elasticity, bending strength and compression strength). Ninety-three specimens taken from 13 trees from the Sahelian and Sudanian zones in Chad and the Sahelian zone in Senegal were tested. Our results show that B. aegyptiaca wood from these three provenances is medium-heavy (797 kg/m(3)) with moderate dimensional stability: shrinkage anisotropy is above 2 (2.2) and total radial and tangential shrinkage rates are medium at 4 % and 8.5 % respectively. Its mechanical characteristics are medium (static bending and compression strength at 49.4 MPa and 104.5 MPa respectively) to weak (longitudinal modulus of elasticity at 10,473 MPa). A comparison of the results obtained according to the provenance of the specimens showed variable tendencies depending on the characteristics analysed, although the variations between the three provenances are limited. Our study results show that the use of B. aegyptiaca wood as a material could be appropriate for a wider range of purposes, on condition that suitable management methods are in place with a view to their restoration by planting.

AB  - Internal browning (IB) of Japanese radish, in which the entire central part of the root changes from light tan to dark brown, is a physiological disorder caused by heat stress at the root maturation stage and represents significant economic losses to farmers. In this study, we cultivated three cultivars with different tolerance to IB disorder under high-temperature conditions, and examined the physiological factors involved in IB disorder differences among cultivars. There was a close correlation between the severity of IB disorder among cultivars and the size of root parenchymal cells. Significantly smaller cells were observed in the IB-resistant cultivars compared to the IB-susceptible one. Glucose concentration and invertase gene expression level tended to be higher in the normal roots of the IB-susceptible cultivar than in those of the resistant cultivars. Results of immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hexanoyl-lysine and acrolein, which are indicators of oxidative stress, in parenchymal cells were significantly elevated in the normal mots of the IB-susceptible cultivar than in those of the resistant ones. Similarly, the normal roots of the IB-susceptible cultivar showed elevated levels of N epsilon-(carboxymethyelysine, which is an indicator of the Maillard reaction, compared with those of the resistant cultivars. In addition, the immunohistochemistry of these indicators of oxidative stress and the Maillard reaction were more strongly observed in the damaged roots of the IB-susceptible cultivar. These results indicate that the occurrence of IB in Japanese radish is closely related to the increase in cell size, enhancement of the Maillard reaction by elevation in reducing sugar concentration, and increase in intracellular oxidative stress.

AB  - Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) are powerful electro-technological installations. Their electric power ranges from 1 MVA in arc furnaces of a small capacity to more than 175 MVA in modern high-power furnaces with a capacity exceeding 200 tons. The main indicator of their energy efficiency, i.e. the amount of the electricity consumed per ton of molten steel, largely depends on the quality of the automatic control system (ACS) of the arc length, which is characterized by the speed and level of fluctuations of electrical disturbances, i.e. dynamics quality. The higher the speed and the smaller the oscillations (ideally non-oscillating, i.e. aperiodic, nature of the arc length deviations), the shorter the time of the perturbation control, and, hence, the less unproductive electricity losses in the power supply network and the short network of the arc furnace itself. Therefore, the development of solutions to improve the existing systems to control the arc length, which in electrometallurgy are called the arc power controllers, in order to increase their speed and improve the reaction to perturbations, is important because, given the significant installed capacity, it will save a considerable amount of electricity and, accordingly, reduce the cost per ton of molten steel and improve other energy efficiency indicators. The paper proposes an improved mathematical model of the modified arc length control law and creates a Simulink model of the power-supply system and electric mode coordinates ACS of an DSP-200 furnace. The results, obtained with the Simulink model, confirm an improvement of the dynamics indicators when working under the influence of perturbations, which is a necessary condition for a complex improvement of the EAF energy efficiency indicators.

AB  - Heavy metals in honey are of interest not only for quality control, but also as an environmental indicator. In the present work, we developed a new selective and rapid magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction (MDSPE) method for the separation/determination of Al(III) in honey samples by the zetasizer system. The synthesis of a new nanocomposite comprised of aminosilanized magnetic graphane oxide (GO/Fe3O4/APS)-coated 2-hydroxy-5-methyl-1,3-benzene-dicarboxaldehyde (HB) (GO/Fe3O4/APS@HB) is synthesized and characterized in for the first time the present work. The parameters influential on the determination of Al(III) including the pH of the sample, sorption time, amount of nanocomposite, eluent type, concentration, volume, and elution time, were investigated and optimized. These magnetic nanocomposites carrying Al(III) could be easily separated from honey samples simply by applying an external magnetic field; no filtration/centrifugation was necessary. Moreover, GO/Fe3O4/APS@HB demonstrates selectivity toward Al(III). Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits (DL) of the method for Al(III) was found to be (3 s) 0.13 mu g L--1,L- the preconcentration factor was calculated as 65, and the relative standard deviation was obtained as <= 2% for n = 11. The method was performed for the determination of Al(III) in some honey samples. The proposed techniques show satisfactory sensitivity, selectivity, detection limits and standard deviation for Al(III) determination in a honey sample. The method is suitable for the analysis of honey samples, which are challenging to analyze using other spectroscopy techniques.

AB  - Summertime upwelling of deep, corrosive waters on the continental shelf of the northern California Current System can exacerbate ocean acidification conditions, providing unsuitable environments for development of calcifying organisms and finfish that are important to the local economy. To better understand the carbonate system in this dynamic region, two recently developed technologies were combined with other sensors to obtain high-frequency carbon profile data from July 2017 to September 2017. The compact, low-power sensor package was composed of an optical sensor for partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)optode, Aanderaa model #4797) integrated onto a wave-powered PRofiling crAWLER (PRAWLER). The PRAWLER profiled from 3 to 80 m, stopping at fixed depths for varying lengths of time to allow forpCO(2)equilibration.pCO(2)derived from a regional empirical algorithm was used to correct optode drift using data at 80 m. Near-surface adjusted optodepCO(2)agreed within 6 +/- 42 mu atm to surfacepCO(2)from a nearby Moored AutonomouspCO(2)instrument. Throughout the water column, optodepCO(2)compared to algorithmpCO(2)within -28 +/- 66 mu atm. Overall, optode uncertainty was 35-72 mu atm based on root-mean-square errors from all comparison data sets. Errors are attributed to optode calibration, adjustment, algorithm uncertainty, and environmental variability between optode and reference data. Improvements for optode performance within this profiling application include using more stable sensing foils, in situ calibration, and pumped flow over the sensing foil. Additionally, the study revealed undersaturated (corrosive) waters with respect to aragonite below 60 m throughout the deployment that reached up to 40 m by mid-September.

AB  - Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and bacterial pathogens from combined sewer overflow (CSO) in peri-urban streams represent a major public health concern worldwide. In this study, the relationships between the hydrological regime and the loads and persistence of CSO-borne bacterial contaminants among benthic sediments of a small peri-urban stream were explored. Combined sewer overflow events and their impact on benthic sediment layers at a short distance from a CSO were monitored. Concentrations of Escherichia coli (EC) and intestinal enterococci (IE) and of two bacterial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Aeromonas caviae (AC), were assessed. Relations with hydraulic, hydromorphic and physicochemical factors were analysed. PA cells in benthic sediments increased exponentially with time (0.15 log PA per day), as long as the river discharge remained below the sediment transport. Cycles of erosive floods and low-flow periods were found to play a critical role in PA settling and growth among benthic riverbed sediments. These hydrological and hydraulic shear forces did not correlate with changing IE, EC, and AC concentrations in the benthic sediments. Their dynamics were rather related to changing physicochemical conditions (total N, phosphate, and organic carbon). AC population size decreases most rapidly with a mean rate of 0.04 log per day according to the duration of the low-flow period, indicating a poor tropism of AC for river systems. River sediments were found significant biotopes for PA outdoor development. These analyses demonstrate the significance of PA and AC as long- and short-term indicators, respectively, of a river microbiological quality.

AB  - Coordinating in action groups consists of continuously adapting behaviors in response to fluctuating conditions, ideally with limited disruption to a group's collective performance. Through an 18-month ethnography of how members of a community choir maintained beautiful, ongoing performance, I explored how they continuously adapted their coordinating, starting when they felt that their collective performance was fragmented or falling apart. The process model I developed shows that this aesthetic experience-the sense of fragmentation based on inputs from the bodily senses-leads to emotional triggering, meaning group members' emotions prompt changes in their attention and behavior. They then distribute their attention in new ways, increasing their focus on both global qualities of their ongoing performance (in this context, the musical score and conductor) and local qualities (singers' contributions). My findings suggest that by changing what aspects of a situation compose their immediate experience, action group members can adapt their coordinating behaviors by changing their heed: the behavior that demonstrates their attentiveness and awareness. The intertwining of attention and emotions helps explain how groups move between heedless and heedful interrelating over time, leading to an aesthetic experience of collective performance as being whole or coherent. My research shows that embodied forms of cognition (what we know from direct experience of an environment) complement accounts of how representational forms of knowledge (what we know from symbols, concepts, or ideas) facilitate real-time adaptation in groups. These insights have implications for a range of organizations engaged in complex action group work.

AB  - Soil carbon sequestration is a complex process influenced by agricultural practices, climate and soil conditions. Labile organic carbon is sensitive to soil management practices and thus provides better management of carbon dynamics than total carbon alone. Thus, an attempt is made here to investigate the Carbon sequestration potential and labile pool of soil organic carbon (SOC) in post kharif-2014 in flooded tropical rice (Oryza sativa L.) under long-term fertilizer experiment started in the year 2005-06 in the central farm of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) under All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) taking rice as a test crop. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Block Design with quadruplicated treatments. The treatments include no fertilization, 100% N, 100% NP, 100% NPK, 150% NPK and 100% NPK+FYM. The results revealed that cultivation over the years caused a 14% decrease in SOC in unfertilized control over uncultivated soil. The carbon sequestration potential (1.77 Mg ha(-1)) was highest in 100%NPK + FYM treatment. The greater accumulation of microbial biomass C, water and extractable carbon (WEO-C), potassium permanganate oxidizable C (KMnO4-C) was recorded in 100%NPK + FYM treatment. The highest carbon management index (CMI) was computed in 100%NPK with FYM. CMI can be used as a more sensitive indicator of the rate of change of SOC in response to soil management changes. Results suggested that 100% NPK + FYM are adequate for maintaining SOC stock and this practice may help in maintaining the sustainability of rice-rice cropping system.

AB  - Fecal microorganisms can enter water bodies in diverse ways, including runoff, sewage discharge, and direct fecal deposition. Once in water, the microorganisms experience conditions that are very different from intestinal habitats. The transition from host to aquatic environment may lead to rapid inactivation, some degree of persistence, or growth. Microorganisms may remain planktonic, be deposited in sediment, wash up on beaches, or attach to aquatic vegetation. Each of these habitats offers a panoply of different stressors or advantages, including UV light exposure, temperature fluctuations, salinity, nutrient availability, and biotic interactions with the indigenous microbiota (e.g., predation and/or competition). The host sources of fecal microorganisms are likewise numerous, including wildlife, pets, livestock, and humans. Most of these microorganisms are unlikely to affect human health, but certain taxa can cause waterborne disease. Others signal increased probability of pathogen presence, e.g., the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and enterococci and bacteriophages, or act as fecal source identifiers (microbial source tracking markers). The effects of environmental factors on decay are frequently inconsistent across microbial species, fecal sources, and measurement strategies (e.g., culture versus molecular). Therefore, broad generalizations about the fate of fecal microorganisms in aquatic environments are problematic, compromising efforts to predict microbial decay and health risk from contamination events. This review summarizes the recent literature on decay of fecal microorganisms in aquatic environments, recognizes defensible generalizations, and identifies knowledge gaps that may provide particularly fruitful avenues for obtaining a better understanding of the fates of these organisms in aquatic environments.

AB  - Anthocyanin accumulation is the main factor underlying why young plant leaves turn red, and plant growth follows the principle of maximizing the economic efficiency of energy. There is a need to verify the role of young plant leaves turning red and confirm whether anthocyanin accumulation overconsumes the energy of the plant.
   We compared the different pigment contents, antioxidant capacities, leaf mass per area, photosynthetic characteristics, dark respiration rates, light compensation points (LCPs) and electron flow distribution of young and mature Schima superba leaves grown under full sunlight and 30% full sunlight conditions. We then examined the correlations between anthocyanins and total antioxidant capacity, photosynthetic pigments, dark respiration rates, LCPs by using linear regression. Finally, we analyzed Pearson correlation coefficients and used principal component analysis to evaluate the interactions of these functional indicators.
   The young leaves of S. superba accumulated anthocyanins in full sunlight but not in 30% full sunlight. Anthocyanins substantially contributed to the total antioxidant capacity (accounting for 33.29%) in juvenile S. superba leaves. Young leaves containing more anthocyanin accumulated less reactive oxygen species after high light (HL) treatment. However, juvenile leaves accumulating anthocyanins showed 56.97% higher dark respiration rates, 24.79% higher LCPs and 5.32% higher allocations of electron flow to photorespiration and lower organic substance accumulation than did those without anthocyanins. These results suggest that young S. superba leaves must consume more energy to accumulate anthocyanins to adapt to HL environments. Therefore, plants sacrifice growth rate to ensure survival, which is a trade-off for their ability to respond to external environments.

AB  - This research aims to understand the difference of major land-cover change results caused in various time periods and to examine the impacts of human-induced factors on land-cover changes along the TransAmazon Highway region. The Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager data from 2011, 2014, and 2017 and our previous land-cover classification results in 1991, 2000, and 2008 were used to examine land-cover dynamics. A classification system consisting of five land-cover classes - primary forest (PF), secondary forest (SF), agropasture (AP), urban area, and water - were chosen. The hierarchical-based classification method was used to generate land-cover classification results, and the post-classification comparison approach was used to produce detailed "from-to" conversions for each detection period. The emphasis was on deforestation of PF, dynamic change of SF and AP, and urbanization over time. The impacts of human-induced factors such as population and economic conditions on urban expansion, AP expansion, and deforestation were examined. This research indicated that selection of a suitable time period was critical for effectively detecting land-cover changes; that is, too long time period (i.e., 9 years) cannot accurately capture some land-cover changes such as the AP and SF in this research. Although deforestation - the conversion from PF to SF and AP - accounted for a large proportion of land-cover changes, the changes between SF and AP became more important than PF conversion, and required a short time period (i.e., 3 years here) for effectively reflecting their dynamics.

AB  - Nanotechnology has been widely applied in agriculture, and understanding of the mechanisms of plant interaction with nanoparticles (NPs) as environmental contaminants is important. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of foliar application of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) NPs on some morpho-physiological and biochemical changes of canola (Brassfea napus L.) leaves. Seeds were sown in plastic pots and grown under controlled conditions. Fourtmn-day-old seedlings were sprayed with different concentrations of Co3O4 NPs (0. 50. 100. 250. 500, 1000. 2000, and 4000 mg L-1) at weekly intervals for 5 weeks. Growth parameters of the shoot (length. fresh and dry weights) were stimulated by low concentrations of Co3O4 NPs (50 and 100 mg L-1) and repressed by higher concentrations. Similar trends were observed in photosynthetic pigment contents. The results indicated that high concentrations of Co3O4 NPs increased lipoxygenase (LOX) activity and the malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). and dehydroascorbate (DHA) contents, but reduced the membrane stability index (MSI). ascorbate (ASC). and glutathione (GSH). Despite the increase of antioxidant capacity (DPPH) and the accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants (total flavonolds and flavonols) and osmolytes (proline, glycine betaine (GB) and soluble sugars) at high concentrations of Co3O4 NPs, the growth and photosynthesis were reduced. The defence system activity did not seem to be sufficient to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS). Altogether, high concentrations of Co3O4 NPs showed a phytotoxic potential for canola as an oilseed crop.

AB  - The aim of the work is to develop a methodology for assessing the bio-corrosive aggressiveness of soils in the areas where oil pipelines are laid, which does not require long-term corrosion tests. The assessment of soil bio-corrosion risk is based on its integrated corrosion and microbiological tests.
   To conduct field and laboratory corrosion tests, the most typical for Russia soils were selected, which are universal in terms of options for the development of bio-corrosion damage: high humus and high clay content loams, low humus and high sand content loams, and muddy swamp soil. In the testing process, samples of the steel 20 were used, the corrosion resistance of which is comparable to the corrosion resistance of pipe steels. The results of laboratory and field research of the soil are presented in this article.
   The main external factor affecting the level of soil bio-corrosive activity is microbial consortium composition (qualitative and quantitative). The formation of microbiocenoses is influenced by the composition and structure of the soil, its moisture content and the content of organic and inorganic substances in free form, the temperature factor affecting the accumulation of organic substances in the upper soil horizons in the summer, pH conditioned by the presence of mineral substances in soluble form. For the assessment of biocorrosive activity, from among the electrochemical indicators, the specific soil electrical resistance is informative, which characterizes the soil moisture and mineralization, affecting the development of microbiocenosis.

AB  - Demonstrating sustainable land management (SLM) requires an understanding of the linkages between grazing management and environmental stewardship. Grazing management practices that incorporate strategic periods of rest are promoted internationally as best practice. However, spatial and temporal trends in unmanaged feral (goat) and native (kangaroo) populations in the southern Australian rangelands can result land managers having, at times, control over less than half the grazing pressure, precluding the ability to rest pastures. Few empirical studies have examined the impacts of total grazing pressure (TGP) on biodiversity and resource condition, while the inability to manage grazing intensity at critical times may result in negative impacts on ground cover, changes in pasture species composition, increased rates of soil loss and reduce the ability for soils to store carbon. The widespread adoption of TGP control through exclusion fencing in the southern Australian rangelands has created unprecedented opportunities to manage total grazing pressure, although there is little direct evidence that this infrastructure leads to more sustainable land management. Here we identify several key indicators that are either outcome- or activity-based that could serve as a basis for verification of the impacts of TGP management. Since TGP is the basic determinant of the impact of herbivory on vegetation it follows that the ability for rangeland pastoral management to demonstrate SLM and environmental stewardship will rely on using evidence-based indicators to support environmental social licence to operate.

AB  - Although flax fibres are largely used to reinforce plastic, the quality of these fibres depends on the cultivation conditions, moreover, the global production volume of these fibres is also limited. The main aim of this current work was to investigate the feasibility of replacing flax fibres with bamboo fibres for reinforcing thermoplastics in terms of mechanical and environmental performance of both fibres. Two types of bamboo fibres, bamboo original fibres (BOF) and bamboo viscose fibres (BVF) and flax fibres as reference were used to reinforce polypropylene (PP). The composites were fabricated into laminates using manual stacking and hot pressing and the mechanical properties (tensile, flexural and impact) of the composites were evaluated. In order to evaluate the environmental performance of these composites life cycle assessment approach was conducted which showed that the composites reinforced with bamboo fibres were eco-friendlier as compared to the composites with flax fibres. However, the flax fibre-reinforced composite showed better mechanical performance. The BOF/PP composites showed better life cycle environmental performance as compared to both flax/PP and BVF/PP composites. Finally, a compatibilizer, i.e., maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene, was added which resulted in better mechanical and environmental performance of the bamboo fibre reinforced composites. Comparison between the environmental impacts of different disposal routes for the composites demonstrated that incineration and recycling are more environmental friendly disposal practises than placing waste in a landfill.

AB  - A module-based Green Infrastructure (GI) and Ecosystem Service (ES) approach, adapted to the specific requirements and conditions for railway line-side vegetation management, is presented in this paper. The multi-functionality of line-side vegetation is addressed by an integration of the GI and ES concepts. The use of widely available geo-data enables its applicability, both in terms of large-scale and other infrastructure networks. In this way it can serve as a feature for emphasizing the creation of a productive, attractive and cost effective landscape resource. A methodological approach for the Ecosystem Service Demand Assessment (ESDA) of GI line-side elements was developed and applied at a study site. An ESDA was performed concerning "Structural landscape diversity" and "Water and climate regulation". The results represent the composition of landscape types, the demand for structural landscape features, the distribution of GI line-side elements and hotspots of land consumption. Additionally, potential capacity of GI line-side vegetation to provide ecosystem services was addressed. Maps created provide basic information for the railway operator to consider ecosystem service demand in construction and maintenance works. In this way, the presented GIS approach can support decision-making-sovereignty in implementing holistic line-side vegetation management strategies. The use of high resolution geo-data proved to provide a good basis for the accurate mapping of GI line-side elements. The study has confirmed that high resolution geo-data and GIS technologies have great potentials regarding spatial data provision and as analytical frameworks for line-side vegetation management.

AB  - Circumalpine lakeside settlements have been declared Unesco world heritage in 2011. Their importance is mainly due to waterlogged preservation of organic material and hence the outstanding potential of these sites for performing detailed archaeological studies of prehistoric societies. However, the details of the taphonomic processes (depositional environment, development of anoxia, lateral or vertical displacement of objects, etc.) have rarely been studied. Consequently, interpretations based on find distributions or comparisons of find densities remain difficult. Zurich-Parkhaus Opera is a large-scale excavation of waterlogged Neolithic settlement deposits. Eight settlement phases of the late fourth and early third millennium BC were documented and dated using dendrochronology as well as six settlement layers, two of which showed excellent organic preservation. Based on a large number of sediment samples we conducted a multidisciplinary study in taphonomic processes influencing these layers. Our results indicate that a multi-indicator approach can provide detailed information on formation processes of waterlogged cultural layers. We found that 1) aquatic invertebrate remains and geotechnical calculations gave evidence for continuous shallow water conditions and eutrophic/anoxic deposition environment during occupation of the site. 2) Position and distribution of finds and loam patches indicate that disposal of household waste was focused on middens, which were still intact. 3) High variability in sediment contents (both spatially and in terms of state of preservation) is due to different factors such as oxygen depletion, deposition rate, erosion and enrichment of different materials, while all factors can affect each other resulting in highly complex formation processes.

AB  - The prediction of metal bioavailability in soils is critical to metal risk assessments and the amount of dissolved metal in soils is a key factor determining bioavailability. Because the recently developed geochemical multi surface models (MSMs) offer a promising tool for the determination of metal partitioning in soils, in this study, a MSM based on generic parameters was used to assess the bioavailability of Cd in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing in 12 soils with a wide range of properties. The amount of MSM-calculated dissolved Cd correlated strongly with the amount of Cd uptake by wheat (R-2 = 0.873 for roots and R-2 = 0.837 for shoots), and the model's performance was better than that of chemical extraction methods (0.01 M CaCl2, 0.43 M HNO3 and soil total Cd). The reactive fraction of soil organic matter, the soil/solution ratio, and the inclusion/exclusion of background cations influenced the calculation results. The best calculation condition was optimized. The application of the MSM was also examined in 84 wheat-soil samples from the field. The amount of Cd in wheat seeds had a stronger correlation with the amount of MSM-predicted Cd than with the amount of Cd obtained using chemical extraction methods. Our results suggested that MSM-calculated Cd is an effective indicator of the bioavailability of Cd in soils and demonstrated the utility of the method as a tool to assess the risk of Cd contamination in soils.

AB  - Nutrient availability and molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) determine whether the carbon (C) associated with DOM is respired during decomposition or exported from stream networks. High-latitude ecosystems are changing rapidly due to permafrost thaw, shifts in vegetation, and increasing runoff, which alter sources of DOM and nutrients to rivers. To address how changes in the composition of riverine DOM and nutrients may influence C cycling, we quantified biolability of DOM across a latitudinal gradient in Alaska and assessed temporal patterns associated with intra-annual variation in hydrology. We measured biolability under ambient and fertilized conditions and characterized optical and chemical properties of DOM to determine the relative influence of nutrients and molecular composition of DOM on its fate in rivers. Biolability was low, comprising 4% of the DOM pool on average and 0-42% across all sites and seasons. Optical indicators of the molecular composition of the DOM pool were more constant in space and time than bulk concentrations of dissolved C and nutrients, and described a DOM pool dominated by humic-like functional groups. Phosphorus limited biolability at freshet, but biolability was not linked to DOM composition. Strong hydrologic connection of high-latitude rivers to a large pool of soil organic matter likely results in export of recalcitrant DOM to receiving rivers and coasts in this region, contributing to stability of the high-latitude C cycle. However, increased inputs of phosphorus or DOM of greater biolability will likely cause increased respiration of riverine DOM and flux of CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB  - The extent of genetic diversity within a species is an important determinant of successful adaptation to adverse environmental conditions. Assessment of extent of genetic diversity/variability is also important to monitor genetic erosion within a species. In threatened plant species, genetic diversity assessment helps in selection of genetically diverse populations to enrich the genetically impoverished populations, thus minimizing the probability of genetic drift. Confirming taxonomic identity of threatened species, particularly those belonging to species complexes with dispute identity, is another essential task in the conservation of threatened species, which is best resolved through molecular approaches. The present study estimated the genetic variability within and among the populations of four threatened species, viz. Justicia beddomei (C.B. Clarke) Bennet (Acanthaceae), Embelia ribes Burm. f. (Myrsinaceae), Madhuca insignis (Radlk.) H.J. Lam (Sapotaceae) and Cycas beddomei Dyer Cycadaceae) using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers for selecting the genetically diverse populations. The phylogeny was analysed through ITS (nrDNA) and matK (cpDNA) sequences to confirm the species identity.
   The phylogenetic analyses confirmed four distinct species of Justicia, which also revealed that J. beddomei and J. adhatoda were sister groups with a common ancestor showing rapid parallel speciation with J. gendarussa in one clade and J. betonica in another. Madhuca insignis with extremely small population in the Western Ghats (Karnataka to Kerala) might have undergone either extensive hybridization or incipient speciation. In case of Embelia species, a greater evolutionary closeness between E. subcoraceae and E. floribunda was revealed, while E. ribes had a distinct clad. Both ISSR and SSR markers distinguished various genotypes of Cycas beddomei.

AB  - The Oltu Gemstone is located in the north of Oltu town (Erzurum-NE Turkey) city as a low rank coal. The Oltu Gemstone occurs as lenticular forms with thickness not exceeding centimeter size and lateral continuity of a few meters within the Liassic Lower Mahn Olurdere Formation consisting chiefly of claystone, sandstone, and volcanics. Coals that are operated as Oltu Gemstone are represented by very high TOC (67.39-78.56% wt), high hydrogen index (HI) values (314-379 mg HC/g TOC) and very low oxygen index (01) values (1-3 mg CO2/g TOC). Low Pr/Ph ratios indicate that coals were prevented from oxidation and deposited under anoxic conditions. In Oltu Gemstone samples, C-29 dominates over C-27 and C-28 steranes. In general, high (C-19 + C-20)/C-23 tricyclic terpane, low Ts/(Ts + Tm), diasterane/sterane, and C31R/C-30 hopane ratios were recorded. C-29 MA steroids dominate with respect to others, and the C-29/(C-28 + C-29) MA ratio is mostly high. DBT/P ratio of Oltu Gemstone samples has low values. T-max values of Oltu Gemstone samples (between 416 and 436 degrees C) reflect immature-early mature character. 22S/(22R+ 22S) homohopane, 20S/(20R + 20S), and beta beta/(alpha + beta beta) sterane ratios and low moretane/hopane ratios, relatively high C-28-TA/(C-29-MA + C-28-TA), MA(I)/MA(I + II), TA(I)/TA(I + II), MPI-3 (beta/alpha MP), and MDR ratios indicate early mature character for the Oltu Gemstone samples.

AB  - The goal of the article is to find the answer whether it is possible to propose a model for fixing the best debt levels in the capital structure of non-profit organisations. Capital structure is an indicator that corroborates the level of financial risk. Non-profit organisations are an essential part of the general social policy. When considering the efficiency of non-profit entities from a donor perspective, it is important to take into account the way management uses the resources of a non-profit organisation as well as efficiency of that management activity. Non-profit organisation efficiency should be considered in the context of risk. One of the most important ways to increase probability to face financial distress is too high debt to equity relation. The paper illustrates the relationship between debt and equity in 1,560 Polish non-profit entities. The model which can fix optimal capital structure for a non-profit organisation in its current environment was delivered. The proposal of the paper includes a model which helps to find the optimal level of debt for non-profit organisation environmental conditions. The novelty of the model is based on the full costs of debt financing non-profit entities in the context of donor expectations, which in the Polish social and economic environment means that costs indirectly linked with the realisation of the main aim of the social entity cannot be higher than 10% of the collected money sources. An additional point of our findings is that in comparison with the current state, Polish non-profit organisations need to improve their way of fixing capital structure.

AB  - Sustainable production and consumption in the rural regions remains a barely tried yet important issue for contributing to rural sustainability these days. In particular, the sustainable livelihood of rural farmers has not been fully investigated for those in rural areas with high agricultural pollution emissions and a poor ecological quality of agricultural production in China. Also affected are farmers with a low living standard and output, or suffer from social inequity. The sustainable livelihood security (SLS) index therefore provides a useful means of identifying the existence of the conditions necessary for sustainable livelihood or sustainable development. Using the fuzzy comprehensive method, this paper aims to assess the level of sustainable livelihood security of China's provincial farmers and its three components of ecological security, economic efficiency and social equity. A SLS index is established and the entropy weight method used to determine the weight of the indices and analyze spatial distribution. The results indicate that the sustainable livelihood security index and its components vary between provincial regions, with the western provinces being most adversely affected, sustainable livelihood, economic efficiency and social equity being the least secure (or relatively insecure) in the western provinces while economic efficiency is most secure (or relatively secure) in the eastern and middle provinces, and social equity most secure in the eastern provinces. Concluding remarks suggest policies designed to improve the sustainable livelihood security of farmers according to local regional circumstances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes has become a popular model species for toxicity testing over the past few decades. However, the combined influence of temperature and food shortage, two climate change-related stressors, has never been assessed in this species. Consequently, effects of three temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and six food regimes (between 0 and 5 x 10(5) algal cells/mL) on the life cycle of N. spinipes were examined in this study. Similarly to other copepod species, development times and brood sizes decreased with rising temperatures. Mortality was lowest in the 20 degrees C temperature setup, indicating a close-by temperature optimum for this species. Decreasing food concentrations led to increased development times, higher mortality and a reduction in brood size. A sex ratio shift toward more females per male was observed for increasing temperatures, while no significant relationship with food concentration was found. Temperature and food functions for each endpoint were integrated into an existing individual-based population model for N. spinipes which in the future may serve as an extrapolation tool in environmental risk assessment. The model was able to accurately reproduce the experimental data in subsequent verification simulations. We suggest that temperature, food shortage, and potentially other climate change-related stressors should be considered in environmental risk assessment of chemicals to account for non-optimal exposure conditions that may occur in the field. Furthermore, we advocate combining in vivo bioassays with population modeling as a cost effective higher tier approach to assess such considerations.

TI  - Early Fault Detection of Hot Components in Gas Turbines
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA  - English
KW  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - The working environment of hot components is the most adverse of all gas turbine components. Malfunction of hot components is often followed by catastrophic consequences. Early fault detection plays a significant role in detecting performance deterioration immediately and reducing unscheduled maintenance. In this paper, an early fault detection method is introduced to detect early fault symptoms of hot components in gas turbines. The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is usually used to monitor the performance of the hot components. The EGT is measured by several thermocouples distributed equally at the outlet of the gas turbine. EGT profile is symmetrical when the unit is in normal operation. And the faults of hot components lead to large temperature differences between different thermocouple readings. However, interferences can potentially affect temperature differences, and sometimes, especially in the early stages of the fault, its influence can be even higher than that of the faults. To improve the detection sensitivity, the influence of interferences must be eliminated. The two main interferences investigated in this study are associated with the operating and ambient conditions, and the structure deviation of different combustion chambers caused by processing and installation errors. Based on the basic principles of gas turbines and Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), a new detection indicator is presented that characterizes the intrinsic structure information of the hot components. Using this new indicator, the interferences involving the certainty and the uncertainty are suppressed and the sensitivity of early fault detection in gas turbine hot components is improved. The robustness and the sensitivity of the proposed method are verified by actual data from a Taurus 70 gas turbine produced by Solar Turbines.

AB  - Riverine floodplain soils contain large stocks of soil organic matter (SOM) also in larger depth. Qualitative characterization of SOM, especially in the subsoil horizons of floodplain soils, is scarce. To gain deeper insights into the composition of SOM and the driving parameters of SOM processing, we studied 121 horizons of 18 soil profiles along the Central Elbe River (Germany) by determining permanganate-oxidizable carbon (PDXC) and a stability parameter derived from diffuse reflectance infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy. The absolute and relative amounts of PDXC varied between the horizons. While the topsoil horizons contained the largest total contents of PDXC (average 923 mg kg(-1) soil), the largest relative proportions were detected in subsoil horizons characterized by reducing conditions and water saturation (up to 19% of total organic C), which exceeded those reported for terrestrial soils. The absolute contents of PDXC were positively and partially highly significantly correlated with those of total organic, hot-water extractable and microbial-biomass C, confirming its nature as slightly processed and relatively labile fraction of SOM. The correlations were distinctly weaker for the reduced horizons, indicating hampered decomposition. The contents of PDXC were also positively correlated with the DRIFT stability parameter, expressing the ratio of aliphatic to aromatic C. Our results suggest the presence of a large fraction of less processed SOM in the subsoils of floodplain soils, originating from inputs of particulate organic matter that was buried and weakly decomposed at water saturation, and partially from charcoal particles, also transported by the river water. The results point to a possible limitation of PDXC as an indicator of decomposition to soils lacking an aquic moisture regime. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies have focused on how climate change could drive changes in phytoplankton communities in the Arctic. In contrast, ciliates and dinoflagellates that can contribute substantially to the mortality of phytoplankton have received less attention. Some dinoflagellate and ciliate species can also contribute to net photosynthesis, which suggests that species composition could reflect food web complexity. To identify potential seasonal and annual species occurrence patterns and to link species with environmental conditions, we first examined the seasonal pattern of microzooplankton and then performed an in-depth analysis of interannual species variability. We used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to identify ciliates and dinoflagellates to the lowest taxonomic level using a curated Arctic 18S rRNA gene database. DNA- and RNA-derived reads were generated from samples collected from the Canadian Arctic from November 2007 to July 2008. The proportion of ciliate reads increased in the surface toward summer, when salinity was lower and smaller phytoplankton prey were abundant, while chloroplastidic dinoflagellate species increased at the subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM), where inorganic nutrient concentrations were higher. Comparing communities collected in summer and fall from 2003 to 2010, we found that microzooplankton community composition change was associated with the record ice minimum in the summer of 2007. Specifically, reads from smaller predatory species like Laboea, Monodinium, and Strombidium and several unclassified ciliates increased in the summer after 2007, while the other usually summer-dominant dinoflagellate taxa decreased. The ability to exploit smaller prey, which are predicted to dominate the future Arctic, could be an advantage for these smaller ciliates in the wake of the changing climate.

AB  - Urban green works as a recorder of atmospheric PM. This paper reports on the utility of combining magnetic- and particle-based techniques to investigate PM leaf deposition as a bio-indicator of metal pollution. Ivy (Hedera helix) leaves were collected from five different land use classes, i.e. forest, rural, roadside, industrial, train. Leaf magnetic measurements were done in terms of saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (leaf SIRM), while ca. 40,000 leaf-deposited particles were analyzed through SEM/EDX to estimate the elemental composition. The influence of the different land use classes was registered both magnetically and in terms of metal content Leaf area-normalized SIRM values ranged from 19.9 to 4410 mu A, in the following order forest < rural < roadside < industrial < train. Leaf SIRM showed to be significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with the content in Fe, Zn, and Pb, followed by Mn and Cd (p < 0.05), while no significant correlation was found with the metals Cr and Cu. Although presenting a similar metal content, roadside and train were magnetically very distinct. By exhibiting a very high content in Pb, and with an Fe content being comparable to the one observed at the forest and rural land uses, the industrial leaf-deposited particles showed to be mainly due to industrial activity. While SEM/EDX is a suitable approach for detailed particle analysis, leaf SIRM of ivy can be used as a rapid discriminatory tool for metal pollution. Their complementary use delivers further knowledge on land use classes reflecting different PM conditions and/or sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth in ethanol production in the United States has sparked interest in potential land-use change and the associated environmental impacts that may occur in order to accommodate the increasing demand for grain feedstocks. In this study water quality and sustainability indicators are used to evaluate the impacts of land-use change to increase corn and grain sorghum acreage for biofuel production in the Perry Lake watershed in northeast Kansas. Water quality indicators include sediment loads per converted land acreage and the relative increase of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and sediment loads compared to the baseline conditions. Sustainability indicators include land-use, water use, and nutrient use efficiencies. Hay, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and winter wheat were selected as targeted land-uses for conversion to biofuel feedstocks. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to evaluate 6 different scenarios, each at 10 land-use change increments, for a total of 60 simulations. Results demonstrate that increased corn production generates significantly greater sediment loads than increased grain sorghum production and larger relative increases in nutrient loads. Expansion of corn or grain sorghum cropland by replacing hay or CRP land-uses resulted in the highest sediment loads and relative increases in nutrient loads. Expansion of corn or grain sorghum by replacing winter wheat cropland produced the lowest relative changes in nutrient and sediment loads and therefore may be a more sustainable land-use change. Corn had a higher yield potential per km(2) compared to grain sorghum, resulting in better land, nutrient and water use efficiencies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought assessment is important for developing measures to reduce agricultural vulnerability and thereby secure the livelihoods of those who depend on agriculture. This study uses four global ensemble weather prediction systems: the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the European Centre for Medium -Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the UK Met Office (UKMO), and the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in the THORPEX (The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive from 2006 to 2010. Based on results from the XXT (the first X denotes Xinanjiang, the second X denotes hybrid, and the T denotes TOPMODEL) distributed hydrological model, as well as soil moisture observations and digital elevation model (DEM) data, synthesized drought grades were established in the Huaihe River Basin of China. To filter out the impact of short-term fluctuations on observed soil moisture, a 30 -day moving average was calculated. Use of the moving average significantly improves the correlation between observed soil moisture and simulated soil water deficit depth. Finally, a linear regression model describing the relationship between observed soil moisture and simulated soil water deficit depth was constructed. The deterministic regression coefficient was 05872, the correlation coefficient was 0.77, and the regression coefficient was 15423. The trends in drought grades calculated using soil moisture and soil water deficit depth were found to be the same, and the grades agreed to within one level. Our findings highlight the importance of synthesizing drought grading when assessing drought using different soil moisture indicators in order to obtain a more comprehensive forecast of drought conditions.

AB  - Highland freshwater ecosystems respond rapidly to changing climatic conditions making the biota of mountain streams and rivers particularly vulnerable to climate change. Lack of data and concepts to monitor and manage the potential effects of climate change on freshwater biota is particularly evident in developing countries. Many of the highest and longest mountain systems are found in these regions and provide fundamental water-based services to these countries. The climate sensitive zone (CSZ) concept is based upon changes in community composition along altitudinal gradients that serve as a proxy for climatic gradients. The CSZ characterizes a community of climatically sensitive biota that is likely to react quickly to climate change. We present a framework on how the CSZ can be adapted to and implemented in streams, and demonstrate its applicability for central Himalayan streams of Nepal. We sampled and analyzed benthic invertebrate communities of 58 central Himalayan streams along altitudinal gradients from 1500 to 4500 m asl. A generalized linear model identified altitude as the only significant, albeit indirect, variable explaining benthic invertebrate composition. We applied species turnover scores and threshold indicator taxon analysis (TITAN) to identify the CSZ in central Himalayan streams along the extensive altitudinal gradients. An altitudinal band between 2900 and 3500 m was identified as CSZ and was characterized by 33 indicator taxa. Identifying CSZs in streams can help prioritize resources for monitoring climate change impacts in running waters and help pinpoint stream reaches suitable for testing the efficacy of climate change-directed mitigation practices.

AB  - Most transboundary rivers and their wetlands are subject to considerable anthropogenic pressures associated with multiple and often conflicting uses. In the Eastern Mediterranean such systems are also particularly vulnerable to climate change, posing additional challenges for integrated water resources management. Comprehensive measurements of the optical signature of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were combined with measurements of river discharges and water physicochemical and biogeochemical properties, to assess carbon dynamics, water quality, and anthropogenic influences in a major transboundary system of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Evros (or, Ma?a or, Meric) river and its Ramsar protected coastal wetland. Measurements were performed over three years, in seasons characterized by different hydrologic conditions and along transects extending more than 70 km from the freshwater end-member to two kilometers offshore in the Aegean Sea. Changes in precipitation, anthropogenic dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs from the polluted Ergene tributary, and the irregular operation of a dam were key factors driving water quality, salinity regimes, and biogeochemical properties in the Evros delta and coastal waters. Marsh outwelling affected coastal carbon quality, but the influence of wetlands was often masked by anthropogenic DOM contributions. A distinctive five-peak CDOM fluorescence signature was characteristic of upstream anthropogenic inputs and clearly tracked the influence of freshwater discharges on water quality. Monitoring of this CDOM fluorescence footprint could have direct applications to programs focusing on water quality and environmental assessment in this and other transboundary rivers where management of water resources remains largely ineffective.

AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify the magnitude of genotype-environment interaction (GxE) effects on age at first calving (AFC), scrotal circumference (SC), and yearling weight (YW) in Nellore cattle using reaction norms. For the study, 89,152 weight records of female and male Nellore animals obtained at yearling age were used. Genetic parameters were estimated with a single-trait random-regression model using Legendre polynomials as base functions. The heritability estimates were of low to medium magnitude for AFC (0.05 to 0.47) and of medium to high magnitude for SC (0.32 to 0.51) and YW (0.13 to 0.72), and increased as the environmental gradient became more favorable. The genetic correlation estimates ranged from 0.25 to 1.0 for AFC, from 0.71 to 1.0 for SC, and from 0.42 to 1.0 for YW. High Spearman correlation coefficients were obtained for the three traits, ranging from 0.97 to 0.99. The reaction norms along the environmental gradient of 10 sires each with the highest or lowest breeding value for YW predicted by single-trait analysis demonstrated more plastic phenotypes for YW and more robust phenotypes for SC. The effect of GxE was most important for YW and AFC with respect to SC. When animals are selected for higher SC or YW or lower AFC, considering or not the GxE effect, it is expected that the same animals will be selected. The reaction norms obtained based on sire breeding values along the environmental gradient showed that animals with extreme breeding values respond differently as environmental conditions improve.

AB  - Changing and more volatile climate conditions are leading to higher vulnerability and lower resilience for crop production. Recent studies indicate that crop diversity in agricultural fields may ensure pest control and yield stability in the face of environmental changes. However, few studies have evaluated crop diversity in the field, especially at the within-species level. Applying a new indicator, H-T*, which integrates both the spatial evenness of different varieties and molecular genetic data (within and between variety genetic diversity), we followed the evolution of bread wheat genetic diversity on French agricultural landscapes during the 20th century. To our knowledge, the monitoring of crop genetic diversity at such a large but detailed spatial and temporal scale has never before been conducted. In comparison to two frequently used but less integrative indicators (the number of varieties grown in the field and their allelic diversity as measured by the Nei index), the H-T* indicator revealed increasing genetic homogenization overall. This trend was due to the disappearance of diversity within varieties (initial replacement of landraces by more homogeneous old lines and later by modern pure lines), to the spatial homogenization occurring in the last period of the 20th century with the different 'departements' (French administrative territories) progressively cultivating the same varieties and to their increasing genetic similarities. This result calls into question the effects of plant breeding, seed system organization and seed regulation on wheat genetic diversity, especially in the context of current environmental changes.

AB  - Background: The evaluation of intestinal trophism, mainly the mucosal layer, is an important issue in various conditions associated with injury, atrophy, recovery, and healing of the gut. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetics of the proliferation and apoptosis of enterocytes by immunohistochemistry and to assess the complexity of intestinal mucosa by fractal dimension (FD) analysis in Solea solea fed different experimental diets.
   Results: Histomorphological evaluation of all intestinal segments did not show signs of degeneration or inflammation. Cell proliferation index and FD were significantly reduced with a diet high in mussel meal (MM; p = 0.0034 and p = 0.01063, respectively), while apoptotic index did not show any significant difference for the same comparison (p = 0.3859). Linear regression analysis between apoptotic index (independent variable) and FD (dependent variable) showed a statistically significant inverse relationship (p = 0.002528). Linear regression analysis between cell proliferation index (independent variable) and FD (dependent variable) did not show any significant correlation (p = 0.131582).
   Conclusions: The results demonstrated that diets containing increasing levels of mussel meal in substitution of fishmeal did not incite a hyperplastic response of the intestinal mucosa. The mussel meal, which is derived from molluscs, could mimic the characteristics of the sole's natural prey, being readily digestible, even without increasing the absorptive surface of intestinal mucosa. Interestingly, from this study emerged that FD could be used as a numeric indicator complementary to in situ quantification methods to measure intestinal trophism, in conjunction with functional parameters.

AB  - Oxygen and carbon stable isotope profiles were constructed for two species of large subtropical gastropods of the family Fasciolariidae-Triplofusus giganteus and Fasciolaria tulipa-from the Florida Keys and the Bahamas, to evaluate their life history and to assess their potential as paleoenvironmental proxies. Oxygen isotope profiles revealed T. giganteus and F. tulipa grew their shells for 6 and 3 years, respectively. Both mollusks show faster growth rates during the first half of their lifespan. Mean annual temperatures (MAT) derived from oxygen isotopes for T. giganteus were 26.5 A degrees C and for F. tulipa were 26.7 A degrees C, both matching instrumental MATs of 26.7 and 26.5 A degrees C for the Florida Keys. Both shells, however, failed to record entire mean annual temperature ranges (MART). Fasciolaria tulipa yielded a calculated MART of 5.6 A degrees C compared with a measured MART of 9.3 A degrees C, and T. giganteus showed a calculated MART of 6.9 A degrees C compared with a measured MART of 9.4 A degrees C. Carbon isotopes of T. giganteus were ambiguous and reveal no significant relationships with trends in nutrient concentrations (N and P), dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon, although they did exhibit more negative values concomitant with landfall of Hurricane Irene and trended to increasing values with ontogeny that could reflect migration. Carbon isotopes in F. tulipa were lower during winters, possibly reflecting seasonal upwelling or seagrass-mediated carbon cycling.

AB  - Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L) raises as a competitive oilseed crop in the current environmentally friendly context. To help targeting adequate management strategies, we explored statistical models as tools to understand and predict sunflower oil concentration. A trials database was built upon experiments carried out on a total of 61 varieties over the 2000-2011 period, grown in different locations in France under contrasting management conditions (nitrogen fertilization, water regime, plant density). 25 literature-based predictors of seed oil concentration were used to build 3 statistical models (multiple linear regression, generalized additive model (GAM), regression tree (RT)) and compared to the reference simple one of Pereyra-lrujo and Aguirrezabal (2007) based on 3 variables. Performance of models was assessed by means of statistical indicators, including root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) and model efficiency (EF). GAM-based model performed best (RMSEP = 1.95%; EF = 0.71) while the simple model led to poor results in our database (RMSEP = 3.33%; EF = 0.09). We computed hierarchical contribution of predictors in each model by means of R-2 and concluded to the leading determination of potential oil concentration (OC), followed by post-flowering canopy functioning indicators (LAD2 and MRUE2), plant nitrogen and water status and high temperatures effect. Diagnosis of error in the 4 statistical models and their domains of applicability are discussed. An improved statistical model (GAM-based) was proposed for sunflower oil prediction on a large panel of genotypes grown in contrasting environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental variability among freshwater habitats may influence migratory decisions in partially anadromous salmonids through (1) proximate effects on individual fish development and condition and (2) longer-term genetic adaptations of populations to the various environments. However, the relative importance of the two factors has been difficult to sort out. We used the gonadosomatic index as an indicator of maturation-and therefore residency-in age-1 and age-2 parr collected from eight partially anadromous Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout/steelhead) populations occupying a diversity of freshwater habitats. Substantial environmental variability among the eight Hood Canal (Washington) streams had little effect on life history pathways in male and female offspring of anadromous females (hereafter, ANAD parr), with the exception of significantly higher maturation rates in male ANAD parr from one population (Little Quilcene River). Between 0% and 8% of the female ANAD parr had initiated maturation, whereas 33% (Duckabush River) or 53% (Hamma Hamma River) maturation was observed among the female offspring of resident females (hereafter, RES parr) in the two populations with substantial resident components. The results indicate strong maternal control over offspring life history pathways in systems where resident and anadromous forms are sympatric. The RES parr that were collected above and below barriers to anadromy showed similar likelihoods of maturation. The expression of residency and anadromy in Hood Canal populations appears to reflect genetic adaptations to the diverse freshwater habitats (including the effects of O. mykiss sequestered above anadromy barriers) and, to some degree, the phenotypically plastic responses of male parr to the environmental variability among streams.

AB  - Plants absorb and carry soluble silica from soils and then deposit SiO2 center dot nH(2)O within themselves producing amorphous silica particles known as phytoliths. Trace amount of organic carbon is occluded during phytolith formation referred to as phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC). This carbon fraction has been recognized as an important way of carbon biosequestration. Previous studies have investigated the PhytOC contents of many crop plants and their contribution to global carbon sink. However, the PhytOC in soil is less focused. In this study, we investigated the distribution of soil PhytOC in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP).
   Twenty-six soil profiles were collected in the Chinese Loess Plateau. A wet oxidation method was used for phytolith extraction. Occluded carbon was determined by element analyzer.
   Our results showed that the soil PhytOC density (SPCD) ranged from 0.757 to 23.110 g/m(2) among different soil profiles. The SPCD of profiles in the Southern CLP was generally higher than that in the Northern CLP. It was estimated that 5.35 Mt of PhytOC was stored in the upper soil of the CLP. We also estimated the annual phytolith flux into the Yellow River from the CLP by soil erosion and about 2.5 Mt of phytoliths eroded and transported into rivers per year.
   Our study indicated that PhytOC was one of the potential biosequestration way and phytoliths had an important influence on biogeochemical cycle of silica. Our results suggested that the soil PhytOC was mainly influenced by different plant communities.

AB  - Meiobenthic fauna is complex and essential part of the stream benthos and it is known as intermediaries from bacteria to higher trophic levels. However, the dynamics and mechanisms regulating this community at small-scale largely have been neglected. This study was carried out to determine meiofaunal dynamics in a small scale-patterns influenced by flow velocity and other abiotic and biotic factors. We examined meiofauna within bryophytes on a tufa barrier in Plitvice Lakes National Park using a detailed taxonomic approach of various meiofaunal groups and their feeding guilds. We choose three microhabitats (slow, medium, fast) differing significantly in flow velocity above bryophytes. Bdelloid rotifers were the most abundant group in microhabitat with highest flow velocity, while in other two microhabitats nematodes and monogonont rotifers prevailed in abundance. Data on environmental variables and main meiofaunal taxa and feeding guilds were analyzed using redundancy analysis. This analysis indicated that microfilter feeding guild (e.g. bdelloid rotifers) was strongly affected by interaction of flow velocity and POM fractions. Other feeding guilds were influenced by temperature, oxygen and/or pH and did not prefer high flow velocity. Suction-feeder nematodes and microfilter-feeder rotifers were dominant on temporal and spatial scale, indicating their good adaptations on frequently disturbed conditions that prevailed on bryophyte covered tufa barrier. Our results provide comprehensive survey of diversity, density as well as trophic structure of meiofauna in aquatic bryophytes. Differences in meiofaunal composition and density between three microhabitats suggest that the meiofauna is relevant indicator of environmental changes even at small-scale pattern.

AB  - Objectives: We assessed the impact of a high frequency, functionally significant allelic variant of the progesterone receptor gene (PROGINS) on endometrial function and menstrual cycle characteristics. Further we asked whether PROGINS moderates the impact of life history characteristics, anthropometric measures, and physical activity on endometrial function.
   Methods: Fifty-two women were genotyped for the PROGINS variant, provided life history information, and had anthropometric measurements made. Women monitored their menstrual bleeding for three cycles, performed mid-cycle urinary ovulation tests, and recorded physical activity. A subset of women provided daily saliva samples and had mid-luteal endometrial thickness measurements taken during the third menstrual cycle. Salivary progesterone was assayed using ELISAs. The direct impact of PROGINS on endometrial and menstrual cycle characteristics was determined via independent t-tests with Bonferroni correction. Interactions between PROGINS and covariates were assessed by moderated regression.
   Results: PROGINS did not directly impact any indicator of endometrial function. However, PROGINS caused an increase in menstrual cycle length with increasing mid-luteal progesterone levels; the opposite relationship was present in noncarriers (P < 0.05). Additionally, PROGINS interacted with four of six anthropometric measures (BMI, waist circumference, height, and waist-hip ratio) to impact endometrial function, however, interactions between PROGINS and life history variables, or physical activity was limited.
   Conclusions: The gene x environment interactions we report suggest that PROGINS alters endometrial sensitivity to maternal energetic condition. Thus, the possibility of genetically-based variation in sensitivity to energetic stress should be considered in future adaptive models of women's reproduction. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 25:681-694, 2013.

AB  - The variability of indicator bacteria over a fine resolution time scale on the order of minutes has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we collected more than 700 Escherichia coli samples at a 10- and 30-min resolution in an urban watershed in Houston. A Bacteria Diurnal Sag (BDS) marked with daytime exponential decay followed by an exponential nighttime regeneration was observed. This pattern was observed during all sampled events but varied depending on other variables. The concentrations during a 24-h period varied 1 to 5 orders of magnitude and the fecal load was at least 10 times lower than what would be obtained using a single morning E. coli measurement, the typical sampling scheme in most monitoring programs. Decay rates, ranging from 3.67 to 24.7/day, decreased E. coli concentrations to below the water-quality standards from 14: 00 to 18: 00 h and were strongly influenced by water temperatures and solar radiation intensities. Rapid regeneration occurred on the order of 9.41 to 64.1/day allowing E. coli concentrations to return to their pre-decay levels. The data indicated that four to six samples taken between 06: 00 and 18: 00 h may be sufficient to define the BDS depending on stream conditions, and that a threshold concentration of approximately 100 MPN/dl (most probable number in a deciliter) existed for the studied urban watershed. These findings have significant implications for water-quality monitoring, regulation, and compliance.

AB  - The objective of this study is to discuss the role of networks formed of waste-picker cooperatives in ameliorating problems of final disposal of solid waste in the city of Rio de Janeiro, since the city's main landfill will soon have to close because of exhausted capacity. However, it is estimated that in the city of Rio de Janeiro there are around five thousand waste-pickers working in poor conditions, with lack of physical infrastructure and training, but contributing significantly by diverting solid waste from landfills. According to the Sustainable Development Indicators (IBGE, 2010a,b) in Brazil, recycling rates hover between 45% and 55%. In the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, only 1% of the waste produced is collected selectively by the government (COMLURB, 2010), demonstrating that recycling is mainly performed by waste-pickers. Furthermore, since the recycling market is an oligopsony that requires economies of scale to negotiate directly with industries, the idea of working in networks of cooperatives meets the demands for joint marketing of recyclable materials. Thus, this work presents a method for creating and structuring a network of recycling cooperatives, with prior training for working in networks, so that the expected synergies and joint efforts can lead to concrete results. We intend to demonstrate that it is first essential to strengthen the waste-pickers' cooperatives in terms of infrastructure, governance and training so that solid waste management can be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - In South Africa, the relative extent of range degradation under freehold compared with communal tenure has been debated. This study presents findings from a released communal area, where a former freehold farm was transferred to communal ownership in 1976 and compares this with an ecologically similar farm still under freehold tenure. Analysis of historical aerial photographs demonstrated an increase of 21.5?per cent in shrub abundance at the communal site after change from freehold tenure (19751985), but a slight decline of 0.3?per cent in the years preceding the change (19681975). Conversely, at the freehold site, shrub abundance declined by 12.8?per cent over the period 1968 to 2004. Field measurements revealed significantly (p?<?0.05) greater frequency of both woody and dwarf shrubs under communal tenure as well as significantly lower basal cover for all ground vegetation. Mean point to tuft distance values were also significantly lower at the communal site for both grasses and all ground vegetation. However, mean range condition score was significantly (p?=?0.03) higher at the communal site because of the significantly (p?=?0.01) greater frequency of Themeda triandra. We conclude that although the communal site does show some evidence of vegetation degradation relative to the freehold farm, range productivity has not declined in the short term, suggesting that more permanent range degradation at the site has been limited. A more conclusive evaluation of the link between tenure change and range degradation will require longer-term research at released sites, including measurement of established degradation indicators such as soil erosion.

AB  - Mud crabs (Scylla spp.) are a high value commodity harvested in the Indo-West Pacific. Scylla species support important artisanal fisheries in south-east Asia and intensive commercial fisheries in Australia where the market demand and catch has increased markedly over the last decade. Over-fishing of Scylla spp. has been observed at varying levels throughout its distribution. Fluctuations in catch rates and abundance are thought to be driven by climate parameters. Here we analyse monthly, seasonal and annual patterns in catch and effort data (from 1990 to 2008) for the commercial giant mud crab (Scylla serrata) fishery in the Northern Territory, Australia, with corresponding climatic data (rainfall, freshwater runoff, sea surface temperature) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) as an indicator of La Nina/El Nino events. Between 30 and 40% of the variation in catch per unit effort can be explained by rainfall and SOI alone. This result was supported by linear mixed models which identified SOI as the main contributor to the model. Spectral analyses showed that catch peaks coincided with a four year La Nina cycle. One- and two-year time lags (consistent with S. Serrata's life cycle) were also significantly correlated to SOI values and rainfall. These outcomes may assist fishery managers in planning fishing exposure period and duration. Furthermore, findings of this study provide information on the vulnerability of S. serrata to fluctuations in environmental conditions and can help to apply protective measures when and where necessary.

AB  - Meteorological parameters have a crucial influence on grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) production quantity and quality. Most of the commonly used bioclimatic indices are not appropriate to represent intravineyard micrometeorological variability, in particular the subdaily dynamics that are important in grape maturation processes. The aim of this research was to compile a new set of micrometeorological indices and evaluate their capacity to discriminate the differences in the microclimatic daily cycle induced by different canopy management techniques, based on a statistical data set of three years (2008, 2009, 2010) of hourly data of cluster internal temperature, canopy air temperature, and solar radiation intercepted by the cluster. Data was collected in four vineyards planted with Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, located in three climatic zones of Tuscany (Italy). Starting from this data set, some new micrometeorological indices were defined using two different criteria for subdaily time segmentation: static, based on fixed hourly intervals, and dynamic, based on solar height daytime segmentation. Results showed that indices based on subdaily data better provide a better representation of vineyard microclimate than daily indices and are able to highlight microclimatic differences induced by canopy management practices. The indices more sensitive to treatments are those related to the solar radiation intercepted by the cluster parameter and relative to the Broad Daylight Index, which represent the average of micrometeorological parameters in the middle hours of the day. The proposed indices enhance the characterization of micrometeorological conditions induced by different canopy management practices and, therefore, the assessment of the within-vineyard spatial variability of environmental parameters.

AB  - This work presents observations of diurnal-inertial motions forced by a sea-land breeze regime near critical latitudes (30 degrees +/- 10 degrees N/S) for resonance on the Portuguese shelf. Wind conditions were determined with an Aanderaa meteorological buoy placed in the Bay of Setubal during the Maritime Rapid Environmental Assessment 2004 (MREA04) sea trial. Currents data for this period were recorded from two Barny ADCP (acoustic Doppler current profiler) deployments located on the north and south sides of the bay, respectively. Both ADCPs covered almost the full depth of water (112 m) with 24 bins of 4 m size at both sites. Dominant motions exhibited a two-layer configuration in response to energetic out-of-phase oscillations driven by diurnal-inertial currents. Hence, simultaneous CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) data were considered to assess the strength of observed motions in promoting diapycnal mixing. With this aim, ADCP and CTD data were used to analyse the vertical shear (S-2), squared buoyancy frequency (N-2) and gradient Richardson number (Ri) of the water column in terms of two main layers with highly stratified and vertically sheared flows during diurnal-inertial events. Observations show a strong variation in the vertical density field near both ADCP deployments that involved high vertical shears distributed into two layers associated with diurnal-inertial currents. The results of our analysis highlight the role of wind-forced diurnal-inertial motions in shelf areas near the critical latitudes, where they can greatly contribute to triggering diapycnal mixing at the scale of a few days, owing to sea-land breeze forcing.

AB  - Partial order tools can be used in multiple criteria analysis to prioritize and rank a set of objects. In this setting the starting point is generally a matrix M-nxk, of k observed indicators on n objects. Given that indicators are measured at least at the ordinal level, from matrix M its corresponding partially ordered set - poset - is set up to form the basis of multi-criteria ranking. The partial order may be very complex even when the number of objects to be compared is relatively small. The reason of such complexity is often due to the intrinsic nature of partial order which is exclusively based on the ordinal properties of the data matrix. Incomparabilities between objects can be due even to very small differences in the observed values of indicators thus causing 'irrelevant' incomparabilities. Also, objects may have been characterized with a redundant set of variables so that the change in the values of some indicators should not seriously affect the structure of the poset. These two opposite conditions are directly linked to the indicator level of influence and call for an indicator value related sensitivity analysis for testing the robustness of posets. In this work we propose a method to carry out a sensitivity analysis for posets by using variance-based sensitivity indices to detect main effects and interactions between indicators. To this aim, we characterize the poset structure with scalar measures and compute variance-based sensitivity indices according to the most recent practice for a fully exploratory sensitivity analysis. These indices allow for detecting least and most influencing indicators. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The origin, depositional environment and maturity of petroleum source rocks were determined via conventional whole rock and biomarker analysis of samples from wells in the Banat Depression, where the most important Serbian oil and gas fields are located. The organic matter (OM) in organic-rich upper Tertiary siltstones and marls consists predominantly of Type II kerogen. Numerous biomarker parameters indicated mixed algal-terrestrial OM, related to a brackish or freshwater environment, whose salinity decreased from Middle to Upper Miocene. The OM was deposited under variable redox conditions, reducing to sub-oxic.
   The wells in the Banat Depression experienced variable high rates of rapid heating, providing an opportunity for examining the applicability of different thermal indicators in a hyperthermal basin. Rock-Eval and numerous biomarker parameters indicate that the main stage of oil generation begins at ca. 130 degrees C and vitrinite reflectance (Rc) ca. 0.63% and reaches a maximum at ca. 145-150 degrees C and Rc ca. 0.72-0.75%, while the late stage of oil generation starts at ca. 155 degrees C and ca. Rc 0.78%, which corresponds, depending on geothermal gradient, to relative depths of 2100-2300 m, 2600-2900 m and 3050-3100 m, respectively. The naphthalene and phenanthrene maturity parameters proved to be less applicable than the biomarker ratios, particularly in the early to moderate maturation range. The newly proposed parameter C(14a)-homo-26-nor-17 alpha(H)-hopane/C(30)hopane (C30HH/C30H) proved applicable to a wide range of maturity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we developed a novel method of acid-base titration, viz. the electromigration acid-base titration (EABT), via a moving neutralization boundary (MNR). With HCl and NaOH as the model strong acid and base, respectively, we conducted the experiments on the EABT via the method of moving neutralization boundary for the first time. The experiments revealed that (i) the concentration of agarose gel, the voltage used and the content of background electrolyte (KCl) had evident influence on the boundary movement; (ii) the movement length was a function of the running time under the constant acid and base concentrations; and (iii) there was a good linearity between the length and natural logarithmic concentration of HCl under the optimized conditions, and the linearity could be used to detect the concentration of acid. The experiments further manifested that (i) the RSD values of intra-day and inter-day runs were less than 1.59 and 3.76%, respectively, indicating similar precision and stability in capillary electrophoresis or HPLC; (ii) the indicators with different pK(a) values had no obvious effect on EABT, distinguishing strong influence on the judgment of equivalence-point titration in the classic one; and (iii) the constant equivalence-point titration always existed in the EABT, rather than the classic volumetric analysis. Additionally, the EABT could be put to good use for the determination of actual acid concentrations. The experimental results achieved herein showed a new general guidance for the development of classic volumetric analysis and element (e. g. nitrogen) content analysis in protein chemistry.

AB  - A sulfate rich Quaternary urban aquifer is contaminated with a variety of different petroleum hydrocarbons. To reveal the details of the sulfur cycling and to prove the occurrence of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR), as one major process of anaerobic biodegradation, geochemical and isotope investigations of different dissolved (sulfate and sulfide) and reduced inorganic sedimentary sulfur compounds (monosulfide, disulfide, and elemental sulfur) were conducted. In order to recognize possible biodegradation, the carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon was examined as well.
   The local significant depletion of (13)C in DIC is a first indicator for the occurrence of biodegradation at the site. The enrichment of both heavy sulfur and heavy oxygen isotopes in dissolved sulfate and the simultaneous decrease of sulfate concentrations at several sampling locations provide clear evidence for the occurrence of BSR in the aquifer. The isotope distribution pattern of sulfate suggests a straightforward bacterial reduction process. However, the isotopic composition of dissolved sulfide indicates the occurrence of secondary processes superimposed on BSR.
   Primary or secondary pyrite is the dominant sedimentary sulfur species in the aquifer matrix. The ubiquitous occurrence of sedimentary monosulfide is further evidence for the important role of BSR. However, the presence of elemental sulfur and the isotope distribution pattern of sedimentary sulfur species point to a temporal variability of the hydrochemical conditions at the site with the occurrence of secondary sulfur transformations such as partial re-oxidation. Nevertheless, isotope and hydrochemical data indicate an overall high natural attenuation potential of the investigated aquifer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents results from a site characterization and monitoring study at Karaduvar area (Mersin, SE Turkey), where high concentrations of refined petroleum products have been detected in domestic and irrigation water wells. The saturated and unsaturated zones in the deltaic aquifer are contaminated by large quantities of gasoline and diesel range fuel hydrocarbons (GRHs and DRHs) released from diverse sources that include accidental spills, storage tank fires, pipeline breaks, deliberate discharge of waste petroleum products from slop tanks and illegal tanker truck washing facilities. At the site, due to the complex nature of the pollution sources, overlapping contaminant plumes exist and cover an area of about 0.5 km(2). In both polluted and unpolluted parts of the aquifer, monitoring of groundwater physicochemical parameters in a total of 55 sampling points was carried out between 2006 and 2007. The results show that the terminal electron acceptors (e. g. dissolved oxygen, nitrate, Mn(IV), Fe(III), sulfate) were reduced near the source area(s) indicating presence of actively operating biodegradation processes at the site. Close to the contaminant source area(s), conditions in the plume are highly anoxic and reducing; where high amounts of transformation products (e. g. bicarbonate, dissolved iron, and manganese) are present in solution. Additionally, at the site, excessive pumping, careless land use, and deliberate wastewater discharges significantly deteriorated the quality and quantity of groundwater. Excessive groundwater pumping for industrial and agricultural uses has resulted in substantial water level declines (2-3 m) near the coastal part where seawater intrusion threatens the groundwater resources.

AB  - Forty sediment samples and fifteen water samples were collected from the Gulf of Thermaikos and the Bay of Thessaloniki in order to determine the concentration of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cr and measure various seawater parameters. The level of pollution attributed to heavy metals was evaluated using several pollution indicators in order to determine anthropogenically derived sediment contamination. Enrichment Factors, Contamination Factors. Modified Contamination Degree, and Geoaccumulation Indexes for the sediments were used to assess and visualize using GIS. Association with adverse effects to aquatic organisms was determined, using the classification of the sediments according to the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs). The highest metal levels were concentrated along the shoreline of the Bay of Thessaloniki, reflecting long-term exposure to anthropogenic activities. Enrichment Factors reveal the anthropogenic sources for chromium and lead. This is supported by separate Contamination Factors, the mean Contamination Degree, and the Geoaccumulation Index. The majority of the sediment samples can be occasionally and frequently associated to toxic biological effects, according to the effect-range classification for Zn, Cu and Pb. Based on the analysis of the overlying seawater columns it appears that under the present physicochemical conditions, dissolution of the accumulated metals from the sediments is unlikely. Although the total metal content in the sediments has decreased with time, the long-term effect of the industrial and urban activities in the area is still reflected in sediments from the gulf (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The amphipod Talorchestia longicornis is active on the substrate surface during the night and inactive in its burrows during the day. The underlying circadian rhythm in activity can be entrained by the light : dark cycle. This study considered other aspects of entrainment, such as: whether the compound eyes or extraocular photoreceptors are used to detect entrainment cues, which visual pigment mediates the entrainment process, whether entrainment can also occur in response to diel temperature cycles and whether when presented with conflicting entrainment cues, the light : dark or temperature cycle dominates for entrainment. Entrainment was determined by monitoring temporal changes in surface activity using a video system, and assessed as the number of animals active on a sand substrate at 0.5 h intervals. The compound eyes and not extraocular photoreceptors are used for entrainment to the light : dark cycle. Although T. longicornis has two visual pigments with absorption maxima near 420 and 520 nm, entrainment occurred only by light that simulated the 520 nm absorbing pigment, perhaps because its absorption is matched to the spectrum of ambient light at twilight. The rhythm is also entrained by a diel temperature cycle. If amphipods are simultaneously exposed to a temperature and light : dark cycles phased differently, they entrain to the temperature cycle. These results suggest that for a burrowing amphipod, diel temperature cycles may be a more reliable indicator of environmental conditions than light cycles.

AB  - Soil Fe oxides Occur in almost all soils and reflect different environmental conditions by the high variability of their mineralogy and concentration. Quantitatively determining this important pedogenic indicator enables diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) based on material-specific absorption characteristics. This paper presents a methodology that directly links free Fe oxide content (Fe-d, citrate-dithionite extractable Fe) with the diagnostic Fe absorption band near 900 nm (Fe-NIR). In addition, we investigated the influence of soil texture on the spectral characteristics and prediction accuracy. We showed that the Fe absorption bands of clay-dominated soil samples were, in general, deeper than sand-dominated samples with comparable Fe-d content. Based on the Fe-NIR absorption depth, we created two texture-dependent Fe-d prediction models, retrieving the best Fe-d estimates for the sand calibrated model (R-v(2) = 0.87, rel. MSEv = 13.9%). Due to the high texture variability in sand, silt, and clay fractions of the clay-silt dominated samples, the clay-silt calibrated model produced good predictions (R-v(2) = 0.70, rel. RMSEv = 19.0%). The soil texture appeared to have no significant influence on model stability but did affect the prediction accuracy. Constant Fe-d contents were over- and underestimated when applying the texture-dependent models to other texture groups. The texture-independent model was stable and performed well (R-v(2) = 0.76, rel. RMSEv = 18.1%). These results are highly relevant to the subsequent spatial assessment of free Fe oxide content as an indicator for soil development from hyperspectral remote sensing data.

AB  - In contrast to the last century, where more people used to live in rural areas, at present, more than half of the world's population lives in urban settlements. Hence, the 21st century is the century of the cities and of urbanization. The rapid urbanization process experienced by the majority of developing countries during the last few decades has resulted in fundamental changes to the environment and to the social structure. In most of the megacities that have grown to unprecedented size, the pace of urbanization has far exceeded the growth of necessary infrastructure and services. In order to carry out the urban planning and development tasks necessary to improve the living conditions for the poorest world-wide, a detailed spatial data basis is required. Due to the high dynamics of megacities, traditional methods such as statistical analyses or fieldwork are limited to capture the urban process. Remote sensing provides the opportunity to monitor spatial patterns of urban structures with high spatial and temporal resolution. The present study investigates the potential to use very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing data to identify urban structures and dynamics within Delhi, India. The paper presents a semi-automated, object-oriented classification approach which allows for the identification of informal settlements within the urban area. In order to provide indicators to identify socio-economic structures and their dynamics, the image classification results are embedded in an integrative analysis concept. Information on population and water related parameters are derived. This is understood to be a first step to the development of indicators which will help to identify and understand the different shapes', actors, and processes in megacities.

AB  - Water resources attributes can be parameterized into water quality indicators that also describe the impact of agriculture on the biophysical and socio-economic processes in the environment. This article is a sequel to a previous paper published by the authors that presented a water resources hazard assessment decision support system (DSS). The geographical information system (GIS) functionality of the original DSS has been advanced for mapping, spatial and geostatistical analysis of water resources hazards, water use/management practice classification and best water management practice identification. The interactive mapping potential enables the users to broaden water resource management and investigate spatial and temporal trends in water hazard status. The output includes a host of thematic maps and water use matrices. The improvement of the DSS by integration of GIS has enhanced its ability to support land and water use decision-making at farm and catchment levels by not only setting best water use guidelines but also suggesting where they are most appropriate. The improved version of the DSS has been recalibrated, tested and applied to land and water use data from the Kusa area in Kenya. The system assists land and water use planning through the evaluation of sustainability of water resources, identifying environmental issues concerning future water use sites and defining the conditions for use of present water resources. It can be used to evaluate hazards and environmental threats to other agricultural land resources. The current paper presents a documentation of the water hazard management system and a description of its application to be a requisite of water hazards in the study area.

AB  - An important goal of regional development in the Brazilian Amazon was to enhance social welfare and alleviate dire poverty in other parts of the country by providing land to the poor. Nevertheless, both poverty and landlessness have persisted despite development policies that distributed billions of dollars on highway construction, loans, and outright subsidies. Inequitable land distribution has been held as a prime factor in land conflict across the country. Although episodes of conflict over land are common in Brazilian history, this paper focuses on agrarian issues that arose with the opening of the Amazon frontier in the 1970s. The paper presents a political economy approach that considers the role of hierarchical forces interacting across spatial scales, in creating conditions ripe for land conflict at the local level. The premise is that the Brazilian government, intending to bring about economic and social development, promoted contradictory strategies creating land scarcity. These strategies led to expansion of large ranching operations, creation of conservation units, and demarcation of indigenous reserves, which constrained the pool of land available for small farmer settlement. Empirical analysis employing regression and spatial statistics is used to test the proposed model, advancing previous efforts by applying spatial regression, incorporating improved indicators of conflict and explanatory variables generated by a Geographic Information System (GIS). The findings provide support for some elements of the argument, demonstrating statistically significant relationships between land conflict and land concentration, cattle ranching, and road construction. Finally, a case study analysis of a county in the heart of the land conflict zone is provided, illustrating the interaction of scalar forces, and the articulation of land conflict at the local level.

AB  - It is known that habitats composed of spatially heterogeneous abiotic conditions provide a great diversity of potentially suitable niches for plant species. The scientific premises of landscape ecology suggest that, at a higher spatial level, also the composition and structure of the landscape mosaic, influences biotic processes and hence species richness. In this exploratory study we investigated if plant species diversity could be correlated with landscape structure and complexity indices which were based on Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Plant species data were derived from the 4 km x 4 km resolution Flora Database of Flanders (i.e. northern Belgium). Plant species number within the 4 km x 4 km grid cells was positively correlated with most of the landscape diversity indices whereas landscape fragmentation indices only affected the group of the threatened species. We found a gradient of increasing species richness beginning from the rural areas of Flanders over the suburban towards the urban areas. This gradient was mostly due to the higher number of alien plant species, warmth indicators and threatened species in urbanised areas. We conclude that, at least in the studied region, the effects of landscape changes on plant species diversity can be monitored and predicted on a large scale and over long periods of time using land cover data. Bottleneck in this kind of analyses remains the reliability of the land cover data and the availability and reliability of the biological data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the research was to evaluate rearing efficiency of slaughter turkey-hens. The control group (IV) was fed on standard all-mash feed which contained feed antibiotic. The other groups (I-III) were fed on feed which did not contain the antibiotic growth stimulator but included differentiated content of Biostrong-500 herbal nutrient.
   The turkey-hens were reared for 15 weeks in the same environmental conditions on deep litter in a room without windows. After 15 weeks blood was taken from 8 turkey-hens (from each group) in order to carry out a biochemical examination of the blood serum. The body weight of the control group IV (8731 g) was similar to the weight of the experimental groups (8740-8900 g). The feed consumption per 1 kg of the body weight was also at a similar level and amounted to 2.78 kg in the control group-IV and 2.66-2.82 kg in the groups additionally fed on Biostrong-500 nutrient. The rearing efficiency index (REI) was slightly higher in groups I-III and amounted to 304-292 points, and 291 points in the control group (IV). The results of the biochemical blood examination were differentiated. An essentially higher content of cholesterol and triglicerides was noticed in the blood serum of control group IV (181.2 mg/dl and 81.0 mg/dl).
   The production results and biochemical indicators of the blood serum reveal the possibility of feeding slaughter turkey-hens on mixed feeds which do not contain the antibiotic growth stimulator but contain Biostrong-500 herbal nutrient (500 g/t of the mixed feed).

AB  - The unique database of water quality measurements made in the Seine estuary over 45 years by the Service de la Navigation de la Seine at Rouen is used here to reconstruct the evolution of oxygen status in the estuary and the nutrient fluxes to the Seine Bight during the last half century. The Riverstrahler model is used to establish the link between these long-term trends in the functioning of the Seine system and the evolution of agricultural, domestic, and industrial activity in the watershed over this period taking into account natural and man-induced hydrological variations. Oxygenation of the fluvial sector below Paris has increased considerably owing to improved wastewater treatment, but a large part of the estuary remains completely anoxic during the spring and summer months. Nitrogen input to surface waters from urban sources has remained essentially constant while diffuse inputs from agricultural soils have increased 5-fold as a result of more intensive agricultural practices as well as the loss of retention capacity in riparian zones. Phosphorus inputs from domestic and industrial sources increased 3-fold from 1950 to 1980, but have decreased gradually in recent years. The generally Wgh level of phosphorus contamination has favored strong algal development in all large tributaries of the Seine River upstream of Paris since the 1960s. Silica inputs, originating mainly from the weathering of rocks, fluctuate widely depending on hydrology. In-stream retention of silica, linked to diatom blooms, has increased but remains limited. These changes have induced several shifts in the nutrient limitation conditions of the Seine Bight.

AB  - Neoproterozoic to subtrilobite Cambrian strata in the Mackenzie Mountains, Canada, provide a test case for the current paradigm of evolutionary stages in the development of the early infauna. Three predominantly siliciclastic formations (Ingta, Backbone Ranges, and Vampire formations) collectively exhibit 13 facies associations representing nonmarine to distal shelf environments, and can, be subdivided into 18 simple sequences, each of 800,000-1,000,000 years duration. Trace fossil occurrences were digitized at the level of simple sequences and plotted on a matrix with facies associations (environment) on the x-axis and simple sequences (time) on the y-axis. This analysis shows that evolution was a first-order control on trace fossil distribution, and that environmental factors exerted an important second-order control. Trace fossils were most abundant in normal marine environments and Less so in marginal-marine settings with fluctuating or brackish salinity. Eolian and fresh-water deposits were barren, presumably because animals able to tolerate these conditions had not evolved. Turbulence excluded organisms from shoreface environments. Several biostratigraphically important ichnotaxa (e.g., Treptichnus and Rusophycus) however, show broad environmental tolerance across the marine shelf: Taphonomic factors led to fine preservation in interbedded sandstone-mudstone facies, but to diagenetic obliteration of trace fossils in most carbonate facies. Trace fossils provide a consistent indicator of the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian boundary Four evolutionary zones can be recognized: (I) Simple burrows, (II) Treptichnuspedum Zone, (III) Rusophycus avalonensis Zone, and (IV) Cruziana tenella Zone. Global biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic correlations imply that Zone I is terminal Neoproterozoic and the overlying three zones subtrilobite Cambrian in age. These zones are present in, the Newfoundland Neoproterozoic-Cambrian boundary GSSP, the East European Platform, and elsewhere.

AB  - have previously characterized the processing of secretogranin II (SgII) in PC12 cells that were stably transfected with the endopeptidase PC2. Here we show that processing of SgII can be observed in isolated immature secretory granules (ISGs) derived from this cell line in a temperature- and ATP-dependent manner. The stimulatory effect of ATP on processing can be attributed to the activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase and a concomitant decrease in intragranular pH. The immature secretory granule therefore provides an adequate environment for correct processing of SgII by PC2. The rate of SgII processing was strongly dependent on the intragranular pH, suggesting that processing of SgII can be used as a pH indicator for the granule interior. A standard curve was prepared using SgII processing in ISGs equilibrated at a range of pH values. The extent of processing in ISGs incubated in the presence of ATP at physiological pH was compared with the standard curve, and the intragranular pH was determined. From these observations, we propose an intragranular pH of 6.3+/-0.1 for ISGs in a physiological buffer in the presence of ATP. Hence, the pH of ISGs seems to be similar to the pH of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is clearly higher than the pH of mature secretory granules (pH 5.0-5.5). Interestingly, no processing of SgII could be observed in a membrane fraction that is highly enriched in TGN under conditions for which processing was readily obtained in isolated ISGs.

AB  - Natural toxins are found widespread from animal, plant and micro-organism sources. Presented here in review are recently discovered natural protein toxins that have in some way been shown to affect the permeability of the cutaneous micro-vasculature, or skin capillaries.
   Capillaries play a major role in the body by controlling the necessary normal balance of metabolites in the body's tissues and that of the blood. The trans-capillary exchanges of water and metabolites are regulated by the basal lamina, the internal activities of the endothelial cells and the driving forces on each side of the capillary wall. Edema, inflammation, urticaria, increased capillary permeability and cutaneous edema are conditions that are related. The main methods for detecting the increase in skin capillary permeability have been by using the rat paw edema assay, labelled albumin, or other detectable indicators.
   Natural venoms and toxins sources causing edema include mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, plants, and micro-organisms. Not all the substances causing increased capillary permeability are proteins such as certain alkaloids (Plants, fungi, fire ants and others) and normal endogenous substances e.g. histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, (plants, snakes, and others) and are not considered in this review.
   Recently, a large number of toxins (predominantly bacterial toxins) have been reported that produce increased cutaneous capillary permeability, some of which are known in some detail and selected toxins are discussed.
   These studies have helped to understand the toxins, provided for more effective treatments, and helped to improve our knowledge of the capillaries and endothelial cells.

AB  - Accessibility of freshwater in remote rural regions where the demand is merely of the order of 1 to 100 m3/d is limited. Low-cost freshwater productivity in those regions can be fulfilled by simple solar stills with inexpensive carbon particle dispersions to enhance the absorption of solar energy near the evaporating surface. In this manuscript, the techno-economic and environmental assessment of such a solar still with low-cost nanoparticle dispersion is performed for two rural coastal locations of Big Sur (U.S.A) in northern hemisphere and Chan similar to aral (Chile) in southern hemisphere and compared against competing solar desalination technologies, that is, solar collector integrated humidification dehumidification (FPC- HDH) and photo-voltaic seawater reverse osmosis (PV-SWRO) system. Real time year-round solar irradiation and ambient conditions data are utilized for the energy analysis. The expected daily freshwater productivity is around 3.5 and 5 m3/d for a 1000 m2 solar still and FPC-HDH system. For similar rates of freshwater productivity, 200 m2 PV-SWRO system is sufficient. The annual greenhouse gas emissions mitigated by thermal systems was around 200 ton/y, while for PV-SWRO was only 50 ton/d. Economic analysis showed cost of freshwater production with solar still to be lower than PV-SWRO at around $8/m3. A feasibility analysis of low-cost parameters showed that the unit cost of freshwater can be lower than $3/m3 with solar stills, which is much lower than PV-SWRO system.

AB  - Cyprus is one of the few areas of the Mediterranean where lower and upper Miocene coral-reefs occur in close proximity and is thus well suited to investigate how environmental and geological changes affected the reefs and their associated shallow-marine facies. The prevailing environmental conditions of the lower Miocene Terra Member and of the upper Miocene Koronia Member are reconstructed here, using detailed microfacies comparisons of the skeletal, foraminiferal and calcareous algal assemblages. The lower Miocene reefs are characterised by a higher biodiversity of coralline algae, large benthic foraminifera and corals, and mainly developed in slightly deeper water (20-40 m, lower euphotic zone) than the upper Miocene reefs (< 15 m; upper euphotic zone). The reduced late Miocene biodiversity was probably caused by changes in the Mediterranean marine environment (e.g. increased seasonality), possibly in response to global cooling, increased latitudinal gradients and progressive isolation of the basin. The observed shift of the reef environment towards the upper euphotic zone could be explained as a response to late Miocene physical oceanographic setting, notably temperature changes, which could have made the upper euphotic zone more favourable for certain hermatypic corals. Similarities between the Miocene carbonate facies of Cyprus and the Eratosthenes Seamount directly to the south, and elsewhere in the Mediterranean region (e.g., Corsica; Italy; Spain), suggest that the environmental changes inferred for the Miocene of Cyprus operated on a Mediterranean or even wider scale.

AB  - Wind energy is one of the most promising solutions to energy crisis and environmental pollution, so it is being developed rapidly. Wind turbine power curves (WTPCs) play an important role in wind energy assessment, turbine condition monitoring, and power grid dispatching. However, there are two challenges in WTPC modeling: model selection and parameter optimization. Many parametric and non-parametric models have been developed to characterize WTPCs, but none can always perform the best due to the complex wind regimes. In this paper, considering the simple structure and interpretability of model parameters, a set of parametric WTPC models is constructed to adapt to the variability of wind regimes, and the optimal candidate will be selected from the set according to their performances. As to the process of parameter optimization, a novel loss function, which considers the asymmetric error characteristic of WTPC modeling, is proposed, and a hybrid intelligent optimization method named GWO-BSA, which makes full use of the advantages of grey wolf optimizer and backtracking search algorithm, is designed. Finally, a novel WTPC modeling strategy, which combines the candidate model set, error characteristic-based loss function, and GWO-BSA, is proposed to obtain better power curves. Experimental results show that (1) GWO-BSA shows faster convergence speed and higher optimization accuracy than single optimization algorithms; (2) the proposed error characteristic-based loss function has better performance than the commonly used symmetric loss functions; and (3) compared with some popular artificial intelligence-based models, the designed WTPC modeling strategy produces better WTPCs under different wind regimes.

AB  - Carbon emissions from tourism are an important indicator to measure the impact of tourism on environmental quality. As the world's largest industry, tourism has many related industries and is a strong driver of energy consumption. The emission reductions it can achieve will directly determine whether China's overall carbon emission reduction target can be met. This paper analyzes the drivers of the evolution of carbon emissions from the tourism industry in China over the period 2000-2017 as a research sample using the Generalized Dividing Index Method (GDIM), and on this basis, it uses scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation to predict the carbon peak in tourism for the first time. The research results show that the scale of industry and energy consumption are the key factors leading to increased tourism carbon emissions, and the carbon intensity of tourism industry, energy consumption carbon intensity, investment efficiency, and energy intensity are the main factors leading to reduced carbon emissions from tourism. The scale of investment and the carbon intensity of investment have a dual effect; the scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation used to predict peak carbon in China's tourism industry show that the peak carbon will occur approximately in 2030. The government needs to further guide and encourage the tourism industry to increase investment activities targeting energy conservation and emission reduction. Under the conditions of strictly implementing energy conservation and emission reduction measures and vigorous promotion of the transformation and upgrading of tourism development methods, the tourism industry will have considerable potential to reduce carbon emissions.

AB  - This paper presents a novel fractional-order PID plus derivative with filter coefficient (FOPID-DN) controller for automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system using the MATLAB/Simulink environment. An AVR system is employed in the power system to maintain the terminal voltage at the desired level. Parameters of the proposed FOPID-DN controller are optimally tuned by the recently developed Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) algorithm. Performance of the designed FOPID-DN controller for an AVR system is compared with various controllers which are optimally tuned by different optimization algorithms. Comparative transient response analysis of the proposed technique has been carried out by considering vital transient response indicators like maximum overshoot, rise time, and settling time. Performance analysis of the proposed technique for an AVR system has been done by considering several input conditions. Robustness analysis of the EO algorithm tuned FOPID-DN controller has been performed by varying the time constants of different components in an AVR system. The capability of the FOPID-DN controller to handle nonlinearities of an AVR system has been investigated. The stability of the FOPID-DN controlled AVR system has been analyzed. In addition, the disturbance rejection capability of the FOPID-DN controlled AVR system has also been investigated. From the various simulation results obtained using the MATLAB/Simulink environment, it has been observed that the proposed FOPID-DN-based AVR system provided better performance as compared to different existing controllers.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising conversion technology in algae biofuel research due to its ability to agnostically convert proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids to biocrude. The high-temperature conditions that define this conversion process require the material to maintain a subcritical liquid state, which complicates the assessment of accurate thermochemical properties due to the required pressure. To clarify this issue, this work compares the estimated performance of algal hydrothermal liquefaction between different thermodynamic models. A process model was developed in Aspen Plus from a robust assessment of current literature. Technoeconomic assessment and life-cycle assessment metrics are derived from this model and used as key performance indicators. The baseline fuel price contribution of hydrothermal liquefaction is $0.45 per liter gasoline equivalent. Independently decreasing the temperature from 350 degrees C to 260 degrees C while maintaining yield reduces the conversion cost by 19%, illustrating the importance of understanding the high-temperature thermodynamics of the system. Different thermodynamic property models can vary fuel conversion cost results by $0.07 per liter gasoline equivalent. The baseline global warming potential is +23 g CO2 eq MJ(-1) and the net energy ratio is 0.30. Environmental metrics beyond global warming potential and net energy ratio are also discussed for the first time. Uncertainties in conversion performance are bounded through a scenario analysis that manipulates parameters such as product yield and nutrient recycle to produce a range of economic and environmental metrics. The work is supplemented with an open source model to support future hydrothermal liquefaction assessments and accelerate the development of commercial-scale systems.

AB  - During the Permian period of the southern China North Plate, a layer of marine mudstone (source rock) with oil and gas potential has been widely deposited, with a thickness of about 10.4 m, but their formation mechanism remains unclear. Here, through the application of various analysis techniques, the mineral composition of the mudstone and a series of related geochemical data are obtained to investigate their sedimentary environment and tectonic setting. Mineral composition analysis describes that marine mudstone is mainly composed of quartz, illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and other silicate minerals, while carbonate components such as calcite are rare. Meanwhile, the higher content of clay minerals promoted the organic matter during the deposition period enrichment. Indicators and diagrams (i.e., chemical index of alteration [CIA] [> 80], index of compositional variability [ICV] [similar to 0.6], A-CN-K, Th/Sr vs. Zr/Sr) reveal that marine mudstone was deposited for the first time under strong weathering. Some trace element ratios and redox elements provide evidence that in warm and arid climates, mudstones are deposited under oxic-anoxic conditions based on the participation of seawater, which is consistent with the conclusion of palaeomagnetics. The binary discriminant diagrams of Al2O3 versus TiO2, Hf-La/Th versus Ni-TiO2 suggest that the marine mudstone parent rock is felsic igneous rock, and the lithology may be granite. Combining the regional structural evolution and the direction of transgression during the sedimentary period, it is speculated that the provenance of marine mudstone is the North Qinling tectonic belt in the southwest of the study area and the Yinshan ancient land in the north.

AB  - The source of marine oils from the deep Tarim Basin is still in debate due to several alteration processes of source indicators. A series of trimethyl-alkylbenzenes has been detected in marine oils from this old, composite basin, besides the reported aryl isoprenoids with 2,3,6-trimethyl substitution (AIPs). They are characterized by regular gas chromatography elution pattern, which is similar to that of n-alkylbenzenes, and suggest a strong possibility of n-alkyl side chains. C-15 trimethyl-n-alkylbenzenes were synthesized by Friedel-Crafts acylation of trimethylbenzene isomers to determine their structures. Based on the chromatography and mass spectra data and the coinjection of synthesized compounds, this series of compounds has been assigned as the 2,4,5-trimethyl-n-alkylbenzenes that coeluted with 2,3,5-trimethyl-n-alkylbenzenes, and other trimethyl-n-alkylbenzene isomers were also detected. This series of trimethyl-n-alkylbenzene (AAs) shows much higher relative abundances in light and waxy oils than in normal and heavy oils, which is opposite to the variation in relative abundances of aryl isoprenoids. The ratios of these trimethyl-n-alkylbenzenes to the aryl isoprenoids (AA/AIP ratio) generally show a good correlation with the maturity indicators for most of studied oils despite of some outliers (mainly condensates). The pyrolysis of asphaltenes has confirmed these trends. These results support an important control of thermal stress on the molecular compositions of marine oils from the deep Tarim Basin, besides other secondary alteration processes (such as oil mixing and migration fractionation, among others). These factors should be given a full consideration for the source determination of deep and ultradeep oils.

AB  - The restoration of ecosystems provides an important opportunity to improve the provision of ecosystem services. Achieving the maximum possible benefits from restoration with a limited budget requires knowing which places if restored would produce the best combination of improved ecosystem services. Using an ecosystem services assessment and optimization algorithm, we find choices that generate maximum benefits from ecosystem restoration. We applied a set of weights to integrate multiple services into a unified approach and find the optimal land restoration option given those weights. We then systematically vary the weights to find a Pareto frontier that shows potentially optimal choices and illustrates trade-offs among services. We applied this process to evaluate optimal restoration on Hainan Island, China, a tropical island characterized by multiple ecosystem service hotspots and conditions of poverty. We analyzed restoration opportunities with the goal of increasing a provisioning service, plantation revenue, and several water-related ecosystem services that contribute to improved water quality and flood mitigation. We found obvious spatial inconsistencies in the optimal location for maximizing separate services and tradeoffs in the provision of these services. Optimized land-use patterns greatly out-performed the non-target restoration scheme. When explicit consideration of the importance of poverty alleviation was taken into account, the location of the prioritized areas shifted and trade-offs among services varied. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating social concerns into land-use planning to mitigate conflicts and improve equity, especially in the areas where poverty and hotspots of biodiversity and ecosystem services are highly geographically coincident.

AB  - Generally water-wastewater systems in developed cities contribute significantly to public health. But, the related systems are resource intensive and lack circularity. Supplying and heating up drinking water as well as treating domestic wastewater are related to relatively high energy consumption and require a major infrastructure. However, there are potentials to reduce the environmental impacts of these systems by using the thermal and chemical energies and nutrients contained in the wastewater. If organic municipal waste is added the energy efficiency of the entire system could further enhanced.
   Using a regional Life Cycle Assessment approach, the overarching aim of the paper is to assess the environmental impacts of different systems alternatives which aim to increase the resource and energy efficiency by separating wastewater at the source in greywater and blackwater and co-digest the latter with organic municipal solid waste. The results are compared to an existing system of a German medium-sized urban neighborhood. The impacts assessed are two resource-related (fossil and metal depletion) and three emissions-related (climate change, photochemical oxidant formation and terrestrial acidification).
   Under the conditions of the settlement investigated, the discussed alternative systems show a noteworthy decline of the environmental impacts compared to the status quo: from -68.0 (metal depletion) up to -96.5% (climate change). Thus, even in existent settlements transforming the current linear system in a more circular one could be a promising strategy to enhance the resource efficiency of water-wastewater-waste-energy systems. A slight advantage of a "sewerless" system can be identified.

AB  - Studies on improving the adaptability of upper limb rehabilitation training do not often consider the implications of muscle fatigue sufficiently. In this study, electromyogram features were used as fatigue indicators in the context of human-robot interaction. They were utilised for auto-adaptation of the task difficulty, which resulted in a prolonged training interaction. The electromyogram data was collected from three gross-muscles of the upper limb in 30 healthy participants. The experiment followed a protocol for increasing the muscle strength by progressive strength training, that was an implementation of a known method in sports science for muscle training, in a new domain of robotic adaptation in muscle training. The study also compared how the participants in three experimental conditions perceived the change in task difficulty levels. One task benefitted from robotic adaptation (Intervention group) where the robot adjusted the task difficulty. The other two tasks were control groups 1 and 2. There was no difficulty adjustment at all in Control 1 group and the difficulty was adjusted manually in Control 2 group. The results indicated that the participants could perform a prolonged progressive strength training exercise with more repetitions with the help of a fatigue-based robotic adaptation, compared to the training interactions, which were based on manual/no adaptation. This study showed that it is possible to alter the level of the challenge using fatigue indicators, and thus, increase the interaction time. The results of the study are expected to be extended to stroke patients in the future by utilising the potential for adapting the training difficulty according to the patient's muscular state, and also to have a large number repetitions in a robot-assisted training environment.

AB  - Seabird foraging behaviour can reflect prey abundance at sea, and is influenced by stress hormone levels, thus providing a potential indicator of at-sea conditions. Using common diving petrels (Pelecanoides urinatrix, hereafter CDPs), a procellariform that preferentially forages on crustacean zooplankton, we sought to understand how spatially separate colonies responded behaviourally and physiologically to contrasting prey levels with a view to recruiting this species as an environmental indicator. In 2016, incubating CDPs from Tiritiri Matangi (- 36.59S; 174.88E, low levels of preferred prey) and Burgess (- 35.91S; 174.12E, high levels of preferred prey) Islands within the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, were tracked using GPS devices. We hypothesised that Tiritiri birds would exhibit greater foraging effort and higher stress hormone levels across the breeding season due to lower levels of available prey. Hidden Markov methods were used to model foraging effort, and prey trophic level (stable isotopes: delta C-13 and delta N-15) and stress hormone levels (CORT) quantified in plasma samples. During incubation birds were spatially segregated when foraging. Tiritiri birds exerted more effort, chasing higher trophic level prey at larger distances from the colony, and had higher body weight and lower CORT than Burgess birds. However, bird CORT levels responded more to reproductive duties (peaking during chick rearing) as opposed to colony location, i.e. CORT was not consistently higher in Tiritiri birds. Although a snapshot, our findings illustrate the promise of integrating multiple parameters when recruiting seabirds as ocean indicators, resulting in improved resolution of future monitoring programmes based upon them.

AB  - Introduction. Overweight and obesity are leading risk factors for metabolic syndrome (MS). From 20 to 35% of Russian people have this condition, depending on their age. MS is a precursor of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Specialized foods (SFs) with hypocholesteremic effects are an important component of the diet therapy for MS patients. Creating local SFs to optimize the nutritional status of MS patients and prevent related diseases is a highly promising area of research. The aim of our study was to develop the formulation and technology of SFs and evaluate their effectiveness in MS treatment.
   Study objects and methods. The objects of the study were food ingredients and SFs. Safety indicators and micronutrient contents were determined by standard methods, whereas nutritional and energy values and amino acid contents were determined by calculation.
   Results and discussion. Based on medical requirements, we selected functional ingredients and developed a formulation and technology of SFs with an optimizexi protein, fat, and carbohydrate composition. The formulation included essential micromitrients and biologically active substances with a desirable physiological effect. Clinical trials involved 15 MS patients aged from 27 to 59. For two weeks, they had a low-calorie standard diet with one serving of SFs in the form of a drink instead of a second breakfast. The patients showed a significant improvement in anthropometric indicators. Blood serum tests revealed decreased contents of total cholesterol (by 16.9%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 15.3%), and triglycerides (by 27.9%).
   Conclusion. We developed technical specifications and produced a pilot batch of SFs. The trials showed an improvement of lipid metabolism in the MS patients who were taking SFs as part of their diet therapy.

AB  - Due to the increasing rise of climate-related disasters in the world, knowledge of risk, monitoring and early warning, dissemination and communication, and disaster preparedness have become demanded. Early Warning Systems (EWS) have been proposed as a strategy for reducing the vulnerability of populations living in at-risk areas. A current challenge in knowledge of risk and disaster preparedness is the inclusion of sociodemographic characteristics of the population in EWS. In order to contribute for an initial comprehension of the dimensions of vulnerability in Brazil, the aim of this paper is to understand the conditions of at-risk populations at an intra-urban scale and the potential application in the Brazilian EWS (BEWS). Through an integration of demographic data and landslide and flood risk mappings of 825 municipalities historically affected by disasters in Brazilian territory, an estimation of 8,266,566 people and 2,470,506 households was achieved. This result indicates that for every 100 inhabitants, 9 lived in disaster risk areas in Brazil. A novel database containing sociodemographic and infrastructure basic services data is available for specific analysis of those who are exposed to disasters. These data, associated with hazard forecast, are essential for effective early warnings, which allow actions focusing the reduction of human losses. The knowledge of at risk population in Brazil may contribute to the identification of the more critical areas that require priority response actions, such as the ones with more presence of elderly, children and a higher concentration of residents in households without sanitation, which are indicators of vulnerability.

AB  - Salvinia natans meets many criteria for accumulative bioindicators and phytoremediation agents. However, the majority of studies on its bioaccumulation capacity were performed under controlled culture conditions. In the present study, Salvinia natans was investigated in a field study. Plant and water samples were collected from aquatic reservoirs located in areas with various dominant land uses (forested, agricultural, residential and industrial). Contents of 10 trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) and phytomass were measured to estimate the bioindication and phytoremediation potential of the species. Results showed that contents of trace elements in S. natans were high compared with other aquatic ferns (Azolla japonica, A. pinata) as well as free-floating vascular plants (e.g. Pistia stratiotes, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, Lemna sp., Eichhornia crassipes). High bioaccumulation factors for Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn confirm accumulative abilities of the plant. Application of neural networks (SOFMs) confirmed that the species may be used in bioindication: the land use type determined the composition of substances carried into water reservoirs with runoff and trace elements accumulated in Salvinia tissues. Ferns in industrial areas had the highest content of Cd, Cu and Zn, while in residential areas plants showed the highest content of As, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni and Pb. Element contents in S. natans in forested areas were the lowest. High standing stocks of Cd, Mn and Ni indicated an important role of S. natans in the cycling of elements and potential use in their removal from aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Serious pollution events caused by residential heating activities occur frequently in northeastern China, and these increased particulate matter levels and gaseous pollutants could contribute to both local emissions and regional climate change. In this study, meteorological data, air trajectories and aerosol vertical distributions were used to study the pollutant sources and movement paths during the heating season (winter-spring transition) in the Harbin-Changchun megalopolis, northeastern China. Higher concentration of fine-mode particles (PM2.5/PM10 similar to 0.70-0.80) and the trace gas SO2 (35-45 mu g m(-3)) could be seem as an indicator of the air quality in the Harbin-Changchun megalopolis during the residential heating seasons, caused by local emissions. The apparent changes of meteorological elements in the high latitude and cold regions over Northeastern China could have important effects on the pollutant formation, secondary transformation, aerosol accumulation and vertical transport over the heating season. The PM2.5 concentrations were highly associated with the SO2 and NO2 from both fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning. The obvious diurnal pollutants variation shown thermodynamic conditions could be considered one of the important environmental elements responsible for residential heating processes. The mixture effect of local emissions and aerosol convective activities were found to contribute to the aerosol extinction and air pollution in the Harbin-Changchun megalopolis. These findings could help to improve our understanding of the association between aerosol pollutants influenced by the anthropogenic activities and the aerosol regional climate effects during the heating season in northeastern China.

AB  - In this study, the ageing behaviour of glass-fibre-reinforced poly(oxymethylene) composite at different conditions was investigated. The ageing was performed in various controlled environments, namely in air at room temperature, in water at room temperature and in an oven at the temperature of 100 celcius. Tensile and flexural tests were conducted to determine the mechanical properties, melt flow index was measured to determine the rheological property and scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphological property of unaged and aged poly(oxymethylene) samples. A reduction in both tensile and flexural strength was observed with all ageing environment. The worst strength retention was obtained with water ageing. Water absorbed by glass-fibre-reinforced poly(oxymethylene) composite had a detrimental influence on the tensile and flexural strength. Tensile strength was affected by the ageing environments. The decrease in the tensile strength of air and thermally aged poly(oxymethylene) was slower than that of water aged poly(oxymethylene), and the tensile strength of aged samples decreased as the ageing time increased. The combined actions of heat, air and water (thermal + water + air ageing) did not further degrade glass-fibre-reinforced poly(oxymethylene) compared to only water ageing at the room temperature. All tensile stress-strain and flexural load-deflection curves showed the similar tendency and did not change with ageing environments and time. All aged samples showed higher melt flow index values than that of unaged sample and the changes in melt flow index could be an indicator of degradation.

AB  - Whether the latitudinal distribution of climate-sensitive lithologies is stable through greenhouse and icehouse regimes remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that the palaeolatitudinal distribution of palaeoclimate indicators, including coals, evaporites, reefs and carbonates, has remained broadly similar since the Permian period, leading to the conclusion that atmospheric and oceanic circulation control their distribution rather than the latitudinal temperature gradient. Here we revisit a global-scale compilation of lithologic indicators of climate, including coals, evaporites and glacial deposits, back to the Devonian period. We test the sensitivity of their latitudinal distributions to the uneven distribution of continental areas through time and to global tectonic models, correct the latitudinal distributions of lithologies for sampling- and continental area-bias, and use statistical methods to fit these distributions with probability density functions and estimate their high-density latitudinal ranges with 50 % and 95 % confidence intervals. The results suggest that the palaeolatitudinal distributions of lithologies have changed through deep geological time, notably a pronounced pole-ward shift in the distribution of coals at the beginning of the Permian. The distribution of evaporites indicates a clearly bimodal distribution over the past similar to 400 Ma, except for Early Devonian, Early Carboniferous, the earliest Permian and Middle and Late Jurassic times. We discuss how the patterns indicated by these lithologies change through time in response to plate motion, orography, evolution and greenhouse/icehouse conditions. This study highlights that combining tectonic reconstructions with a comprehensive lithologic database and novel data analysis approaches provide insights into the nature and causes of shifting climatic zones through deep time.

AB  - Five extreme precipitation indicators were calculated on an annual basis for 1890 through 2013 and analysed to determine spatial patterns and temporal trends in the frequency and magnitude of observed extreme precipitation events in Kansas located in the central United States. Indicators were selected from the list of the World Meteorological Organization-Commission for Climatology (WMO-CCL) and the Research Programme on Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR). The indicators included the number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 10 mm/day (R10), maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD; days with precipitation lower that 1 mm), maximum 5-day precipitation total (R5D), and simple daily intensity index (SDII) which is the annual precipitation total divided by number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 1 mm, and the fraction of annual total precipitation due to events exceeding the 95th percentile (R95T) based on the period 1961-1990. Positive trends in the results were found for a majority of stations for R10, R5D, SDII, and R95T. Consecutive dry days was the only index that had a negative trend at a majority of stations. Spatial pattern analysis indicates greater changes in frequencies and magnitudes for eastern Kansas. Results from this study highlight observed climate shifts in precipitation patterns with a tendency towards greater and more frequent extreme precipitation in eastern Kansas and a tendency towards drier conditions in western Kansas. These hydroclimatic adjustments can produce costly impacts in areas that include flood management, hydraulic structures, water availability throughout the year, agricultural production, ecosystems, and human health.

AB  - BACKGROUND Industrial extraction of orange juice produces a large amount of waste that affects the environment and gives rise to important economic losses; at the same time, information about the composition of the waste is still limited. The present study carried out an exhaustive chemical and physicochemical characterization of the residues in the waste, aiming to increase their potential application for the extraction of functional ingredients. RESULTS Four different products (three solids and one liqueur) were provided by the industry. The overall characterization indicated that carbohydrates comprised the main components. During processing, carbohydrate derivatives were formed such as those corresponding to the initial steps of the Maillard reaction. In this sense, furosine was demonstrated to be a suitable indicator with respect to the control of the process. Although the phenolic content substantially decreased (by up to 57%) as the processing proceeded, the antioxidant capacity was affected to a much lesser extent (similar to 10%). Dehydrated products were rich in galacturonic acid and hardly any change was detected during their elaboration. The liqueur by-product was found to have a much higher level of fructose than glucose and sucrose. CONCLUSION Orange juice waste obtained industrially under the conditions described in the present study could be used as a source of pectic derivatives or fructose in the case of solid or liquid by-products, respectively. The results reported here could diversify the present application of these products as a source of food ingredients, contributing to an improvement in their utilization.

AB  - This paper presents the analysis of caffeine and carbamazepine transport in the subsurface as a result of wastewater release in the Sorek creek over the outcrops of the carbonate, Yarkon-Taninim, aquifer in Israel. Both caffeine and carbamazepine were used as indicators of sewage contamination in the subsurface. While carbamazepine is considered conservative, caffeine is subject to sorption and degradation. The objective of the study was to quantify differences in their transport under similar conditions in the karst aquifer. Water flow and pollutant transport in a "vadose zone-aquifer" system were simulated by a quasi-3-D dual permeability numerical model. The results of this study show that each of these two pollutants can be considered effective tracers for characterization and assessment of aquifer contamination. Carbamazepine was found to be more suitable for assessing the contamination boundaries, while caffeine can be used as a contaminant tracer only briefly after contamination occurs. In instances where there are low concentrations of carbamazepine which appear as background contamination in an aquifer, caffeine might serve as a better marker for detecting new contamination events, given its temporal nature. The estimated caffeine degradation rate and the distribution coefficient of a linear sorption isotherm were 0.091 d(-1) and 0.1 L kg(-1), respectively, which imply a high attenuation capacity. The results of the simulation indicate that by the end of the year most of the carbamazepine mass (approximately 95 %) remained in the matrix of the vadose zone, while all of the caffeine was completely degraded a few months after the sewage was discharged.

AB  - The changes in the structure of the Russian economy are reflected in the results of entrepreneurial activity in regional systems. The current situation is ambiguous at the level of individual territorial entities, especially problematic for peripheral regions, with an insufficient level of development of market infrastructure and a complicated geopolitical situation. In this regard, as a main goal in the work selected refinement and expansion of methodological campaigns to assess the competitiveness of small and medium sized enterprises. The work presents an overview of theoretical scientists on the problem under study, an analysis of existing models of entrepreneurship development is carried out. The differentiation of the country's territories according to development priorities has been carried out, which can help optimize the distribution of regional resources to support business. The rating of territorial structures on the basic social and economic parameters is determined. The methodical approach to an estimation of competitiveness of region in interrelation with an entrepreneurial sector on the basis of a certain system of indicators is specified and expanded. The authors attempted to expand existing ideas on the directions of research on the competitiveness of organizations in the region. As elements of scientific novelty, it is possible to note the justified identification of a group of indicators that include directions for studying the efficiency of using the resources of the territorial system and the level of infrastructure support for the formation of a favorable competitive environment. The theoretical generalizations contained in the work can be used as materials for discussion in a scientific discussion. In addition, they may be of interest to scientific and educational activities.

AB  - With depleted coal resources or deteriorating mining geological conditions, some coal mines have been abandoned in the Fengfeng mining district, China. Water that accumulates in an abandoned underground mine (goaf water) may be a hazard to neighboring mines and impact the groundwater environment. Groundwater samples at three abandoned mines (Yi, Er and Quantou mines) in the Fengfeng mining district and the underlying Ordovician limestone aquifer were collected to characterize their chemical and isotopic compositions and identify the sources of the mine water. The water was HCO3 center dot SO4-Ca center dot Mg type in Er mine and the auxiliary shaft of Yi mine, and HCO3 center dot SO4-Na type in the main shaft of Quantou mine. The isotopic compositions (delta D and delta O-18) of water in the three abandoned mines were close to that of Ordovician limestone groundwater. Faults in the abandoned mines were developmental, possibly facilitating inflows of groundwater from the underlying Ordovician limestone aquifers into the coal mines. Although the Sr2+ concentrations differed considerably, the ratios of Sr2+/Ca2+ and Sr-87/Sr-86 and the S-34 content of SO4 (2-) were similar for all three mine waters and Ordovician limestone groundwater, indicating that a close hydraulic connection may exist. Geochemical and isotopic indicators suggest that (1) the mine waters may originate mainly from the Ordovician limestone groundwater inflows, and (2) the upward hydraulic gradient in the limestone aquifer may prevent its contamination by the overlying abandoned mine water. The results of this study could be useful for water resources management in this area and other similar mining areas.

AB  - This study is the first to provide geochemical and paleoenvironmental information of Jurassic Xishanyao Formation coal in the eastern Junggar Basin, China. Twenty-seven coal core samples were collected from the zk0413 boreholes in Dajing area to determine the geochemical variability. Proximate analyses show that the Xishanyao Formation coal has the medium moisture content (average 13%), special low ash yield (average 6%) and high volatile matter (average 34%), which slightly fluctuate from bottom to top of coal seam. Organic matter in the coal are type III kerogen, with coalification degrees determined as subbituminous A or high volatile bituminous C. All coal samples have poor hydrocarbon generating potential with the yield between 31.93 and 72.36 (average of 43.57) mg HC/g.rock. The primary input of organic matter for coal-formation was higher terrestrial plants, with greater input from algae and micro-organisms and greater role of bacteria in plant degradation higher in the seam. The process of peatification in the lower section of the seam occurred under more acidic and oxic conditions. Coal accumulated in a lacustrine freshwater environment with the rise of the (ground) water table from bottom to top. There is evidence of higher salinity of water within the lower seam and decreased salinity (brackish to fresh water) within the middle of the seam, then an increase to moderate salinity (fresh water to brackish). The increasing stratified water column upward with reduced oxidation in the coal seams may result from the increased temperature in periods of a relatively hot and dry climate. The environment changes demonstrated in this study illustrate the importance of studying combined elemental and organic geochemistry to reconstruct paleoenvironment.

AB  - Many populations of seabirds are in decline across the world and one proposed cause is the global collapse of fish stocks. Recently, it has been shown that breeding success starts to decline at some critical threshold (CT) of maximum prey abundance (MPA). Here, we estimated this empirical threshold for a large seabird, the northern gannet Morus bassanus, and discuss its relevance under various conditions. Using a time series starting at the end of the 1970s that included estimated biomass of fish, gannet population and food consumed by gannets, we found a positive and non-linear relationship between fish biomass and breeding success. This correlation was supported by the results of a bio-energetic model indicating that gannets extract a substantial fraction of the available biomass. In addition, distribution and time spent at sea (derived from GPS recordings) increased considerably when food abundance was low. In contrast to the general CT previously proposed (34%), we found that breeding success of gannets started to decline at about 8% of MPA. Moreover, when corrected for the sizes of prey available that may be eaten by the birds and the removal of fish by the fishing industry, the observed threshold was further reduced, indicating that such effects should be included in the context of ecosystem based management. Theoretical considerations are offered to further explain the discrepancy between the results of our study and a previously published meta-analysis, which included the effect of diet on feeding profitability and the effect of population size.

AB  - Rainfall characteristics such as total amount and rainfall intensity (I) are important inputs in calculating the kinetic energy (KE) of rainfall. Although KE is a crucial indicator of the raindrop potential to disrupt soil aggregates, it is not a routinely measured meteorological parameter. Therefore, KE is derived from easily accessible variables, such as I, in empirical laws. The present study examines whether the equations which had been derived to calculate KE of natural rainfall are suitable for the calculation of KE of simulated rainfall. During the experiment presented in this paper, the measurement of rainfall characteristics was carried out under laboratory conditions using a rainfall simulator. In total, 90 measurements were performed and evaluated to describe the rainfall intensity, drop size distribution and velocity of rain drops using the Thies laser disdrometer. The duration of each measurement of rainfall event was 5 minutes. Drop size and fall velocity were used to calculate KE and to derive a new equation of time-specific kinetic energy (KEtime - I). When comparing the newly derived equation for KE of simulated rainfall with the six most commonly used equations for KEtime - I of natural rainfall, KE of simulated rainfall was discovered to be underestimated. The higher the rainfall intensity, the higher the rate of underestimation. KE of natural rainfall derived from theoretical equations exceeded KE of simulated rainfall by 53-83% for I = 30 mm/h and by 119-275% for I = 60 mm/h. The underestimation of KE of simulated rainfall is probably caused by smaller drops formed by the rainfall simulator at higher intensities (94% of all drops were smaller than 1 mm), which is not typical of natural rainfall.

AB  - The majority of sustainability studies of dairy farms focused on environmental performance and profitability; however, social aspect has been hardly assessed. This study aims to investigate the social impacts of dairy farm via a case study using a social life cycle assessment framework.
   The assessment was carried out applying the social LCA Guideline by UNEP-SETAC. Nineteen suitable social indicators were selected from four stakeholder categories of the guideline. Characterization and normalization were further developed based on data availability. National farm survey data was used as foreground data for farm activities, supplemented with background data from public database and life cycle working environment (LCWE) data by Gabi database. All indicators were divided into three groups: functional unit-related quantitative indicators, non-functional unit-related quantitative indicators and semi-quantitative indicators.
   Irish dairy farming has positive social impacts on value chain actors and society, predominantly positive impacts for local community and generally positive values for workers. The main negative impacts are health and safety issue, equal opportunity for workers, and safe and healthy living conditions for the local community. Possible actions to improve the social performance include introducing more efficient and robotic milk production systems; applying better handling methods and using real time decision support to operational management for emissions reduction.
   This study is the first attempt of social LCA in Ireland. It demonstrated a possible method to carry out SLCA for Irish dairy sector. The results identified the positive and negative social hotspot of dairy farm with recommendation for future improvement.

AB  - Intertidal invertebrates are often used in environmental monitoring programs as they are good indicators of water quality and an important food source for many species of fish and birds. We present data from a monitoring program where the primary aim is to report on the condition of the potential invertebrate prey abundance, biomass and diversity for migrating shorebirds on mudflats adjacent to a waste water treatment plant in a Ramsar listed wetland in Victoria, Australia. A key threat to the foraging habitat at this site has been assessed as a reduction in potential prey items as a result of the changes to the waste water treatment processes. We use control charts, which summarise data from intertidal mudflats across the whole shoreline of the adjacent waste water treatment plant, to elicit a management response when trigger levels are reached. We then examine data from replicate discharge and control sites to determine the most appropriate management response. The monitoring program sits within an adaptive management framework where management decisions are reviewed and the data is examined at different scales to evaluate and modify our models of the likely outcomes of management actions. This study provides a demonstration of the process undertaken in a year when trigger levels were reached and a management decision was required. This highlights the importance of monitoring data from a range of scales in reducing uncertainty and improving decision making in complex systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of daily ranges and maximum ambient temperatures, and other risk factors on reproductive failure of Landrace (L) and Yorkshire (Y) sows under an open-house system in Thailand. Daily ambient temperatures were added to information on 35,579 litters from 5929 L sows and 1057 Y sows from three commercial herds. The average daily temperature ranges (ADT) and the average daily maximum temperatures (PEAK) in three gestation periods from the 35th day of gestation to parturition were classified. The considered reproductive failure traits were the occurrences of mummified fetuses (MM), stillborn piglets (STB), and piglet death losses (PDL) and an indicator trait for number of piglets born alive below the population mean (LBA). A multiple logistic regression model included farrowing herd-year-season (HYS), breed group of sow (BG), parity group (PAR), number of total piglets born (NTB), ADT1, ADT2, ADT3, PEAK1, PEAK2, and PEAK3 as fixed effects, while random effects were animal, repeated observations, and residual. Yorkshire sows had a higher occurrence of LBA than L sows (P = 0.01). The second to fifth parities sows had lower reproductive failures than other parities. The NTB regression coefficients of log-odds were positive (P < 0.01) for all traits. Narrower ranges of ADT3 increased the occurrence of MM, STB, and PDL (P < 0.01), while higher PEAK3 increased the occurrence of MM, STB, PDL, and LBA (P < 0.001). To reduce the risk of reproductive failures, particularly late in gestation, producers would need to closely monitor their temperature management strategies.

AB  - Early-life microbial exposure is of particular importance to growth, immune system development and long-lasting health. Hence, early microbiota composition is a promising predictive biomarker for health and disease but still remains poorly characterized in regards to susceptibility to diarrhoea. In the present study, we aimed to assess if gut bacterial community diversity and composition during the suckling period were associated with differences in susceptibility of pigs to post-weaning diarrhoea. Twenty piglets from 5 sows (4 piglets / litter) were weaned in poor housing conditions to challenge their susceptibility to post-weaning diarrhoea. Two weeks after weaning, 13 pigs exhibited liquid faeces during 2 or 3 days and were defined as diarrhoeic (D) pigs. The other 7 pigs did not have diarrhea during the whole post-weaning experimental periodand were defined as healthy (H) pigs. Using a molecular characterisation of fecal microbiota with CE-SSCP fingerprint, Next Generation Sequencing and qPCR, we show that D and H pigs were mainly discriminated as early as postnatal day (PND) 7, i.e. 4 weeks before post-weaning diarrhoea occurence. At PND 7 H pigs displayed a lower evenness and a higher abundance of Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminocacaceae and Lactobacillaceae compared to D pigs. The sPLS regression method indicates that these bacterial families were strongly correlated to a higher Bacteroidetes abundance observed in PND 30 H pigs one week before diarrhoea. These results emphasize the potential of early microbiota diversity and composition as being an indicator of susceptibility to post-weaning diarrhoea. Furthermore, they support the health promoting strategies of pig herds through gut microbiota engineering.

AB  - Assessment of flow regime alteration is significant for the scientific protection and restoration of rivers. The range of variability approach (RVA) and its revised versions, based on a suite of Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA), have been widely used for flow regime alteration assessment. In these methods, the IHA of each specific year are treated separately, and their individual alterations are used to reflect the alteration of flow regime. However, it is known that one hydrological year is an important hydrological period, and the alteration of inner characteristics of one hydrological year (ICOHY), collectively characterized by the 32 IHA values of the year, can also lead to serious ecological degradation of rivers. In other words, treating the 32 IHA individually and separately in RVA and its revisions can not reflect the alteration of ICOHY. To overcome this limitation, a revised RVA is proposed. In the revised method, the 32 IHA values for each specific year are considered as a set, and the alteration of the set (SA) is measured by the set pair analyses method. The assessment of individual alteration (IA) of each IHA is carried out according to RVA. SA and IA are incorporated into a single index to reflect the overall flow regime alteration (OA). The proposed method is applied to a case study of the Xi Dayang Reservoir in China to test its effectiveness. The results suggest that the RVA underestimates the alteration degree and that the new method could give a more comprehensive assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - SYSTEMS
AB  - With the booming exploration and development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources in source rocks, the estimation of total organic carbon (TOC) content from well logs has become increasingly important because of the significance of TOC in the formation evaluation of those resources. In this paper, a new log overlay method is developed to estimate the TOC content of source rocks with excess radioactivity, but containing little or no potassium feldspar. Specifically, on the basis of previous results of log responses of source rocks, it is believed that the natural gamma ray (GR) log responses of source rocks in the applicable conditions are predominantly contributed by clay minerals and organic matter. A practical clay indicator is established to reflect the clay content using density and neutron logs. The indicator is effective not only in nonsource rocks that contain oil or water but also in source rocks. Furthermore, a new method was developed by overlaying the properly scaled clay indicator curve on the GR curve. In nonsource rocks, including clay-rich rocks and reservoirs saturated with oil or water, the two curves overlie each other, whereas a separation between the curves occurs in organic-rich source rocks. The separation between the curves was defined and expressed and can be used to calculate the TOC consecutively after careful calibration with core data. This method has been successfully applied to two shale gas plays with high-maturity kerogen in the Sichuan Basin, China. In addition, a source rock with low-maturity kerogen was used to verify the new method for its effectiveness, reliability, and widespread adaptability.

AB  - Large-scale, low-density grazing is a standard management concept for conserving or enhancing biodiversity in cultural landscapes of central Europe. Documentation of results concerning effects of this type of grazing on biodiversity and functioning of degraded river valleys, however, is rare. For a period of ten years, we investigated vegetation development of three pastures in a river valley of northern Germany, where rewetting was combined with large-scale cattle grazing for restoration of the valley's biodiversity as well as its water and nutrient regulation. The study yielded ambiguous results concerning achievement of restoration goals. Changes in plant diversity were dependent on site conditions and on previous land-use of the associated pastures. On mineral soils, species richness, total species number and beta-diversity increased. On fen soils that formerly were species-poor wet grasslands, an increase in species richness was observed, whereas at sites formerly of species-rich vegetation, species richness decreased. Development of 13-diversity showed no clear trend on fen sites. Establishment of woody species as indicator for enhanced structural heterogeneity was successful on mineral soils of abandoned arable fields with an open sward, and also on fen soils close to mature nursery trees. We conclude that a fine-tuning of factors influencing grazing behaviour of cattle is necessary for achieving simultaneous targets of nature conservation and resource protection. Restoration of river valleys in cultural landscapes is however a lengthy process, thus, long-term monitoring is indispensable for avoiding mismanagement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aluminum, as an abundant metal, has gained widespread use in human life, entering the body predominantly as an additive to various foods and drinking water. Other major sources of exposure to aluminum include medical, cosmetic, and occupational routes. As a common environmental toxin, with well-known roles in several medical conditions such as dialysis encephalopathy, aluminum is considered a potential candidate in the causality of Alzheimer's disease. Aluminum mostly accumulates in the bone, which makes bone an indicator of the body burden of aluminum and an ideal organ as a proxy for the brain. Most of the techniques developed for measuring aluminum include bone biopsy, which requires invasive measures, causing inconvenience for the patients. There has been a considerable effort in developing non-invasive approaches, which allow for monitoring aluminum levels for medical and occupational purposes in larger populations. In vivo neutron activation analysis, a method based on nuclear activation of isotopes of elements in the body and their subsequent detection, has proven to be an invaluable tool for this purpose. There are definite challenges in developing in vivo non-invasive techniques capable of detecting low levels of aluminum in healthy individuals and aluminum-exposed populations. The following review examines the method of in vivo neutron activation analysis in the context of aluminum measurement in humans focusing on different neutron sources, interference from other activation products, and the improvements made in minimum detectable limits and patient dose over the past few decades.

AB  - The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative aims to describe key dimensional constructs underlying mental function across multiple units of analysis-from genes to observable behaviors-in order to better understand psychopathology. The acute threat ("fear") construct of the RDoC Negative Valence System has been studied extensively from a translational perspective, and is highly pertinent to numerous psychiatric conditions, including anxiety and trauma-related disorders. We examined genetic contributions to the construct of acute threat at two units of analysis within the RDoC framework: (1) neural circuits and (2) physiology. Specifically, we focused on genetic influences on activation patterns of frontolimbic neural circuitry and on startle, skin conductance, and heart rate responses. Research on the heritability of activation in threat-related frontolimbic neural circuitry is lacking, but physiological indicators of acute threat have been found to be moderately heritable (35-50%). Genetic studies of the neural circuitry and physiology of acute threat have almost exclusively relied on the candidate gene method and, as in the broader psychiatric genetics literature, most findings have failed to replicate. The most robust support has been demonstrated for associations between variation in the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes with threat-related neural activation and physiological responses. However, unbiased genome-wide approaches using very large samples are needed for gene discovery, and these can be accomplished with collaborative consortium-based research efforts, such as those of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium.

AB  - This paper studies the effects of the implementation of wastewater treatment (WWT) on the water quality of small urban river systems by considering as an extreme case study (volumetric contribution of wastewaters > 50 %) the evolution of the Zenne River waters (Belgium) over the last 40 years. In urban rivers, organic matter (OM), oxygen, and nutrients are primarily controlled by wastewater releases which depend on the population and the WWT capacity in the river basin, the latter being dependent on environmental policy decisions. We introduce a novel basin-scale evaluation method that considers the evolution of annual pollutant loads at the outlet of the river basin directly as a function of WWT capacity. Based on this approach, we could prove that the load reductions observed after the implementation of WWT in the river basin was a good indicator of the global treatment efficiency of the WWT plants. We also show that high self-purification processes within the river basin may lead to reach minimum levels of OM before the completion of WWT. In addition, the effects of wet weather conditions did also change as a function of the WWT capacity going from positive effects at low capacity to negative effects at high capacity. Finally, the full implementation of WWT in urban river basins does not necessarily guarantee a good status for water quality, mostly because of the high volumetric proportion of treated wastewaters, which do not have the quality standards of river waters.

AB  - Sustainability and green issues are becoming an integral part of business and management. Large gird connected renewable energy (RE) facilities form a subset of sustainability and the clean technology sector. From a business perspective, it is important to understand what policies are available and what factors (drivers) play a key role. This study identifies five main RE policy mechanisms (Feed-In Tariffs (FITs); Tradable Green Certificates; Renewable Portfolio Standards; Bidding/Tendering and Fiscal) of which the FIT has experienced the most success in establishing a RE sector. Using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM), the study relates the policies to the drivers to identify which drivers are most effective within a RE sector. The development and analysis of the model is based on an iterative process, where the draft FCM was adapted to fit a representative model and then further validated by applying country specific examples. Results indicate that all simulations reached an equilibrium state in the FCM model. The four drivers, observed as the most influential drivers, as set out in the propositions are: big players (category: local conditions), non-RE sector (category: economics), cost competitiveness (category: financial) and risk (category: financial). These four drivers seem to play the most influential part of a RE sector when a FIT policy mechanism is deployed. It is proposed that these four drivers are best suited to model a FIT system. This study is one of the first to empirically examine how various drivers emerge and how they need to be managed when designing a RE policy mechanism. Managing the four key drivers - as identified in this study - is pivotal in establishing a sustainable RE sector.

AB  - Background: Phryganic plants are herbs or subshrubs with erect shoots that grow at low altitudes under hot and arid environmental conditions. Many phryganic plants are aromatic/medicinal plants and display the phenomenon of seasonal dimorphism (Thymus sibthorpii, Satureja thymbra, Cistus incanus, Phlomis fruticosa, Teucrium polium, etc.). Phryganic plants of the Mediterranean region are reported so far to be affected by summer drought stress. However, in the present study, the phryganic plant Origanum dictamnus appears to be affected by winter cold stress rather than by summer drought stress in the specific area. This triggered the investigation of the functional and structural traits associated with adaptation of O. dictamnus to cold stress.
   Results: Winter plants of O. dictamnus in order to stand up to the cold, shed all of their large leaves and keep only the small apical leaves, which are covered with a thick insulating layer of dendroid non-glandular hairs. Epidermal and mesophyll cells of apical leaves contain antioxidant vacuolar phenolics protecting from oxidative stress due to low temperatures. Protection from oxidative stress is also provided by the antioxidant essential oils secreted by the numerous glandular hairs. Concentrations of stress indicators like proline and soluble sugars, are always higher in winter leaves compared to summer leaves. Principal components of the O. dictamnus essential oil are p-Cymene, Carvacrol,.-Terpinene, and Borneol. The major constituent of the winter oil is p-Cymene (59.2%) and that of the summer oil Carvacrol (42.4%).
   Conclusion: The presented results provide a structural and functional elucidation for the largely deviating appearance of winter and summer plants of O. dictamnus, and favour the interpretation of adaptation of the plant to cold stress.

AB  - Dendroclimatology can be a useful tool in assessing moisture stress tolerance in tree species that form distinct annual rings, especially in natural selection.
   This study is an attempt to demonstrate the use of dendroclimatology in assessing moisture stress response of teak. Genetic diversity of 48 teak clones was assessed using teak-specific microsatellite markers. Their growth rate was assessed in response to rainfall over 27 years. Dendroclimatological indicators such as mean ring-width index and mean sensitivity index of 48 clones showed close association between rainfall and growth. Lag-1 correlation (r = 0.9) indicated the possibility of carryover effect of rainfall on growth. Direct and positive relationship (R (2) = 0.81) between biomass of annual rings and rainfall across the age, which is contrary to relationship that exists between annual ring width and age, emphasizes the need to use biomass as an additional indicator of growth than annual ring width per se. The relationship seen between delta C-13 discrimination and seasonal difference of rainfall indicates the role of moisture in stomatal conductance and hence carbon assimilation process which is a driving force of growth especially under moisture stress conditions. Growth differences seen among the clones are an indication of diversity among the clones for drought tolerance. The genetic diversity analyzed using 15 microsatellite markers did not match with the moisture stress response seen among the clones which imply the need for developing more specific markers for identifying moisture stress tolerance in teak.

AB  - Large uncertainties in streamflow projections derived from downscaled climate projections of precipitation and temperature can render such simulations of limited value for decision making in the context of water resources management. New approaches are being sought to provide decision makers with robust information in the face of such large uncertainties. We present an alternative approach that starts with the stakeholder's definition of vulnerable ranges for relevant hydrologic indicators. Then the modeled system is analyzed to assess under what conditions these thresholds are exceeded. The space of possible climates and land use combinations for a watershed is explored to isolate subspaces that lead to vulnerability, while considering model parameter uncertainty in the analysis. We implement this concept using classification and regression trees (CART) that separate the input space of climate and land use change into those combinations that lead to vulnerability and those that do not. We test our method in a Pennsylvania watershed for nine ecological and water resources related streamflow indicators for which an increase in temperature between 3 degrees C and 6 degrees C and change in precipitation between -17% and 19% is projected. Our approach provides several new insights, for example, we show that even small decreases in precipitation (approximate to 5%) combined with temperature increases greater than 2.5 degrees C can push the mean annual runoff into a slightly vulnerable regime. Using this impact and stakeholder driven strategy, we explore the decision-relevant space more fully and provide information to the decision maker even if climate change projections are ambiguous.

AB  - Crop water stress monitoring by remote sensing has been the focus of numerous studies. In this paper, specifically red (630-690 nm) and shortwave infrared (SWIR; 1550-1750 nm) wavelength bands are identified to monitor farmland water stress, and a method [modified shortwave infrared perpendicular water stress index (MSPSI)] is developed that is based on the spectral space constructed by SWIR - Red (R-d) and SWIR + Red (R-s). The MSPSI stayed at mostly the same water stress level for full vegetation coverage cases with high vegetation water content and saturated bare soil as well as full vegetation coverage with extremely low vegetation water and dry bare soil in the R-s-R-d spectral feature space. This approach makes the water stress conditions between different covers comparable and the MSPSI applicable to farmland water stress monitoring in different vegetation covers throughout the growing season. To validate the proposed index, the MSPSI calculated from Thematic Mapper images and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m reflectance products (from March to October) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was compared with the ground-measured soil moisture content at different depths. It is evident from the results that the MSPSI derived from satellite imageries is highly correlated with ground-measured soil moisture at different depths (7.6 and 10 cm), with coefficients of determination R-2 of 0.666, 0.512, 0.576, 0.361, 0.383, 0.391, 0.357, 0.410, and 0.418. The paper concludes that MSPSI is a promising index for crop water stress monitoring throughout the growing season.

AB  - We measured biomass and metabolism of epilithic communities on five dates in different seasons at four sites in a watershed that has received extensive restoration for acid mine drainage (AMD) through the construction of passive treatment systems. Chlorophyll a biomass and productivity directly corresponded to AMD stress from coal mining. The site downstream of extensive passive treatment had significantly greater biomass and gross primary productivity rates than the site receiving only untreated AMD, but values were below those for two reference sites, indicating incomplete recovery. The degree of difference in these metrics among sites varied seasonally, primarily related to differences in canopy cover changes, but the ranking of sites in terms of stress generally was consistent. Reference sites had a significantly greater chlorophyll a/pheophytin ratio than untreated and treated sites, also indicating AMD stressed the communities. Community respiration was less affected by AMD stress than productivity or chlorophyll a. Productivity measures are not widely used to assess AMD impacts, and have been shown to both increase and decrease with AMD stress. The elimination of herbivores in AMD-impacted streams can increase productivity in the benthic algal community. Our study found productivity decreased with increasing AMD stress. Although sites with AMD stress had reduced herbivore populations, light, nutrients and metal precipitates appear to have limited growth of AMD-tolerant algal taxa. Therefore, it appears changes in food web structure due to AMD stress had less of an effect on epilithic productivity than environmental conditions within the stream.

AB  - Thrombin is the central enzyme of coagulation. It is engaged in opposing functions in blood. As a procoagulant factor, it converts fibrinogen into an insoluble fibrin clot and activate platelet, as anticoagulant when it activates Protein C. This knowledge is used for the pharmacologic control of blood coagulation, so monitoring its activity is reliable indicator of the rate and extent of coagulation. A simple, rapid, sensitive and accurate spectrophotometric method is suggested for the determination of thrombin in pure form and in biological fluids. The utility of some pi-acceptors as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ), 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetracyanoethylene (TONE) for thrombin (as electron donor) determination is described. These pi-acceptors give highly coloured complex species that have been spectrophotometrically studied. The optimum experimental conditions for these CT reactions have been studied carefully. Beer's law is obeyed over the concentration ranges of 10-130, 50-150 and 10-100 mu g ml(-1) thrombin using DDQ, TCNQ and TONE reagents, respectively. The percentage recovery amounts to 99.33-100.1% (SD = 0.032-0.075), 99.50-102.5% (SD = 0.016-0.076) and 99.5-101.4% (SD = 0.034-0.088) for four to six experiments. The reagents are utilized for the determination of thrombin in poor platelet plasma of dialysis patients with a percentage recovery amount to 98.76-103.3% (for n = 5). No endogenous compounds were found to interfere. The results obtained applying the pi-acceptors reagents are comparable with those obtained by the official method.

AB  - Bohai Bay, the second largest bay of Bohai Sea, largely due to the huge amount of pollutants discharged into it annually and its geohydrologic condition, is considered to be one of the most polluted marine areas in China. To slow down, halt and finally reverse the environmental deterioration of Bohai Sea, some researchers have proposed to connect it with Jiaozhou Bay in the western coast of Southern Yellow Sea by digging an interbasin canal through Shandong Peninsula. In order to assess the heavy metal pollution and provide background information for such a large geoengineering scheme, surface sediments from 42 stations covering both riverine and marine regions of the northwestern coast of Bohai Bay were analyzed for heavy metal content and fractionation (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn). Three empirically derived sediment quality guidelines were used to assess the pollution extent of these metals. The studied metals had low mobility except for Cd at all stations and Zn at some riverine stations. Although a high mobility of Cd was observed, it could hardly cause a bad effect on the environment owing to its low total concentrations. Anthropogenic influence on the accumulation of studied heavy metals in sediments of Bohai Bay was obvious, but their contents were relatively lower to date comparing with some other marine coastal areas that receive important anthropogenic inputs. Taking as a whole, surface sediments of northwestern Bohai Bay had a 21% probability of toxicity based on the mean effects range-median quotient. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The upper Lerma River is the most economically important basin of Mexico because it is the region where 80 % of the commercial activity of the country takes place, with 3500 industries, 750,000 Ha of irrigated land and 14 cities with populations over 100,000 inhabitants. Despite this relevance, little or no waste water treatment is done in the basin, which results in high contamination levels. The present paper deals with the taxonomy and ecology of epilithic diatoms collected at 11 sites in the basin in the dry and post-rainy seasons of the 2003-2005 period. This is the first study in an environmental direction of the diatoms of the upper Lerma River basin and the information generated will be used to propose, in the short-term, a Lerma River diatom index (IDL), supporting water quality monitoring programs. 178 taxa were recognized, of which 112 taxa (63%) were cosmopolitan or widely distributed. The genera with most species were Nitzschia (34), Navicula (19), Gomphonema (15), and Pinnularia (11). The dominant species in the studied locations and study period were Eolimna subminuscula (Manguin) Moser, Lange-Bertalot et Metzeltin, Gomphonema parvulum (K tzing) K tzing, Navicula veneta K tzing, Nitzschia capitellata Hustedt, N. sublinearis Hustedt, N. umbonata (Ehrenberg) Lange-Bertalot and Sellaphora pupula (K tzing) Mereschkowsky, which are characterized as tolerant to a-me-so-sa-probic to polysaprobic conditions, and to high nitrogen content. Trends in distribution of diatom species in the sampling sites were explained by variations in environmental parameters such as depth, conductivity, pH, temperature, and total dissolved solids.

AB  - Actualistic studies of shell taphonomy in the marine subfossil record have found alteration in shell color to be a highly useful taphonomic indicator; however, the viability of shell discoloration for this purpose in the more profoundly altered material of the deep-time fossil record has not been explored. We investigated the relationship between the shell discoloration of Ordovician brachiopods and their taphonomic state to determine what information discoloration could provide about the conditions under which the shells were preserved. We examined 1033 specimens of Vinlandostrophia and Hebertella from type-Cincinnatian outcrops in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky, using a sampling design that allowed us to test the taphonomic significance of shell color in multiple stratigraphic units and across a wide geographic area. For each specimen, taphonomic data were recorded and multivariate analyses of the taphonomic attributes performed. Our results demonstrate that fossil shell discoloration is strongly related to overall taphonomic state, with darker colors associated with evidence of shell degradation. Further analyses suggest that shell color may be related to the incorporation of sulfide minerals and organic matter. Darker colors may reflect a higher residence time in the taphonomically active zone, in environments with slow sedimentation rates or multiple burial and exhumation cycles. Alternatively, darker colors may be indicative of environments with higher probabilities of discoloration, related to sediment and pore-water geochemistry. The slicing correlation between shell discoloration and other indicators of taphonomic damage is evidence that discoloration reflects a taphonomic pathway from pristine to degraded shells, and may be a useful addition to taphofacies models.

AB  - Safe and effective contraceptive agents are needed to manage overabundant populations of cervids in settings where traditional management methods such as hunting are prohibited or impractical. We used GonaCon (TM) Immunocontraceptive Vaccine to reduce reproduction in individual white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on a fully fenced corporate-office campus in suburban New Jersey, USA. In JulyAugust 2005, we captured, marked, injected, and released 47 adult females and then monitored their reproductive performance for 2 years. Thirty-two of these females each received a 1.0-mL injection of GonaCon vaccine, and 15 control females were given sham injections. Field observations of udder condition during summers of 2006 and 2007 were used to determine which adult female deer were lactating; lactation was used as an indicator of imminent or recent parturition. During summer 2006, 8 of 24 GonaCon-treated deer were pregnant, in contrast to 12 of 13 control deer. During summer 2007, 2 years after injections were given, 13 of 23 GonaCon-treated and 10 of 12 control animals were pregnant. We also captured, vaccinated, and released fawns (both sexes) and yearling and adult males and then monitored their reproductive status. Immunocontraception of fawns was unsuccessful. In some GonaCon-treated males (all age classes), serum testosterone concentrations and development of testes and antlers were reduced. Higher anti-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone antibody titers were associated with greater infertility in females and with lower values for reproductive parameters in males. GonaCon reduced reproduction in wild adult female white-tailed deer, but greater contraceptive efficacymay be required for it to gain widespread acceptance and use by natural resource managers.

AB  - Forest biomass is increasingly being considered as a source of sustainable energy. It is crucial, however, that this biomass be grown and harvested in a sustainable manner. International processes and certification systems have been developed to ensure sustainable forest management (SFM) in general, but it is important to consider if they adequately address specific impacts of intensified production and harvesting methods related to forest fuels. To explore how existing SFM frameworks address sustainable forest fuel production, criteria and indicators (C&I) from 10 different international processes and organizations and 157 international, national and sub-national forest management certification standards under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) were reviewed. International processes include indicators that require identification or reporting of availability, harvested amounts, value, or share in energy consumption of forest fuels. Forest certification standards address several specific woodfuel issues, but not always in a consistent manner. It seems that developed countries more frequently address environmental consequences of harvesting residues or whole trees on soil fertility and biodiversity, while developing countries more frequently address social issues, such as local people's access to firewood and working conditions in charcoal production. Based on findings, options to improve SFM standards for sustainable forest fuel production are discussed. These options include clarification of terminology, systematic inclusion of important management impacts unique to forest fuel production, coordination of efforts with other related governance processes, including tools promoting sustainability at more integrated levels, such as landscape, supply chain and global levels.

AB  - Biomarkers are indicators of biological conditions that can be detected and measured in body fluids or tissues. Biomarkers can be detectable before the clinical onset of the disease, and are thus useful for prognosis; they can be measured at early stages of the disease and are useful for stratification and classification of the disease and patients; they can be monitored along the disease course and used as indicators of risk factors and pharmacological response to treatment. Ideally, biomarkers should be sensitive, specific, have high predictive power, and be easily accessible. Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) is the most frequent chronic inflammatory disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide and leading to joint damage and substantial morbidity. RA is a heterogeneous disorder with a fluctuating clinical course and unpredictable prognosis. And although a large panel of biologics is available to clinicians, the main challenge remains to treat patients as early as possible with the most personalised therapy. Today, the most challenging issue in RA is the identification of biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and for prediction of drug response. Among molecules that can fulfil this expectation, micro(mi)-RNAs certainly represent an option. The potential value of miRNAs as a novel class of biomarkers is well documented in cancer. Moreover, the presence and stability of miRNAs in body fluids provide fingerprints that can serve as molecular biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutic outcome. As a growing body of evidences reveals abnormal expression of specific miRNAs in RA tissues, the use of a blood-based miRNA signature for optimal diagnosis and treatment becomes a realistic option.

AB  - Seismic monitoring of sequestered carbon dioxide (CO2) in underground deposits is a matter of growing importance. The subsurface monitoring of this greenhouse gas is possible due to the marked contrast between the physical properties of natural reservoir fluids and those of carbon dioxide after the injection. This technique makes necessary the investigation of appropriate seismic indicators to link seismic attributes to petrophysical properties, composition and state of the rock as well as pore-fluid type and in-situ physical conditions. With this motivation in mind, we use a Biot-Gassmann formulation to model the theoretical P-wave amplitude reflection coefficients vs. angle of incidence in the seismic range when a planar P-wave strikes the interface between a caprock and a porous sandstone which has its pore space saturated by a mixture of CO2 with brine or oil at different states (supercritical, liquid and gas). The effects of dissolution of CO2 in oil and the existence of a saturation threshold, above which a free CO2 phase develops, are included in the computations. Attention is particularly focused on the sensitivity of the classic best-fit amplitude variations with angle coefficients, to different degrees of CO2 saturation. We conclude from this analysis that the changes in seismic AVA attributes between 30 and 40 degrees can be useful to infer bounds on the CO2 saturation degree, to detect the presence of immiscible CO2 phase and, in some cases, to infer the physical state of the accumulations.

AB  - Yearling Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were sampled concurrently with physical variables (temperature, salinity, depth) and biological variables (chlorophyll a concentration and copepod abundance) along the Washington and Oregon coast in June 1998-2008. Copepod species were divided into four different groups based on their water-type affinities: cold neritic, subarctic oceanic, warm neritic, and warm oceanic. Generalized linear mixed models were used to quantify the relationship between the abundance of these four different copepod groups and the abundance of juvenile salmon. The relationships between juvenile salmon and different copepod groups were further validated using regression analysis of annual mean juvenile salmon abundance versus the mean abundance of the copepod groups. Yearling Chinook salmon abundance was negatively correlated with warm oceanic copepods, warm neritic copepods, and bottom depth, and positively correlated with cold neritic copepods, subarctic copepods, and chlorophyll a concentration. The selected habitat variables explained 67% of the variation in yearling Chinook abundance. Yearling coho salmon abundance was negatively correlated with warm oceanic copepods, warm neritic copepods, and bottom depth, and positively correlated with temperature. The selected habitat variables explained 40% of the variation in yearling coho abundance. Results suggest that copepod communities can be used to characterize spatio-temporal patterns of abundance of juvenile salmon, i.e., large-scale interannual variations in ocean conditions (warm versus cold years) and inshore-offshore (cross-shelf) gradients in the abundance of juvenile salmon can be characterized by differences in the abundance of copepod species with various water mass affinities.

AB  - Enchytraeus albidus are important organisms of the soil biocenosis, used as standard test species in environmental risk assessment. The inhibition of cholinesterases (ChE) activity of several species has been widely used to assess the exposure and effects of anti-cholinesterase environmental contaminants. Several studies have shown the association between ChE activity inhibition and adverse effects on behaviour and survival. Extensive studies addressing survival and behavioural endpoints, as well as other biomarkers, have been done in E. albidus with different types of soil contaminants. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to characterize biochemically the ChE present in the soluble post-mitochondrial fraction of E. albidus whole body homogenates, using different substrates and selective inhibitors; (2) to assess the in vivo effects of copper, phenmedipham and different soil properties (pH, organic matter, clay) on the ChE activity; (3) to assess the in vitro effects of copper and phenmedipham on the ChE activity. The results suggest the presence of one ChE in the soluble post-mitochondrial fraction of E. albidus whole body homogenates, which displays properties of both acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase considering the typical mammalian enzymes. It is also shown that ChE activity is not inhibited by exposure to different soil properties and that copper and phenmedipham inhibited ChE activity both in in vivo and in in vitro conditions and therefore ChE inhibition seems to be a robust biomarker for this herbicide and this heavy metal. This study showed that ChE activity in E. albidus might be correlated to previously determined higher level effects like survival and reproduction, as well as avoidance behaviour.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether video-based coping skills (VCS) training with telephone coaching reduces psychosocial and biological markers of distress in primary caregivers of a relative with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD). Methods: A controlled clinical trial was conducted with 116 ADRD caregivers who were assigned, alternately as they qualified for the study, to a Wait List control condition or the VCS training arm in which they viewed two modules/week of a version of the Williams Life Skills Video adapted for ADRD family care contexts, did the exercises and homework for each module presented in an accompanying Workbook, and received one telephone coaching call per week for 5 weeks on each week's two modules. Questionnaire-assessed depressive symptoms, state and trait anger and anxiety, perceived stress, hostility, caregiver self-efficacy, salivary cortisol across the day and before and after a stress protocol, and blood pressure and heart rate during a stress protocol were assessed before VCS training, 7 weeks after training was completed, and at 3 months' and 6 months' follow-up. Results: Compared with controls, participants who received VCS training plus telephone coaching showed significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, perceived stress, and average systolic and diastolic blood pressures that were maintained over the 6-month follow-up period. Conclusions: VCS training augmented by telephone coaching reduced psychosocial and biological indicators of distress in ADRD caregivers. Future studies should determine the long-term benefits to mental and physical health from this intervention.

AB  - There is no reliable indicator for identifying Zn-deficiency tolerant genotypes with high grain yield. The aim of this investigation was to compare the grain yield response of 30 spring and 20 winter bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes to Zn fertilization under field condition and to select high grain yield Zn-deficiency tolerant genotypes using a stress tolerance indicator. The stress tolerance indicator is a stress tolerance index (STI) used to identify genotypes that produce high yields under both nonstress and stress environments. Two individual trials, each consisting of two field plot experiments, were conducted during the 2006-2007 growing season. Spring wheat genotypes (Trial 1) and winter wheat genotypes (Trial 2) were planted in two different locations. Two Zn rates, 0 and 40 kg Zn ha(-1), using ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O were evaluated. Grain yield varied significantly (P < 0.01) among wheat genotypes regardless of Zn treatment. Application of Zn fertilizer increased grain yield of spring wheat genotypes an average of 883 and 913 kg ha(-1) in Karaj and Isfahan locations, respectively, although considerable variation was found among genotypes in response to Zn fertilization. Zinc efficiency (ZE) significantly differed among wheat genotypes and ranged from 69% to 95% for spring wheat and from 62% to 105% for winter wheat genotypes. Most of the wheat genotypes were placed in group A (genotypes that arc not affected by stress) and D (genotypes with low yield in both stress and nonstress environments) based on the STI. The results showed that the STI could be a better selection criterion compared with ZE for identifying high-yield stress-tolerant genotypes.

AB  - Salvia spp. belongs to the Labiatae family and is characterized by antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to test its in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effect against bacteria as well as to find an alternative possibility to use sage in the rabbit ecosystem examining biochemical, zootechnical and inmunological indicators, compared to the commercial feed mixture Xtract. Using the sage extract in in vitro tests, its inhibitory effect was noted. Under in vivo conditions, in the experimental group with sage (EG1), reduction of Pseudomonas-like sp. (p < 0.01) and E. coli (p < 0.01) was noted after 7 days of sage application compared to the control group CG2 (with Robenidin) as well as after 21 days of sage extract application, when the reduction of coagulase negative staphylococci (p < 0.01) was detected (in comparison with the experimental group-EG2, Xtract group). In the caecum of rabbits from EG1, higher values of lactic, acetic and butyric acids were noted. The values of propionic acid were not influenced. Biochemical indicator,. were not influenced; however, the values of GSH Px were lower in EG1 compared to EG2. Higher phagocytic activity (18%) was noted in EG1 than in EG2 (13%) after 21 days of additives application. The reduction of Eimeria sp. oocysts was demonstrated in EG1 (sage group) after 7 days of sage application comparing to CG2 (217 OPG to 566 OPG). The animals in both experimental groups achieved higher reed consumption and weight gain, lower mortality compared to both controls. Neither of the additives had a negative influence on the health status and growth performance of rabbits,

AB  - To investigate postglacial environmental changes in both the coastal and interior wet belts of British Columbia, fossil midges were analysed from two subalpine lakes, one adjacent to the lower Fraser canyon (Frozen Lake), and the other in Mount Revelstoke National Park (Eagle Lake). The midge stratigraphy for Frozen Lake revealed an abundance of rheophilous chironomid taxa and Simuliidae larvae, reflecting the presence of an inflowing stream. An abundance of Chaoborus mandibles and Microtendipes during the early Holocene (c. 10 100-7700 C-14 years BP, c. 11500-8500 cal. years BP) suggests warmer temperatures. A subsequent decline in the warm indicators and relative increases in cold stenotherms (Heterotrissocladius and Diamesa) indicate cooling until present day. This climate reconstruction is consistent with other quantitative and qualitative evidence for past climatic change in southern British Columbia. At Eagle Lake the warm indicators, Dicrot-endipes and Polypedilum, are seen in the early Holocene (c. 8500-6730 C-14 years BP, c. 9600-7600 cal. years BP), but are absent during the mid-Holocene when cooler temperatures probably prevailed. In the late Holocene (c. 3800 C-14 years BP to present, c. 4200 cal. years BP to present) there is a resurgence of warm indicators, which contrasts with the evidence of continued cooling typically seen in reconstructions of southern British Columbia summer temperatures. The Eagle Lake record therefore appears to be anomalous. Multiproxy and multisite investigations are needed to reconstruct Holocene climatic changes more reliably.

AB  - The influence of daily orally administered crude extract of bacteriocin-like substance (at a concentration of 3200 AU/ml) produced by Enterococcus faecium EF55 on the total counts of lactobacilli, staphylococci, enterococci and E. coli in the faeces and caecum of 3-day-old Japanese quails was investigated. Enterococcus faecium EF55 was isolated from the crop content of a chicken (Gallus domesticus). The inhibitory activity of bacteriocin-like substance (BLIS) produced by the strain EF55 was assayed by the agar spot test using Gram-positive and Gram-negative indicator bacteria. A wide range of Gram-positive genera such as Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Aerococcus was susceptible to BLIS, but none of the Gram-negative bacteria. The antimicrobial substance produced by the strain EF55 was thermo-resistant (30 min at 100 degreesC), stable at pH 4.0 to 9.0 at -20 degreesC, 4 degreesC and 22 degreesC for 10 d tested, and inactivated by proteolytic enzymes indicating its proteinaceous nature. After the first administration of bacteriocin crude extract (BCE) of EF55 strain to Japanese quails, a reduction amounting to 0.83-1.3 log cycles of E. coli, enterococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli in faeces was observed within 24 h. This inhibitory effect was most visible after first extract addition, later this difference was diminished. By agar spot test, BLIS produced by the strain EF55 of Ent.faecium was active against Staphylococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp., isolates obtained from the experimental birds. However, no inhibition against E. coli was detected, despite of their decreased counts under in vivo conditions.

AB  - A research was conducted, for two years. to evaluate the production of seeds in 90 accessions of Leucaena leucocephala from the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) in Colombia. The multivariate analysis was used. The method of principal components showed that more than 90 % of the variability, accumulated in three factors,,vas from the morphological indicators of yield. length and number of seeds/pods, weight of 1000 seeds and total weight of seed production/plant, in the analysis of the first and second year and in both. The method of conglomerates (Clusters) made possible the obtainment of groups that were reordered according to their biological performance and, at the same tulle, the accessions were grouped according to their similarities. There were groups of good performance in which the total yield of seed per plant was Lip to 300 g. while., in other groups, it was never Superior to 20 g. The number of seeds/pods was LIP to 24. The weight of 1000 seeds was. sometimes. 50.5 g, while the length of the pod varied from 10 to 22.8 cm. The cultivar Peru, widely used in Cuba. was among the best groups of accessions. The results showed that more than 70 % of the accessions had good conditions to produce seeds in the western part Of the country. The best accessions and the necessity of their proper management are discussed. It is concluded that the multivariate analysis, strategically used. is all effective method to evaluate the production of seeds in large groups of accessions or plant species phylogenetically related. combining the mathematical results with the biological performance.

AB  - Phytolith analysis of grasses is a useful tool in palaeoenvironmental and archaeobotanical research. Lobate phytolith is one of the most important morphotypes of grass phytoliths. This study describes morphological variations of diagnostic lobate phytoliths and produces a tentative classification scheme based on 250 modern grass species from China and the south-eastern U.S.A. Eighty-five grass species were found to contain lobate phytoliths. They are derived mainly from Panicoideae, but also include the Chloridoideae, Oryzoideae and Arundinoideae subfamilies. Twenty-five lobate morphological types were observed from different subfamilies, genera or tribes of grasses, based on two important parameters: (1) the length of the lobate shank and (2) the shape of the outer margin of the two lobes. The identification of grass tribe or even genus is possible based on the differences in lobate shape parameters or the composition of assemblages. However, not all of the lobate assemblages have a definite relationship with the genera that produce them, because grasses can only produce a limited range of lobate shapes that often overlap from one genus to another. Several C-3 grasses and Chloridoideae subfamily grasses also produce characteristic lobate phytoliths. The variations of lobate morphologies can be related to environmental factors, especially moisture. Typical hygrophytic grasses tend to yield lobate phytoliths with very short shank, whereas typical xerophytic grasses tend to produce lobate phytoliths with a very long shank. The potential link between phytolith morphology, grass taxonomy and environmental conditions opens the possibility that phytolith morphology may be used as a proxy in palaeoclimatic reconstruction.

KW  - METHODOLOGY
AB  - Risk assessment is considered to be an effective scientific tool which enables decisionmakers to manage hazardous waste-contaminated sites in a cost-effective manner while preserving public health. However, the current risk assessment framework proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has limitations in addressing the true variability of population characteristics. This study proposed a methodology that is different from the existing framework by accounting for the true variability of population characteristics. The key differences of the proposed methodology and the existing framework are the (1) use of the transient exposure concentration; (2) use of the entire population rather than a representative ideal individual;. (3) use of age- and gender-based population subgroups to represent population characteristics; (4) use of a population growth model to represent growth dynamics; and (5) presentation of risk through a risk profile with risk summarized through a single indicator, potential cancer incidences (PCI). The proposed methodology was applied in a ground water contamination scenario due to benzene to determine its applicability. The results of the study showed that age-based variability of population characteristics is important in predicting the population risk while gender played a small role. The existing US EPA methodology and its variation using age-independent variability of population characteristics overestimate the risk given by PCI substantially, and therefore, the decisions can lead to costly cleanup goals. Population risk is not a single value but a distribution due to the contribution from different individuals of the exposed population. Hence, the decision criterion proposed in this study, PCI, is found to be a useful indicator to describe population carcinogenic risk to the society under a variety of conditions and scenarios.

AB  - Cartographic modeling was used to examine the influence of deforestation on landscape pattern metrics. Progressive deforestation resulted in an increase in the spatial heterogeneity, fragmentation, and edge characteristics of a landscape while connectivity attributes varied with deforestation stage. Pattern changes in heterogeneity and edge characteristics were curvilinear, with metrics changing direction at the half-way point of deforestation. The progressive loss of forest enhanced edge length, interspersion, and convexity. There was an exponential decline in interior forest and mean patch size, while patch density and interpatch distance increased. The variability displayed by several pattern metrics reflect the unpredictability in patch disappearance.
   The relative contribution of each metric for discriminating between contiguous and fragmented landscape conditions was ranked using discriminant analysis. The results suggested that the mastery of landscape analysis can be directly Linked to the choice of the pattern metric. Percent forest interior, contiguity, and convexity were highly significant (P<0.001). Forest loss was also significantly reflected by mean patch size, number of patches, mean patch density, and interpatch distance. Metrics that contributed Little to discrimination displayed unpredictable behavior or exhibited high variability about their mean values.
   This paper develops an approach for monitoring the influence of deforestation on the landscape, and examines how pattern-related habitat components are affected by deforestation. The ability to quantify pattern change resulting from deforestation has direct implications to resource management and wildlife habitat assessment. Descriptions of pattern change accompanying deforestation provide a critical component of habitat analyses. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - . The lowland calcareous grasslands of northwestern Europe are highly prized by ecologists and conservationists as a result of the diversity of their plant and invertebrate communities. Large areas of such grasslands have been lost this century as a result of changes in agricultural land use. Recent changes in agricultural policies, in particular the introduction of agri-environmental incentive schemes, have resulted in an increasing area being managed for the restoration of these communities. This paper reviews the management techniques employed in the restoration of lowland calcareous grasslands and the factors that govern their success. Constraints on the enhancement of the plant diversity of restoration sites include high soil fertility and the presence of undesirable species in the soil seed bank. However, it is thought that the primary constraint is the availability of propagules from which new populations can be established. Similarly, the dispersal mode and ability of insect species is likely to be the major factor limiting the enhancement of insect diversity. Evaluation of the success of restoration management usually involves monitoring changes in the plant community. However, as a result of their short life-cycles and sensitivity to small-scale environmental conditions, insects may respond more rapidly to changes resulting from restoration management and therefore provide better indicators of success. With the exception of a few high-profile butterfly species, the use of insects as indicator taxa has largely been neglected in terrestrial systems. This paper illustrates their potential use with reference to lowland calcareous grasslands in southern Britain.

AB  - Drought is the second major constraint to common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) production after disease. This study examined yield under drought, yield potential, drought susceptibility index, harvest index, and geometric mean as potential indicators of drought resistant genotypes. The performance of two common bean populations, consisting of 78 and 95 recombinant inbred lines, was examined under moisture stress and nonstress regimes. Experiments were conducted at seven locations (1990-1994) in Michigan and Mexico to identify effective selection criteria for drought resistance. Two genotypes from each population yielded in the top 10% under both stress and nonstress conditions. Heritability estimates for yield in the Sierra/AC1028 population, based on 5 yr of data, ranged from 0.55 to 0.59 for stress and nonstress, respectively, and from 0.20 to 0.19 for stress and nonstress, respectively, in the Sierra/Lef-2RB population. Heritability for plant biomass was 0.52 for stress and 0.55 for nonstress in the Sierra/AC1028 population and 0.15 under stress and 0.05 under nonstress in the Sierra/Lef-2RB population. One-hundred seed weight was the most highly heritable trait in both populations with heritability estimates of 0.80 for the Sierra/AC1028 population and 0.65 for the Sierra/Lef-2RB population. The geometric mean of the two moisture regimes was the single strongest indicator of performance under stress and nonstress, and a breeding strategy that involves selection based first on the geometric mean, followed by selection based on yield under stress, was suggested as the most effective strategy to improve drought resistance in common bean.

T2  - COMBUSTION AND FLAME
LA  - English
AB  - A commercially available nonpremixed pulsed combustion room heater designed to burn natural gas has been used to study emissions of NOx and CO using a wide range of fuel flowrates and fuel compositions. In particular, the effect of addition of hydrogen and propane to the fuel has been investigated. When burning methane alone, NOx emissions increased as the fuel flowrate increased, and there was also a marked switch from emitting predominantly NO2 at high excess air (low temperature) to predominantly NO at low excess air (high temperature). NOx emissions appear to be determined by the residence time at high temperature in the near-stoichiometric burning zone; the proportion of NOx emitted as NO2 is determined by the temperature after mixing with excess air and the backflow of exhaust gases. Adding small amounts of hydrogen to the fuel increased NOx emissions by lowering the excess air, but if the proportion of hydrogen in the fuel rose to over 20%, too high a phase angle between the heat release and pressure oscillations led to a deterioration in combustor performance, a sudden increase in the emission of CO, and a decrease in the emission of NOx owing to a reduction in temperature. Addition of propane increased NOx emissions by lowering the excess air in the combustion chamber and hence increasing the chamber temperature. Results from running the combustor with a wide variety of fuel compositions and operating conditions suggest that, despite its being a nonpremixed combustor, calculated adiabatic flame temperature can be used as an indicator of the quantity and nature of NOx emissions, provided that combustion remains essentially complete.

AB  - Site 532 on the Walvis Ridge was sampled at 4000- to 800-year intervals from 2.24 to 2.60 Ma, spanning the three large glacial advances of the late Pliocene. An age model was created by correlating the oxygen isotope record to Site 607 with linear interpolations between tie-lines. The resultant age model differs from that in the site reports by more than 800,000 years, due to misidentification of a magnetic boundary. Sedimentation rates varied by an order of magnitude at this site, with minimum accumulation during glacial events. Interglacial intervals were charactrized by high marine production and high summer precipitation on land, while glacials had ver-y low production and arid continental climate. During the large glacial events (Stages 96-100) conditions of low production and continental aridity reached their greatest intensity, but there is no evidence of a permanent mode shift in either marine or terrestrial records. Calcite concentration has a strong variation at obliquity frequencies, with maxima during interglacials, but occasionally shows a large amplitude at precessional frequencies as well, so that high concentrations occur in a few glacial intervals. As a result, color variation is not a reliable guide to glacial-scale cycles at this site. Composition of the phytoplankton assemblage is diverse and highly variable, and we have not been able to distinguish a clear indicator of upwelling-related production. Spectral analysis reveals obliquity and precessional signals in the pollen data, while several diatom records contain combination tones, indicating that these data represent a complicated response to both local and high-latitude forcing.

AB  - The interacting effects of multiple hazards pose a substantial challenge to poverty reduction and national development. Yet, social vulnerability to multiple hazards is a relatively understudied, though growing concern. The impacts of climate hazards in particular, leave increasingly large populations becoming more exposed and susceptible to the devastating effects of repeat, chronic and sequential natural hazards. Multi-hazard research has focused on the physical aspects of natural hazards, giving less attention to the social facets of human-hazard interaction. Further, there is no single conceptualization of 'multi-hazard'. This systematic review utilizes correlations and hierarchical clustering to determine how social vulnerability is assessed in the context of the three most common classifications of 'multi-hazard': aggregate, cascading and compound. Results reveal these classifications of 'multi-hazard' each focus on different aspects of social vulnerability. Studies in the aggregate classification of multi-hazard were more likely to represent social vulnerability as an outcome of hazard events, while those in the cascading and compound classifications more often addressed social vulnerability as a preexisting condition. Further, knowledge of social vulnerability to multi-hazards comes mainly from the aggregate classification and the mitigation phase of the disaster cycle. The difference in perspectives of social vulnerability covered, and limited context in which multi-hazard studies of social vulnerability have been applied, mean a full understanding of social vulnerability remains elusive. We argue that research should focus on the cascading and compound classifications of multi-hazards, which are more suited to interrogating how human-(multi)hazard interactions shape social vulnerability.

AB  - We carried out a 4-year manipulative field experiment in a semiarid shrubland in southeastern Spain to assess the impacts of experimental warming (W), rainfall reduction (RR), and their combination (W + RR) on the composition and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities in rhizosphere soil of H. syriacum and G. struthium shrubs using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing. Across climate treatments, we encountered 109 AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were assigned to four families: Glomeraceae (93.94%), Gigasporaceae (2.19%), Claroideoglomeraceae (1.95%), and Diversisporaceae (1.92%). AMF community composition and diversity at OTU level were unaffected by the climate manipulation treatments, except for a significant decrease in AMF OTU richness in the W treatment relative to the control. However, we found a significant decrease of AMF family richness in all climate manipulation treatments relative to the control treatment. Members of the Gigasporaceae and Diversisporaceae families appeared to be highly vulnerable to intensification of heat and drought stress, as their abundances decreased by 67% and 77%, respectively, in the W + RR treatment relative to current ambient conditions. In contrast, the relative abundance and dominance of the Glomeraceae family within the AMF community increased significantly under the W + RR treatment, with Glomeraceae being the indicator family for the W + RR treatment. The interaction between warming and rainfall reduction had a significant effect on AMF community structure at family level. These findings provide new insights to help in the conservation of the soil biodiversity facing climate change in dryland ecosystems.

AB  - The present study evaluated the general welfare state of two strains of transgenic goats bred in a region with a hot and humid tropical climate. Nine females were used, being three transgenic for human lysozyme (hLZ group), three transgenic for human glucocerebrosidase (hGCase group), and three non-transgenic (control group). The temperature and humidity index (THI) were recorded during the morning, afternoon, and evening. The physiological parameters measured were respiratory rate, heart rate, and rectal and vaginal temperatures. Venous blood samples were collected using Vacutainer (R) tubes containing 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Also, analysis of erythrogram, leukogram, and some biochemical parameters of serum was performed. It was observed that the afternoon shift presented the largest THI, being potentially more impactful on the physiology of animals. In general, respiratory and heart rates were higher in transgenic animals, especially in the hLZ group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Regarding the hematological parameters, the quantification of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the hGCase group compared to that in the hLZ and control. The leukocyte count was considerably lower (P < 0.05) in the hLZ group compared to that in the hGCase and control. Correlation analysis showed that the increase in THI was associated with a change in physiological parameters normally used as indicators of thermal stress. Despite the differences found among the experimental groups, all the physiological parameters remained within the normal limits recommended for the goat species. Further studies involving a larger number of animals from different categories should be carried out to elucidate the impacts that transgenesis can have on animal welfare under different THI conditions.

AB  - Hyporheic groundwater geochemistry evolution depends on the interactions of surface water and groundwater (SW-GW). Hydrodynamic variations driven by the long-term managed aquifer recharge (MAR) practice could change hyporheic geochemical processes, which requires a better understanding for groundwater management. In this work, a geochemical survey was conducted in a multi-aquifer MAR system. The results showed great impact of the MAR practice on the hydrodynamics and major ion chemistry of groundwater in the hyporheic zone compared to natural recharge. Besides, related geochemical processes including rock weathering and ion exchange showed increased effect on hyporheic hydrochemistry with aquifer depth, depending on hydrogeological conditions in addition to river water infiltration. Combined with hydrochemical indicators and the end-member mixing model, the relative contribution of precipitation to groundwater was estimated to be 5% for the 30-m aquifer, 16% for the 50-m aquifer, and 64% for the 80-m aquifer. However, precipitation made small contributions (<5%) to the major ions of groundwater regardless of depth. Conversely, the relative contributions of river water infiltration decreased with aquifer depth (95%-> 84%-> 36%), and its proportional contributions to major ions showed a similar trend (90%-> 84%-> 39%), which suggests reduced SW-GW interaction intensity with depth in the hyporheic zone. The major ion compositions of hyporheic groundwater tend towards river water after the long-term MAR practice, reflecting comprehensive effect of mixing and related geochemical processes. This study demonstrates the relevance of detailed studies at regional scale to understand anthropogenic effects from projects such as MAR on groundwater geochemistry especially in multi-aquifer systems.

AB  - Changes in soil temperature (ST) and soil moisture (SM) are essential for climate change and ecosystem assessments. Previous investigations on the ST and SM on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are mainly based on the situ observation and the satellite products. In this study, the improved Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), with proper parameter optimization and surface datasets update, is used to estimate the response of ST and SM in the TP to climate change in the long-term time series from 1961 to 2010. After validating the reasonability of the simulated results using the observations, the spatial distribution of changes in ST and SM in annual and seasonal time series since 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, are investigated respectively and the changes of precipitation (Pr) and surface evaporation (Ev) are also analysed to understand the cause of changes objectively. As a whole, the soil was warming and wetting at the maximum value of 0.31 degrees C/decade and 0.77%/decade since the 1960s. However, the warming process in soil mainly occurred in the 1980s while the wetting tendency is detected since the 1990s extensively. Except for the influence of air warming, the enhanced Pr and Ev might also be indispensable factors that caused the intensive wetting process but damped warming process in soil. Summer is the favourable season for the thermal and hydraulic variation since the 1980s. There exists the striking warmer and drier trend in the eastern TP since 1980s while the colder and wetter condition in the western TP since the 1990s. The magnitude of variation in soil is magnified from 1990s under the continuing impact of climate change.

AB  - Geo-hydrological risk reduction is a key issue for local governments in Italy. In this context, a collaboration was undertaken between multiple actors in the La Spezia municipality aimed at: (i) monitoring building characteristics, using specific and valuable indicators, and (ii) increasing the knowledge of geo-hydrological hazards across residents and local land planners (iii) implementing local emergency civil protection plan. An extensive mobile data collection was carried out through apps specifically developed for Android and IOS mobile devices. The digital forms were differentiated on the basis of the potential hazard: one of 46 fields and one of 125 fields designed for buildings respectively located in flood prone areas and in medium to very high landslide susceptibility areas. The digital version of the forms was designed using the Open Data Kit (ODK) and GISCloud client server approach. All the collected data, including geospatial locations and images, were automatically sent to a central server, stored and organized in a database. Geospatial data-analysis and maps resulted useful in evaluating possible impacts to exposed buildings to potential geo-hydrological processes. The proposed public participation method for data-gathering increased the knowledge across residents providing a better understanding of the urban systems, of the buildings condition and their relation respect to the geo-hydrological risk. The method can be considered as part of the decision support systems for civil protection purposes to better planning geo-hydrological mitigation measures. The application of mobile technology for data collection can be effectively used when local government resources are limited.

AB  - Protypotherium (Mammalia, Notoungulata, lnteratheriinae) is a well-known and very diverse genus of extinct native ungulates of South America, widely distributed from southern to middle latitudes of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia. This genus exhibits distinctive species throughout the Miocene to the beginning of the Pliocene that display an interesting size pattern. The large sample of specimens studied during several years of research allows us to analyze the shape and size of upper and lower molars for nine species of Protypotherium, in order to test the hypothesis of reduction of size ranges preserving a general tooth morphology as a response to climate deterioration, documented in South America by a marked reduction of temperature that occurred during Miocene times. Elliptic Fourier analyses were used to capture the shape of the occlusal morphology and the centroid size was also retained for subsequent analyses. Our results demonstrate that: 1) a similar morphological tooth pattern is observed among all species; 2) tooth shape variation is not associated with a change in size; and 3) there is a tendency to increase the size and decrease the number of species. This striking pattern could be correlated with a global trend to lower temperatures, which indicates a deterioration of paleoenvironmental conditions. A conservative tooth pattern, together with an increase of size and a reduction in number of species were the main evolutionary and ecological tendencies accounted in Protypotherium from the early to late Miocene-beginning of the Pliocene, which were accompanied by a latitudinal displacement from Patagonia to northern areas at the end of the Miocene.

AB  - The paper is devoted to the problem of creating highly reliable power supply systems for spacecrafts intended for long-term autonomous flights. Within its framework, the problem of synthesizing a control system for solar arrays is being solved. To solve this problem, a mathematical model of a solar panel was compiled, and a study of its static and dynamic characteristics was carried out. It was found that when the solar panel is controlled using a shunt switch with pulse-width modulation, resonance phenomena appear in the system, leading to an unacceptable change in the polarity of voltages on the photocells. The operating conditions of the solar panels, which exclude the occurrence of the indicated alternating voltages, are found, and appropriate recommendations are given for the choice of the quantization frequency in the system. On the basis of the recommendations received, the transition to a quasi-continuous representation of the control system was carried out, and a graphic-analytical synthesis of the controller providing the required quality indicators of the system was carried out. To ensure the survivability of the power supply system, a method is proposed for the hierarchical organization of the interaction of solar panels, which reproduces the homeostatic properties of biological structures in the system. This property is provided by automatic transfer of control to subsequent levels of the hierarchy as the energy resources of the previous levels are exhausted. In addition, selective control is applied only to that part of the total generated power, which is sufficient to counter the current disturbing influences on the system. This approach to control prevents cascading failures in the system. The paper presents simulation models on which all theoretical positions and methods proposed in the work are tested.

AB  - The tropical deciduous forest is threatened and disturbed by agricultural activities; however, their successional dynamics and regeneration potential it is still little known. The objective of this research was assessing the regenerative capacity of the secondary deciduous forests of a Forest Reserve in Chiapas through comparison changes in richness, diversity, composition, and structure indicators. Twenty 1000m(2) sampling plots were established in secondary forests with different ages of abandonment (10, 19, 35 and. 40 years). All woody plants with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were measured. Statistics about structure and diversity were calculated in each age-class; ANOVA and Tukey test (p< 0.05) were employed to detect differences between them. Changes in the floristic composition were evaluated through ordination and classification analysis. 142 species grouped into 96 genera and 41 families were recorded. Leguminosae was the family with more species and individuals. The species with the highest relative abundances were Montanoa tomentosa (5.1%) and Tecoma stans (5%). Significative differences were found (p < 0.05) in accumulated richness, diversity (Shannon - Weiner H ' and 1D), the density of individuals (ind ha(-1)), maximum height (m), basal area (m(2) ha(-1)) and aerial biomass (Mg ha(-1)). The permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed significative differences (p < 0.05) in species composition between early (10 years and 19 years) and more advanced conditions (35 and >40 years). Our results support the notion that secondary forests recover their composition and structure slowly. Therefore, it is essential to implement activities conducive to its conservation in the short term.

AB  - Urban functional zone (UFZ) comprises the basic unit of urban planning, with various production activities. Understanding the landscape heterogeneity in UFZs may be a way to mitigate urban heat island (UHI). The region within fifth ring road in Beijing is selected as the study area. Six common UFZ types were selected to understand the effects of three types of factors (surface biophysical parameters, building form, and landscape metrics) on land surface temperature (LST). A one-way analysis of variance and geographical detector were used to express spatial heterogeneity and key influencing factors of LST in UFZ, respectively. The results indicate the following: (1) the UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST, are industrial, commercial, public service, government, high-density residential, and recreational zones. The LST of industrial and recreational zones are significantly different from other zones, but other four types of UFZ exhibited similar thermal conditions. (2) The key influencing factors of LST in UFZs differ. Surface biophysical parameters have a significant effect on all UFZs. Building form in areas of high building height and density, such as commercial and high-density residential zones, should be the focus of UHI mitigation, whereas optimizing land cover composition and spatial configuration in other UFZs is more likely to alleviate LST. In addition, the LST is determined not only by the UFZ type and internal structure, but also by the complexity and diversity. Identifying UHI mitigation sensitivity metrics within UFZ will help improve the thermal environment of urban areas and provide strategies for resisting UHI.

AB  - Intensive pig management involves in a commercial setting the housing and implementation of certain procedures, such as castration and tail docking, which may be stressful for the animal. Good farming practices include the reduction of stress due to management processes, but assessing the level of stress perceived entirely through behavioural observations can be challenging. The monitoring stress-related physiological markers, like glucocorticoids (GC), can be an accurate alternative that would presumably be more objective. In order to avoid an additional stressor by taking blood, a non-invasive approach is advisable. We used an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test and the effect of transport to examine the suitability of different enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for monitoring adrenocortical function in domestic pigs using saliva and faeces as sample matrices. An assay measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) with a 3ss,11ss-diol group has proven suited to determine adrenocortical activity, showing an overall increase of 180% in fGCM concentrations related to ACTH administration and of 70% related to transport, respectively. A cortisol EIA was used to detect salivary glucocorticoid (sGC) concentrations, revealing a 1100% increase in sGC concentrations after ACTH administration. The stability of fGCM concentrations post-defecation was determined to assess possible changes in measured fGCM concentrations in unpreserved faecal material over time, with fGCM concentrations being relatively stable (maximal 12% change) under natural conditions for approximately two days after defecation. This implicates that untreated faecal material from pigs can be analysed for up to two days after collection without appreciable level of depreciation in fGCM concentrations. Being able to assess the physiological stress response of domestic pigs non-invasively can help to improve the well-being of commercially reared pigs.

AB  - Planktonic ciliate composition and distribution together with physicochemical variables were investigated in a shallow hypersaline lagoon, Pulicat, India, during three seasons, i.e., pre-monsoon (PRM), monsoon (MON), and post-monsoon (POM). The low freshwater inflow, evaporation, and closure of the lake mouth were the main factors for the hypersaline conditions in Pulicat Lake. The average depth and salinity were 1.8 +/- 0.12 m (0.8 to 2.8 m) and 35.3 +/- 1.68 (12.5 to 61), respectively. A total of 29 ciliate taxa belonging to 18 genera and five classes were identified. Strombidium conicum (24%) was the dominant species followed by Euplotes sp. (10.7%) and Stenosomella sp. (7.02%). Spirotrichea (84%) was the dominant class followed by Oligohymenophorea (9.6%) and Heterotrichea (5.8%). Fabrea salina, a typical species in hypersaline systems, was abundant at locations where the salinity was more than 35. Multivariate analysis using the Bray-Curtis similarity, followed by SIMPROF (Similarity Percentage Analysis), on ciliate abundance data revealed three ciliate assemblages characterizing south, central, and north of the lake at 40% similarity (SIMPROF, cophenetic correlation = 0.622, P = 5%). Both ciliate abundance and chlorophyll-a were positively correlated with salinity. Species richness and evenness were higher in the south sector when compared with those in the other two sectors. Biotic-environmental interaction through canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) inferred that the combined effects of salinity, chlorophyll-a, and nutrient levels are the key factors responsible for the distribution of the ciliate species, suggesting that ciliates can be considered to be potential bioindicators of water quality.

AB  - Air quality data from Bogota, Colombia, show high levels ofparticulate matter(PM), which often generate respiratory problems to the population and a high economic cost to the government. Since 2016, air quality in the city of Bogota has been measured through theBogota Air Quality Index(IBOCA) which works as an indicator of environmental risk due to air pollution. However, available technological tools in Bogota are not enough to generate early alerts due to PM(10)and PM2.5. Currently, alerts are only announced once the measured PM values exceed a certain standard (e.g., 37 mu g/m(3)), but not with enough anticipation to efficiently protect the population. It is necessary to develop an early air quality alert in Bogota, in order to provide information that improves risk management protocols in the capital district. The purpose of this investigation is to validate thecorrectivealertpresented on the 14th and 15th of February of 2019, through the WRF-Chem model under different weather conditions, using three different setups of the model to simulate PM(10)and PM(2.5)concentrations during two different climatic seasons and different resolutions. The results of this article generate a validation of two configurations of the model that can be used for the Environmental Secretary of the District (SDA) forecasts in Bogota, Colombia, in order to contribute to the prediction of pollution events produced by PM(10)and PM(2.5)as a tool for anearly alert system(EAS) at least 24 h in advance.

AB  - The huge usage of rechargeable batteries in electronics has added to a recurrent problem worldwide in generating tonnage of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The inadequacy of the resources of the depleting critical metals has also been described in vogue. The environmental assessment of the life cycle of the LIBs has been elucidated vis-a-vis the effects of raw material supply, transportation, and recycling. Based on the available work for recycling technologies, this review also attempts to elicit the various methods practiced in discharging/dismantling, classification, and separation of components followed by metal recovery. The authors have reviewed the major developments in the area of recycling of cathode material by using various acids for extraction of metals from spent LIBs, compared the merits and demerits of acids used and presented a comprehensive outlook to the processes formulated vis-a-vis imperative need for using green techniques. The necessity for benign recycling methods is stressed upon to alleviate the need for high temperature and oxidative acid leaching conditions. The various green lixiviants (organic acids) attempted to extract metals from spent LIBs have been discussed in detail with respect to the mechanism, efficacies as well as the various factors (selectivity, cost, etc.) that govern the use of organic acids in battery recycling. It was ascertained that the GHG emissions to extract Co using organic acids stand 1/8 of that using an inorganic acid leaching process. Efforts need to be envisaged in separating the leached metals from these lixiviants ensuring economics and environmental benefits. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jeddah represents the second largest city in Saudi Arabia and has more than 3.5 million residents. The daily estimated water used per capita is 200 L. The absence of a well-done network of sewage in some places especially in south Jeddah (Old Jeddah) considered a serious environment. In Jeddah, the potable water used for municipal purposes is mostly returning to the surrounding environments as wastewater (e.g., Al-Musk Lake). The site Al-Musk Lake uses as sewage dumping lake without any purification processes till the year 2010. The wastewater of this lake caused various environmental dangers owing to heavy metal contamination of surface sediments, groundwater, soil and air. Its areal distribution has been increased during last 17 years (2000-2017). Its surface fine-grained sediments are including a huge amount of heavy metals and organic contaminants owing to accumulation of sewage water during the last two decades. The climate of the Saudi Arabia is mostly dry hot continental condition so that, the topmost clayey sediments of this lake are enriched in pollutants. That means, wind will carry these pollutants directly to Jeddah and the surrounding regions and are inhaled by residing citizens in these regions during respiration and thus could cause a variety of respiratory diseases or other infections. Owing to accumulation of sewage water-bearing organic materials during last 17 years, Al-Musk Lake subsurface sediments contain considerable amounts of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, As, Cu, Co and Hg) and organic materials. The organic matter content (OMC) of the studied surface soil samples varies from 4.2 to 11.3%. The OMC has a significant strong relationship with both silt and clay contents of the studied soil samples.

AB  - Technical and sustainability analyses of the methanol production via the integrated biomass pyrolysis, gasification, and methanol synthesis (IBPGM) process using rice straw as feedstock, are performed. The utilization of emitted CO2 by recycling to a gasifier as a gasifying agent is investigated for technical and environmental reasons. The effects of CO2 recirculation on the product distribution and energy consumption of the IBPGM process are examined. The production rate of methanol is improved with the increased CO2 recycle fraction, while that of bio-oil does not change. The IBPGM is a highly exothermic process, with the largest energy-releasing unit being the methanol reactor. The energy consumption at the gasifier exhibits the same trend and thermal self-sufficiency is consequently achieved when the recycle fraction is raised to 0.76. Environmental assessment using a life cycle analysis tool reveals that the energy management of methanol synthesis unit and syngas processor needs to be improved as they highly contribute toward the carbon footprint and potential environmental impact. The technical and environmental factors of the IBPGM process are evaluated by the analysis hierarchy process, calculated by a multi-criteria decision analysis method. The IBPGM process with the CO2 recycle fraction of 0.2 offers the best performance. Under this condition, the methanol and bio-oil production rates of 0.23 and 0.09 kmol h(-1), respectively, and the energy efficiency of 60.7% can be achieved, based on the biomass feed rate of 1 kmol h(-1).

However, it is difficult to test the sensory ecology and spatial orientation ability of large highly migratory fishes in the field. Therefore, we performed behavioral conditioning experiments on a small magnetically sensitive species, the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis), in the laboratory. We trained individuals to use the polarity, or the north-south direction, of the GMF as a cue to orient in space and navigate a T-maze for a food reward. Subjects were split into two groups that learned to associate the direction of magnetic north or south as the indicator of the reward location. Stingrays reached the learning criterion within a mean (+/- SE) of 158.6 +/- 28.4 trials. Subjects were then reverse trained to use the previously unrewarded magnetic stimulus of the opposite polarity as the new cue for the reward location. Overall, the stingrays reached the reversal criterion in significantly fewer trials (120 +/- 13.8) compared to the initial procedure. These data show that the yellow stingray can learn to associate changes in GMF polarity with a reward, relearn a behavioral task when the reward contingency is modified, and learn a reversal procedure faster than the initial association. These data support the idea that the yellow stingray, and perhaps other elasmobranchs, might use GMF polarity as a cue to orient and maintain a heading during navigation.

AB  - The Arctic ecosystem has a huge reservoir of soil organic carbon stored in permafrost-affected soils and biosediments. During the short vegetation season, humification and mineralization processes in the active soil layer result in the formation of specific soil organic substances - humic substances. Humic acids are high molecular, specific, thermodynamically stable macromolecules. The study was conducted in the Lena River Delta, the largest river delta located in the Arctic. Cryosol-type soils on alluvial deposits of the river form an area of about 45 thousand km(2) under permafrost conditions. The vegetation cover is represented by moss-lichen communities with the presence of Salix glauca in the flooded areas, as well as Betula nana in the areas not subject to flooding. The paper presents the elemental and molecular composition of humic acids isolated from soils, integral indicators of humification (stabilization) of organic matter in the soils of the Lena River Delta. The study was conducted using the C-13 (CP/MAS) NMR spectroscopy method. In the work, it was revealed that up to 33% of aromatic and up to 15% COOR fragments are accumulated in humic acids. The AR/AL ratio ranged from 0.69 to 0.89. The studied soils are variants of modern soil formation (not subjected to alluvial processes) and soil-like bodies that melted from the IC of the river delta. A relatively high degree of condensation of humic acid macromolecules in comparison with other polar regions of the Arctic and Antarctic was noted.

AB  - We present the first complete dataset of partition coefficients of Rare Earth Elements (REE) between oldhamites or molten FeS and silicate melts. Values have been determined at 1300 and 1400 degrees C from experiments on mixtures of a natural enstatite chondrite and sulphides powders (FeS or CaS) performed in evacuated silica tubes for different f(O2) conditions (from IW-6.9 to IW-4.1). Obtained REE partitioning values are between 0.5 and 5 for oldhamites and between 0.001 and 1 for FeS. In both sulphides, Eu and Yb are preferentially incorporated compared to neighbouring REE. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure measurements on Yb and Sm demonstrate the partial reduction to 2+ valence state for both elements, Yb reduction being more pronounced. Therefore, the Yb anomaly in the sulphides is interpreted to be an effect of the presence of Yb2+ in the system and the amplitude of the anomaly increases with decreasing oxygen fugacity. The obtained oldhamite/silicate melt partition coefficients patterns are unlike any of the observed data in natural oldhamites from enstatite chondrites and achondrites. In particular, the low values do not explain the observed enrichments in oldhamite crystals. However, positive Eu and Yb anomalies are observed in some oldhamites from EH chondrites and aubrites. We attribute these anomalies found in meteorites to the sole oldhamite control on REE budget. We conclude that the presence of positive Eu and Yb anomalies in oldhamites is a good indicator of their primordial character and that these oldhamites carry a condensation signature from a highly reduced nebular gas.

AB  - Coastal megacities deposit significant amounts of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and pollutants into surrounding waters. In urbanized estuaries, these inputs, including wastewater discharge and surface runoff, can affect biogeochemical cycles, microbial production, and greenhouse gas (GHG) efflux. To better understand estuarine GHG production and its connection to anthropogenic drivers, we quantified carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) surface-water concentrations and efflux in combination with a suite of biogeochemical parameters, including anthropogenic indicators, in the Hudson River Estuary (HRE) and adjacent waters surrounding New York, NY, over a 2-yr period. The HRE was a source of both CO2 (33 +/- 3 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) and CH4 (177 +/- 22 mu mol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) under all measured conditions. Surface-water salinity, oxygen saturation, fecal indicator bacteria, nitrate concentrations, and temperature best explained the variance in CO2 and CH4 concentrations in multiple regression analyses, producing robust predictive power for both GHGs. Our multifaceted data set demonstrated that CH4 and CO2 surface concentrations are explained in part by enterococci concentrations, a widely used wastewater biological indicator, explicitly linking wastewater inputs to GHG surface concentrations in the HRE. The greatest CO2 and CH4 surface-water concentrations were found in urban tributaries and embayments, primary wastewater delivery areas throughout the HRE. Estuarine tributaries and embayments have historically received less research attention than midchannel sites, but since these shallow sites may contribute to increased GHG efflux in anthropogenically impacted estuaries, further study is warranted.

AB  - Ecosystem services provided by contemporary landscapes are different from those of the past, and this difference is influenced by the legacies of policies that incentivized wetland drainage without considering the impact on ecosystem services. Heterogeneity in ecosystem service legacies is rarely acknowledged or documented. Even less understood is the relative role of historical wetland type (e.g., swamps, fens) and contemporary land cover in shaping these heterogeneous outcomes. Here, we contrasted contemporary ecosystem services with a scenario of no wetland drainage in the Ruamahanga Basin, New Zealand, a region historically rich in wetlands. Using the high-resolution Land Use Capability Indicator model, we mapped nitrogen retention, phosphorous retention, sediment retention, agricultural productivity, and flood mitigation at a 5-m spatial resolution under these two scenarios. Our work supports the broad understanding that agricultural productivity has increased in contemporary landscapes, while flood mitigation and nutrient retention have decreased. Net losses in ecosystem services occurred for the majority of historical wetlands, while net gains were less common. However, spatially heterogeneous and divergent responses of ecosystem services to land cover changes reinforced the need for high-resolution models to untangle the range of factors affecting ecosystem service provisioning. Contemporary land cover explained very little variation in ecosystem services. Initial conditions, however, played an important role in determining ecosystem service outcomes with losses of swamps being particularly problematic for net loss of ecosystem services provisioning. The maps we produced, and the algorithms underlying them, provide tools to envision both local- and broad-scale effects of historical wetland drainage.

AB  - In the past 25 years, researchers have discovered that Virtual Reality (VR) is an effective tool for mental health treatment and assessment in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. Moreover, VR is also an effective assessment tool with practical applications that range from social and cognitive deficits to addiction. Nevertheless, despite progress, evidence-based psychological treatments still need improvement. In this paper we suggest that the integration of VR with another emerging technology - Artificial Intelligence (AI) - will provide clinicians with two new powerful tools for improving evidence-based psychological treatments: advanced digital therapeutics and digital biomarkers. The term "Digital Therapeutics" indicates the use of digital/online health technologies to treat a medical or psychological condition. Following this definition, any VR clinical application can be defined as a form of digital therapeutics. However, the integration between VR al Al allows a critical feature for any digital therapeutic: personalization. On one side, VR allows the collection of "Digital Biomarkers" - physiological, and behavioral data that are collected by means of digital technologies and used as an indicator of biologic processes or biological responses to therapeutic interventions - that are directly connected to the brain functioning and can be altered to correct the specific dysfunctions of the predictive coding mechanisms in the individual's brain. On the other side Al, by applying machine learning techniques to the individual's digital biomarkers, allows the optimization the individual treatment strategy facilitating the transition to a personalized, effective and engaging medicine.

AB  - The present study examined annually and seasonally trends in climate-based and location-based indices after detection of artificial change points and application of homogenization. Thirteen temperature and eight precipitation indices were generated at 27 meteorological stations over Iran during 1961-2012. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were applied for trend detection. Results revealed that almost all indices based on minimum temperature followed warmer conditions. Indicators based on minimum temperature showed less consistency with more cold and less warm events. Climate-based results for all extremes indicated semi-arid climate had the most warming events. Moreover, based on location-based results, inland areas showed the most signs of warming. Indices based on precipitation exhibited a negative trend in warm seasons, with the most changes in coastal areas and inland, respectively. Results provided evidence of warming and drying since the 1990s. Changes in precipitation indices were much weaker and less spatially coherent. Summer was found to be the most sensitive season, in comparison with winter. For arid and semi-arid regions, by increasing the latitude, less warm events occurred, while increasing the longitude led to more warming events. Overall, Iran is dominated by a significant increase in warm events, especially minimum temperature-based indices (nighttime). This result, in addition to fewer precipitation events, suggests a generally dryer regime for the future, which is more evident in the warm season of semi-arid sites. The results could provide beneficial references for water resources and eco-environmental policymakers.

AB  - Ventilation systems are amongst the most essential components of a mine. As the indicators of ventilation systems are in general of ambiguity or uncertainty, the selection of ventilation systems can therefore be regarded as a complex fuzzy decision making problem. In order to solve such problems, a decision making framework based on a new concept, the hesitant linguistic preference relation (HLPR), is constructed. The basic elements in the HLPR are hesitant fuzzy linguistic numbers (HFLNs). At first, new operational laws and aggregation operators of HFLNs are defined to overcome the limitations in existing literature. Subsequently, a novel comparison method based on likelihood is proposed to obtain the order relationship of two HFLNs. Then, a likelihood-based consistency index is introduced to represent the difference between two hesitant linguistic preference relations (HLPRs). It is a new way to express the consistency degree for the reason that the traditional consistency indices are almost exclusively based on distance measures. Meanwhile, a consistency-improving model is suggested to attain acceptable consistent HLPRs. In addition, a method to receive reasonable ranking results from HLPRs with acceptable consistency is presented. At last, this method is used to pick out the best mine ventilation system under uncertain linguistic decision conditions. A comparison and a discussion are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the presented approach. The results show that the proposed method is effective for selecting the optimal mine ventilation system, and provides references for the construction and management of mines.

AB  - Understanding fecal indicator bacteria persistence in aquatic environments is important when making management decisions to improve instream water quality. Routinely, bacteria fate and transport models that rely on published kinetic decay constants are used to inform such decision making but may not adequately represent instream conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate bacterial responses to applied nutrient amendments and provide additional information regarding bacterial response to applied changes that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts. Re-created stream mesocosms were established in laboratory-based, repurposed algae raceways filled with water and sediment from a small, 3rd order Southeast Texas stream. Mesocosm treatments consisted of low (10x) or high (50x) nutrient doses above ambient water concentrations operated at low (0.032 m/s) or high (0.141 m/s) flow rates. Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacterial concentrations were quantified in water and sediment over 22 days. No significant differences in kinetic constants were observed among E. coli in water or sediment, and only E. coli in sediment showed any growth response. Heterotrophic plate counts revealed a pronounced growth response in water and sediment within 24 h of nutrient addition but did not differ significantly from control mesocosms. Significant kinetic constant differences between E. coli and heterotrophic bacteria in water were identified (p < 0.01) but did not differ significantly in sediment (p > 0.48). Results indicate that nutrient addition does affect microbial numbers instream, but competition from heterotrophic bacteria may prevent an E. coli growth response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A combined investigation of bulk geochemistry and molecular geochemistry was carried out on 31 source rock samples from the Lower Permian Lucaogou Formation, in the Jimsar Sag of the Junggar Basin, northwestern China. Geochemical characterization reveals the depositional environments and other factors favorable for the generation and accumulation off beta-carotane, an important hydrocarbon precursor. Many core samples have a total organic carbon content >1%, and Rock-Eval S-2 values >2 mg HC/g rock, suggesting relatively high hydrocarbon generation potential. Biomarkers in the Lucaogou source rock extracts are characterized by short- to long chain n-alkanes, a wide range of Pr/Ph ratios (0.74-1.42) and beta-carotane index values beta-carotane/C-max, 0.16-1.92), high concentrations of C-29 sterane, relatively low tricyclic terpane content, and moderate gammacerane index values (0.14-0.29). This is consistent with a weakly oxidizing to weakly reducing depositional environment, with fresh to brackish water conditions, rapid input of terrigenous organic matter, and a relatively small contribution of aquatic algal-bacterial organic matter. Cross-plots of biomarker parameters and the beta-carotane index show that beta-carotane in the Lucaogou source rocks is mainly derived from terrigenous organic matter, and is found predominantly in sediments deposited in weakly reducing, brackish environments. It does not appear to have been affected by thermal maturation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present investigation the explosion characteristics of 30% H-2/70% CH4-blended fuels have been experimentally studied in different turbulent environments. Some important indicators about the explosion characteristics, including maximum explosion pressure (pmax), explosion duration (tc), maximum rate of pressure rise ((dp/dt) max), deflagration index (KG), and fast burn period (tb) have been studied. Furthermore, the influences of turbulent intensity associated with the equivalence ratio on explosion characteristics have been compressively analysed. The results indicated that, with the increase of turbulent intensity (u'rms), the value of pmax will be correspondingly raised while the equivalent ratio (f) corresponding to the peak value of pmax gradually changes from stoichiometric to 1.2. Based upon the value of pmax in laminar condition, the growth extent of pmax monotonically rises to u'rms, but under a same u'rms the growth extent of pmax first declines and then rises with the increase of f in the rage of 0.6 to 1.2. Under a laminar environment, the peak value of (dp/dt) max is attained at rho = 1.0; although such a conclusion is maintained in the studied range of turbulent intensity, the difference on the value of (dp/dt) max between rho = 1.0 and rho = 1.2 is obviously reduced with the increase of u'rms. Meanwhile, from the variation of KG, it could be found that turbulence can raise the hazardous potential of disaster. With the increase of u'rms, both the values of tc and tb reduce, the quota of tb in the explosion performs a similar regulation, but the detailed variation extent is also controlled by u'rms.

AB  - The leaf carbon isotope ratio (C-13) is a useful parameter for predicting a plant's water use efficiency, as an indicator for plant classification, and even in the reconstruction of paleoclimatic environments. In this study, we investigated the spatial pattern of leaf C-13 values and its relationship with plant functional groups and environmental factors throughout China. The high leaf C-13 in the database appeared in central and western China, and the averaged leaf C-13 was -27.15, with a range from -21.05 to -31.5. The order of the averaged C-13 for plant life forms from most positive to most negative was subshrubs>herbs=shrubs>trees>subtrees. Leaf C-13 is also influenced by some environmental factors, such as mean annual precipitation, relative humidity, mean annual temperature, solar hours, and altitude, although the overall influences are still relatively weak, in particular the influence of MAT and altitude. And we further found that plant functional types are dominant factors that regulate the magnitude of leaf C-13 for an individual site, whereas environmental conditions are key to understanding spatial patterns of leaf C-13 when we consider China as a whole. Ultimately, we conducted a multiple regression model of leaf C-13 with environmental factors and mapped the spatial distribution of leaf C-13 in China by using this model. However, this partial least squares model overestimated leaf C-13 for most life forms, especially for deciduous trees, evergreen shrubs, and subtrees, and thus need more improvement in the future.

AB  - Understanding indirect, trophic-level effects of genetically engineered plants, expressing insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), is essential to the ecological risk assessment process. In this study, we examine potential indirect, trophic-level effects of Bt-sensitive prey using the predator, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), feeding upon Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) larvae, which had delayed development (lower body mass) following ingestion of Cry1Ab maize leaves. We found no adverse effects on development and survival when H. axyridis larvae were fed S. frugiperda larvae that had fed on Cry1Ab maize tissue. Presence of Cry1Ab in H. axyridis decreased considerably after switching to another diet within 48 h. In a no-choice assay, H. axyridis larvae consumed more Bt-fed S. frugiperda than non-Bt-fed larvae. Preference for S. frugiperda feeding on Bt maize was confirmed in subsequent choice assays with H. axyridis predation on Bt-fed, 1-5-d-old S. frugiperda larvae. We suggest that H. axyridis preferred prey, not based on whether it had fed on Bt or non-Bt maize, but rather on larval mass, and they compensated for the nutritional deficiency of lighter larvae through increased consumption. Pest larvae with variable levels of resistance developing on Bt diet are often stunted versus sensitive larvae developing on non-Bt diet. It is possible that such larvae may be preferentially removed from local field populations. These results may have implications for insect resistance management and may be played out under field conditions where seed blends of Bt and non-Bt hybrids are planted.

AB  - The environmental contamination risk can be evaluated in a specific area by approximating the probability that the pollutant under study exceeds a critical value. This issue requires the estimation of the distribution function involved, which can be addressed by applying the indicator kriging methodology or by approximating the sill of the variogram of the underlying indicator process. These approaches demand an appropriate characterization of the indicator variogram, which in turn requires a previous specification of the trend function, if the latter is suspected to be nonconstant. Because accuracy of the results will be strongly dependent on the adequate approximation of both functions, we suggest proceeding in a different way to avoid these requirements. Thus, in this paper, two kernel-type estimators are proposed, on the basis of first approximating the distribution at the sampled sites and then obtaining a weighted average of the resulting values, to derive a valid estimator at each (sampled or unsampled) location. Consistency of the kernel approaches is proved under rather general conditions, such as local stationarity and the existence of derivatives up to the second order of the distribution function. Numerical studies have been carried out to illustrate the performance of our proposals when compared to those procedures requiring the approximation of the indicator variogram. In a final step, the kernel-type estimation of the distribution function has been applied to map the risk of contamination by arsenic in the Central Region of Portugal. With this aim, biomonitoring data of arsenic concentrations were used to detect those zones with higher risk of arsenic accumulation, which is mainly located on the northern part of the region.

AB  - Afromontane landscapes are typically characterized by a mosaic of smallholder farms and the biodiversity impacts of these practices will vary in accordance to local management and landscape context. Here, we assess how tropical butterfly diversity is maintained across an agricultural landscape in the Jimma Highlands of Ethiopia. We used transect surveys to sample understory butterfly communities within degraded natural forest, semi-managed coffee forest (SMCF), exotic timber plantations, open woodland, croplands and pasture. Surveys were conducted in 29 one-hectare plots and repeated five times between January and June 2013. We found that natural forest supports higher butterfly diversity than all agricultural plots (measured with Hill's numbers). SMCF and timber plantations retain relatively high abundance and diversity, but these metrics drop off sharply in open woodland, cropland and pasture. SMCF and timber plantations share the majority of their species with natural forest and support an equivalent abundance of forest-dependent species, with no increase in widespread species. There was some incongruence in the responses of families and sub-families, notably that Lycaenidae are strongly associated with open woodland and pasture. Adult butterflies clearly utilize forested agricultural practices such as SMCF and timber plantations, but species diversity declines steeply with distance from natural forest suggesting that earlier life-stages may depend on host plants and/or microclimatic conditions that are lost under agricultural management. From a management perspective, the protection of natural forest remains a priority for tropical butterfly conservation, but understanding functioning of the wider landscape mosaic is important as SMCF and timber plantations may act as habitat corridors that facilitate movement between forest fragments.

AB  - The formation of the skidding trail system when thinning and selective cuttings of mature and over-mature forest stands reduces the performance of stands as a result of the corridors cutting and mechanical deformation of soil in the process of moving of the skidding equipment. Reducing the density of the skidding trails in the selection thinning of forest stands is reached by timber skidding to the runways by mini tractors working under the forest stand canopy. This is provided by dimensions and maneuverability of mini tractors corresponding to the density of the forest stands. The possibility and feasibility of mini tractors should be defined taking into account the environmental, social and economic criteria. The one-hour efficiency is considered as the most informative criterion for assessing the skidding mini tractor effectiveness when selecting the schemes of its moving. Its maximum under otherwise equal conditions is reached in the formation of a full load and minimum value of idling. The schemes of the mini tractor moving between skidding trails in cutting strip, of shuttle runs, parallel and perpendicular to the skidding trails in cutting strip are considered as the variants of mini tractor moving under the canopy of the forest stand. A limitation on the use of schemes is the maneuvering steepness at the given dimensions of mini tractors, skidding timber length and density of the stand. Recommendations for the use of the moving schemes take into account the ratio of weight-carrying capacity of the mini tractor, large-scale cutting trees and the possibility of forming of full-load package with a minimum displacement distance.

AB  - A significant barrier to the assessment of ecosystem services is a lack of primary data, especially for cultural ecosystem services. Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300 m resolution) and CORINE (100 m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services.

AB  - Climate change will worsen the high levels of urban vulnerability in Latin American cities due to specific environmental stressors. Some impacts of climate change, such as high temperatures in urban environments, have not yet been addressed through adaptation strategies, which are based on poorly supported data. These impacts remain outside the scope of urban planning. New spatially explicit approaches that identify highly vulnerable urban areas and include specific adaptation requirements are needed in current urban planning practices to cope with heat hazards. In this paper, a heat vulnerability index is proposed for Santiago, Chile. The index was created using a GIS-based spatial information system and was constructed from spatially explicit indexes for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity levels derived from remote sensing data and socio-economic information assessed via principal component analysis (PCA). The objective of this study is to determine the levels of heat vulnerability at local scales by providing insights into these indexes at the intra city scale. The results reveal a spatial pattern of heat vulnerability with strong variations among individual spatial indexes. While exposure and adaptive capacities depict a clear spatial pattern, sensitivity follows a complex spatial distribution. These conditions change when examining PCA results, showing that sensitivity is more robust than exposure and adaptive capacity. These indexes can be used both for urban planning purposes and for proposing specific policies and measures that can help minimize heat hazards in highly dynamic urban areas. The proposed methodology can be applied to other Latin American cities to support policy making.

AB  - Deep-sea sediments represent the largest geological deposit on Earth and provide a record of our planet's response to conditions at the sea surface from where the bulk of material originates. We use a machine learning method to analyze how the distribution of 14,400 deep-sea sediment sample lithologies is connected to bathymetry and surface oceanographic parameters. Our probabilistic Gaussian process classifier shows that the geographic occurrence of five major lithologies in the world's ocean can be predicted using just three parameters. Sea-surface salinity and temperature provide a major control for the growth and composition of plankton and specific ranges are also associated with the influx of non-aerosol terrigenous material into the ocean, while bathymetry is an important parameter for discriminating the occurrence of calcareous sediment, clay and coarse lithogenous sediment from each other. We find that calcareous and siliceous oozes are not linked to high surface productivity. Diatom and radiolarian oozes are associated with low salinities at the surface but with discrete ranges of temperatures, reflecting the diversity of planktonic species in different climatic zones. Biosiliceous sediments cannot be used to infer paleodepth, but are good indicators of paleotemperature and paleosalinity. Our analysis provides a new framework for constraining paleosurface ocean environments from the geological record of deep-sea sediments. It shows that small shifts in salinity and temperature significantly affect the lithology of seafloor sediment. As deep-sea sediments represent the largest carbon sink on Earth these shifts need to be considered in the context of global ocean warming.

AB  - The European green crab, Carcinus maenas, is a globally invasive species with detrimental impacts on the ecology and economy in affected areas, and the focus of many studies has been to examine both its ecology and physiology to gain a better understanding of this invasiveness. Green crabs exhibit a ventral color change from green to yellow then orange to red as they progress through intermolt. Previous studies documented red color phase males as less tolerant to environmental stress, but cellular-and molecular-level investigations into sex differences in regard to these color phases are lacking. In this study, red and green color phases of both sexes were exposed to low salinity (10 ppt) and assessed for whole animal performance, and indicators of cellular stress and energy status were measured in the gills as mRNA and protein expression. Red phase individuals exhibited poorer whole animal performance during low salinity exposure, where females outperformed males. Consistently, higher hemolymph osmolality in green phase animals was facilitated through increased mRNA expression of ion transport drivers in both sexes, but females showed elevated mRNA levels under control conditions with subsequently diminished upregulation during low salinity exposure. Differential physiological responses can have a significant impact on future invasions of this species. The approach in this study highlights the increased resilience of female animals in both color phases revealing that taking the molt cycle and sex-dependent variability into account is crucial for understanding and predicting the success of future invasions.

AB  - Ants have been used to assess land use conversion, because they reflect environmental change, and their response to these changes have been useful in the identification of bioindicators. We evaluated ant diversity and composition associated to different land use change in a temperate forest (above 2000 m asl) in Mexico. The study was carried out in "Flor del Bosque" Park a vegetation mosaic of native Oak Forests and introduced Eucalyptus and grasslands. Species richness, dominance and diversity rarefaction curves, based on ant morphospecies and functional groups, were constructed and compared among the three vegetation types, for the rainy and the dry seasons of 2008-2009. Jaccard and Sorensen incidence-based indices were calculated to obtain similarity values among all the habitats. The Oak Forest was a rich dominant community, both in species and functional groups; the Eucalyptus plantation was diverse with low dominance. The most seasonality habitat was the grassland, with low species and high functional group diversity during the dry seasons, but the reverse pattern during the wet season. The Oak Forest was more similar to the Eucalyptus plantation than to the grassland, particularly during the dry season. Oak Forests are dominated by Cold Climate Specialists, specifically Prenolepis imparis (Say). The Eucalyptus and the grassland are characterized by generalized Myrmicinae, as Pheidole spp. and Monomorium ebenium (Forel). The conservation of the native Oak Forest is primordial for the maintenance of Cold Climate Specialist ant communities. The microclimatic conditions in this forest, probably, prevented the invasion by opportunistic species.

AB  - This document presents the WAter COlor from Digital Images (WACODI) algorithm, which extracts the color of natural waters from images collected by low-cost digital cameras, in the context of participatory science and water quality monitoring. SRGB images are converted to the CIE XYZ color space, undergoing a gamma expansion and illumination correction that includes the specular reflection at the air-water interface. The XYZ values obtained for each pixel of the image are converted to chromaticity coordinates and Hue color angle ((w)), which is a measure of color. Based on the distributions of (w) in sub-sections of the image, an approximation of the intrinsic color of the water is obtained. This algorithm was applied to images acquired in 2013 during two field campaigns in Northern Europe. The Hue color angles were derived from hyperspectral measurements above and below the surface, carried out simultaneously with image acquisition. When for each station a specific illumination correction was applied, based on the corresponding hyperspectral data, a good fit (r(2)=0.93) was obtained between the image and the spectra Hue color angles (slope=0.98, intercept=-0.03). When a more generic illumination correction was applied to the same images, based on the sky conditions at the time of the image acquisition (either overcast or sunny), a slightly inferior, but still satisfactory fit resulted. Results on the application of the WACODI algorithm to the first images collected by the public via the smartphone application or APP, developed within the European FP7 Citclops, are presented at the end of this study.

AB  - Unburned carbon (UC) in 21 combustion residues from solid biofuels has been examined using several methods of analysis (including LOI and TOC) as well as micro-Raman spectroscopy. The concentration of unburned carbon in the residues varied over an order of magnitude and in several samples accounted for about 10% of the ash mass. It was observed that TOC had a poor correlation to organic carbon, especially for fly ashes. LOI at all tested temperatures showed a better correlation than TOC to the organic carbon content, whereas the TOC is better correlated to elemental carbon. LOI550 gave a larger variation and a less complete mobilisation of unburned carbon than LOI at 750 or 975 degrees C did, but at the highest temperature metal oxidation was notably affecting the mass balance to the extent that some samples gained mass. For this reason, and of the temperatures tested, LOI750 seem to be the most stable indicator for organic remains in the incineration residuals. Most of the unburned carbon is elemental, and only slowly degradable, so the potential emissions of organic compounds from ashes should not be assessed by using a TOC test. The structure of the detected elemental carbon in UC is similar to that of activated carbon, which indicates a potentially large specific surface. This should be borne in mind when assessing the environmental impact of using ash for different purposes, including use as a construction material. Field studies are needed to verify the actual impact as it may depend on environmental conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Compulsive drug use and a persistent vulnerability to relapse are key features of addiction. Imaging studies have suggested that these features may result from deficits in prefrontal cortical structure and function, and thereby impaired top-down inhibitory control over limbic-striatal mechanisms of drug-seeking behaviour. We tested the hypothesis that selective damage to distinct subregions of the prefrontal cortex, or to the amygdala, after a short history of cocaine taking would: (i) result in compulsive cocaine seeking at a time when it would not usually be displayed; or (ii) facilitate relapse to drug seeking after abstinence. Rats with selective, bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the basolateral amygdala or anterior cingulate, prelimbic, infralimbic, orbitofrontal or anterior insular cortices were trained to self-administer cocaine under a seeking-taking chained schedule. Intermittent mild footshock punishment of the cocaine-seeking response was then introduced. No prefrontal cortical lesion affected the ability of rats to withhold their seeking responses. However, rats with lesions to the basolateral amygdala increased their cocaine-seeking responses under punishment and were impaired in their acquisition of conditioned fear. Following a 7-day abstinence period, rats were re-exposed to the drug-seeking environment for assessment of relapse in the absence of punishment or cocaine. Rats with prelimbic cortex lesions showed decreased seeking responses during relapse, whereas those with anterior insular cortex lesions showed an increase. Combined, these results show that acute impairment of prefrontal cortical function does not result in compulsive cocaine seeking after a short history of self-administering cocaine, but further implicates subregions of the prefrontal cortex in relapse.

AB  - Leaves of Phragmites communis were collected from five sampling sites distributed across three climatic zones in NE China, each zone representing a different level of humidity. A total of 4372 phytolith particles were counted from the leaves and classified into six types. The types of phytoliths are saddle, lanceolate, bulliform, and rondels, elongated, favose. Phytoliths in P. communis are sensitive to change in humidity. The main types from the five sampling sites are identical. The proportion of saddle phytoliths is greater than other phytoliths types. However, the quantity of phytoliths in P. communis differs markedly across the five sampling sites. In Shalan, Changchun, and Changling, the corresponding proportions of the saddle type are 28.1%, 25.4%, and 37.6%. In samples representing the aquatic, seasonal waterlogged, and mesic sampling sites from Nanhu Lake in Changchun, the corresponding proportions for saddle phytoliths are 32.6%, 20.6%, and 23.0%. The size of phytoliths, tested by CA, VA and PCA, to some extent indicates that the humidity is the main factor affecting the phytoliths. In Shalan, Changchun, and Changling, as humidity decreases, the phytoliths grow larger. In Nanhu Lake, as humidity decreases, the phytoliths grow smaller. The result reveals that phytoliths in P. communis are both sensitive to temperature and humidity. For regional research, temperature is the most important factor in the formation of phytoliths. Lanceolate phytoliths are sensitive to habitat change, and the saddle phytoliths are also sensitive to regional differences. Compared with the long cell phytoliths, short cell phytoliths as a proxy indicator of paleoclimate are more convincing. Overall, the results confirm that humidity is one of the dominant variables controlling the formation of phytoliths, which provides a new thinking for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.

AB  - Accurately estimating biological sex from the human skeleton can be especially difficult for fragmentary or incomplete remains often encountered in bioarchaeological contexts. Where typical anatomically dimorphic skeletal regions are incomplete or absent, observers often take their best guess to classify biological sex. Latent profile analysis (LPA) is a mixture modeling technique which uses observed continuous data to estimate unobserved categorical group membership using posterior probabilities. In this study, sex is the latent variable (male and female are the two latent classes), and the indicator variables used here were eight standard linear measurements (long bone lengths, diaphyseal and articular breadths, and circumferences). Mplus (Muthen and Muthen: Mplus user's guide, 6th ed. Los Angeles: Muthen & Muthen, 2010) was used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates for latent class membership from a known sample of individuals from the forensic data bank (FDB) (Jantz and Moore-Jansen: Database for forensic anthropology in the United States 1962-1991, Ann Arbor, MI: Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research, 2000) (n = 1,831), yielding 87% of correct classification for sex. Then, a simulation extracted 5,000 different random samples of 206 complete cases each from the FDB (these cases also had known sex). We then artificially imposed patterns of missing data similar to that observed in a poorly preserved bioarchaeological sample from Medieval Asturias, Spain (n = 206), and ran LPA on each sample. This tested the efficacy of LPA under extreme conditions of poor preservation (missing data, 42%). The simulation yielded an average of 82% accuracy, indicating that LPA is robust to large amounts of missing data when analyzing incomplete skeletons. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In this two-part paper (Background and Initial Assumptions (Part 1) and Results of Survey Research (Part 2)), we present surveys whose main objective is to determine, whether and to what extent the life cycle assessment (LCA) technique is used for the identification and assessment of environmental aspects in environmental management systems (EMS) and whether there are any differences in this respect between the companies and countries analysed.
   The survey research was carried out using the computer assisted self-administered interviewing (CASI) method among selected Polish, German and Swedish organisations which implement EMS in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14001 and/or the EMAS regulation.
   The organisations investigated, regardless of their country, are dominated by qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques of assessment and identification of environmental aspects. LCA was used sporadically, although some differences can be observed between the countries analysed.
   The environmental managers accustomed to traditional qualitative and semi-quantitative solutions, have not been given preparation to enable them to understand and adopt the different approaches such as LCA. On the other hand, representatives of the organisations investigated declared that they were ready to accept an even longer timescale for the identification and assessment processes relating to environmental aspects, which represents a potential opportunity for LCA. The more precise understanding and definition of environmental problems that are precisely defined in LCA would represent a novelty for environmental managers. In practice, environmental problems are defined in a general sense and rather ambiguously, as this level of detail is sufficient in the context of qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques commonly used for the identification and assessment of environmental aspects.

AB  - Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in diverse biological and pathological processes, including the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and cellular differentiation. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been reported as potential biomarkers for various pathologic conditions. This study investigated miR-30a, miR-195 and let-7b as potential of biomarker for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Methods and Results: Plasma samples from 18 patients with AMI and 30 healthy adults were collected. Total RNA was extracted from plasma with TRIzol LS Reagent. MiRNA levels and plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA assay, respectively. Results showed that circulating miR-30a in AMI patients was highly expressed at 4 h, 8 h and 12 h after onset of AMI, and miR-195 was highly expressed at 8 h and 12 h. However, let-7b was lower in AMI patients than in controls throughout the whole time points. Interestingly, in these patients, circulating miR-30a, miR-195 and let-7b all reached their expression peak at 8 h. By the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, these plasma miRNAs were of significant diagnostic value for AMI. The combined ROC analysis revealed the an AUC value of 0.93 with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity at 8 h after onset, and an AUC value of 0.92 with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity at 12 h after onset, in discriminating the AMI patients from healthy controls.
   Conclusions: Our results imply that the plasma concentration of miR-30a, miR-195 and let-7b can be potential indicators for AMI.

AB  - Sustainability assessments of buildings using the life cycle approach have become more and more common. This includes the assessment of the environmental performance of buildings. However, the influence of the construction products used for the fabric, the finishing, and the technical building equipment of buildings has hardly been described in literature. For this reason, we evaluated the influence of the technical building equipment and its impact on the environment for different residential buildings.
   Five residential buildings were evaluated by applying the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA) (ISO14040) expressed using quantitative assessment categories according to prEN15978.
   Results show that the optimization of energy performance has already reached a high level in Austria, so that the overall potential for possible improvements is quite low. Especially in low-energy and passive-house-standard residential buildings, the limits for energy optimization in the use phase have mostly been achieved. In contrast to this, the integrated LCA (iLCA) findings attribute a high optimization potential to the construction products used for the technical building equipment as well as to the building fabric and finishing. Additionally, the passive house shows the lowest contribution of the technical building equipment on the overall LCA results.
   The iLCA findings suggest that it is recommended to include the technical building equipment for future assessments of the environmental performance of buildings. It is also suggested to use a broad number of environmental indicators for building LCA.

AB  - The green area displayed by a crop is a good indicator of its photosynthetic capacity, while chlorophyll retention or 'stay-green' is regarded as a key indicator of stress adaptation. Remote-sensing methods were tested to estimate these parameters in diverse wheat genotypes under different growing conditions. Two wheat populations (a diverse set of 294 advanced lines and a recombinant inbred line population of 169 sister lines derived from the cross between Seri and Babax) were grown in Mexico under three environments: drought, heat, and heat combined with drought. In the two populations studied here, a moderate heritable expression of stay-green was found-when the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at physiological maturity was estimated using the regression of NDVI over time from the mid-stages of grain-filling to physiological maturity-and for the rate of senescence during the same period. Under heat and heat combined with drought environments, stay-green calculated as NDVI at physiological maturity and the rate of senescence, showed positive and negative correlations with yield, respectively. Moreover, stay-green calculated as an estimation of NDVI at physiological maturity and the rate of senescence regressed on degree days give an independent measurement of stay-green without the confounding effect of phenology. On average, in both populations under heat and heat combined with drought environments CTgf and stay-green variables accounted for around 30% of yield variability in multiple regression analysis. It is concluded that stay-green traits may provide cumulative effects, together with other traits, to improve adaptation under stress further.

AB  - The Greater Rhea (Rhea americana) is a near-threatened species. Wild populations are affected by human activities, such as illegal hunting, egg harvesting and conversion of natural habitats to croplands. An indicator of disturbance:; is the increase of the glucocorticoid corticosterone, a;tress hormone that helps to cope with life-threatening situations. Here, we evaluate and characterize adrenocortical function in the Greater Rhea by validating the use of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) to assess fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations, and by comparing the time course of plasma corticosterone and fecal immunoreactive glucocorticoid metabolite excretion. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge was performed and serial blood and fecal (cecal and rectal) samples were collected and analyzed by a corticosterone RIA. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to characterize fecal immunoreactive glucocorticoid metabolites. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of two immunoreactive glucocorticoid metabolites in rectal and cecal Rhea feces. Greater Rheas responded to the ACTH challenge with a 30-fold increase in plasma corticosterone concentration 2 h post-injection, and a 30- to 40-fold increase in concentrations of glucocorticoid metabolites from rectal feces 4-6 h post-injection. In cecal feces, ACTH challenge produced an 11-fold increase. Therefore, collection of rectal feces would be more appropriated to ensure detection of minor increases in adrenocortical activity in this species. The adrenocortical response to ACTH found in Rhea was higher than what is usually observed in other birds and might be associated with their flightless condition and the use of running as an antipredator strategy.

AB  - Faunal surveys of western Lake Erie showed a dramatic change in the species composition and abundance of the invertebrate mud-bottom community. Abundances of formerly dominant ostracods, tubificid and naidid oligochaetes, and chironomids declined 85%, 87%, 80%, and 72%, respectively, between 1982 and 2003. The majority of the declines occurred between 1982 and 1993, when dreissenid abundances were increasing rapidly. Hexagenia nymphs became important members of the infaunal community after 1993. Faunal declines were uncorrelated to weather-related variables. The frequency and magnitude of thermal stratification with accompanying hypoxic conditions during the study period remained within the normal range of variation observed in western Lake Erie. Significant wind events and storm driven seiches that might cause benthos mortality were not correlated with the decadal patterns of faunal decline. Nor were the faunal declines associated with the historical decrease in organic loading, because most of the decrease occurred prior to the study period. Nearly all abundant species declined significantly between 1982 and 1993, but deposit-feeding fauna, eutrophic indicator species, small organisms, and nearshore mud-bottom stations adjacent to dreissenid mussel habitat were most severely affected. These patterns suggest that a systemic change in the trophic structure of western Lake Erie occurred, due mostly to the invasion of dreissenid mussels nearshore and an accompanying diversion of organic matter away from deeper offshore muds. Trophic group amensalism may operate differently in marine and freshwater habitats, although dreissenids may exert ecosystem effects in the Great Lakes similar to oysters in Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - Resolving land cover hierarchy relationships in urban settings is important for defining the scale and type of management required to enhance stream health. We investigated associations between macroinvertebrate assemblages in urban streams of Hamilton, New Zealand, and environmental variables measured at multiple spatial scales comprising (i) local-scale physicochemical conditions, (ii) impervious area in multiple stream corridor widths (30, 50 and 100 m) along segments (sections of stream between tributary nodes) and for entire upstream networks, and (iii) total impervious area in stream segment sub-catchments and upstream catchments. Imperviousness was higher for stream segment sub-catchments than for entire catchments because of the agricultural headwaters of some urban streams. Imperviousness declined as corridor width declined at both segment and catchment scales reflecting the vegetated cover along most urban stream gullies. Upstream catchment imperviousness was strongly and inversely correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentration, whereas segment and upstream corridor scales were correlated with water temperature and pH. Corridor imperviousness appeared to be a stronger predictor than catchment imperviousness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa richness and the Quantitative Urban Community Index specifically developed to assess impacts of urbanisation. In contrast, imperviousness at all measured scales added only marginal improvement in assemblage-based models over that provided by the local-scale physicochemical variables of reach width, habitat quality, macrophyte cover, pH and dissolved oxygen concentration. These findings infer variable scales of influence affecting macroinvertebrate communities in urban streams and suggest that it may be important to consider local and corridor factors when determining mechanisms of urbanisation impacts and potential management options.

AB  - Haematological parameters are indicators of the response of the animal to the environment and used as reliable indicators of fish health status to detect physiological changes following different stress conditions. This study was carried out to evaluate some haematological and biochemical parameters of Cyprinus carpio caught in Munzur River, Tunceli, Turkey. The values of total red blood cell count (RBC), haematocrit (HCT), haemoglobin concentration (HGB), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cellular haemoglobin content (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), plateletcrit (PCT), platelet distribution width (PDW) were measured. Levels of amylase, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), cholesterol (CHOL), albumin (ALB), total protein (T-PROT), direct bilirubin (D-BIL), total bilirubin (T-BIL), gamma glutamyle tranferas (GGT), urea, creatinine, glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TRIG), uric acid (Uric-A), sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and iron, chlorine were determined as 1.02 10(12)/L, 17.90 %, 11.72 g/L, 198.00 fL, 166.82 pg, 89.50 g/dL, 112.80 10(9)/L, 8.06 fL, 0.055 %, 17.59 fL, 87.20 U/L, 220.24 mg/dL, 767.40 mg/dL, 1.60 g/dL, 4.68 g/dL, 1.83 mg/dL, 3.046 mg/dL, 12.00 U/L, 9.20 mg/dL, 0.72 mg/dL. 504.40 mg/dL, 381.00 mg/dL, 2.76 mg/dL, 134.20 mmol/L, 1.90 mmol/L, 13.78 mg/dL, 17.96 mg/dL, 262.60 g/dL, 81.80 mmol/L, respectively.

AB  - Knowledge of the transport patterns of chemicals applied to soils is essential for environmental assessment of potential leaching to groundwater supplies. In this study, the mobility of imidacloprid applied to soils with different properties was investigated. The approach used was that of a modified miscible displacement, where soil columns under soil water-saturated conditions and constant flow velocity were maintained. The extent of imidacloprid mobility was measured by quantifying the concentration in the effluent solution versus time. All measured breakthrough curves (BTC) exhibited extensive asymmetry with sharp adsorption fronts. Imidacloprid exhibited high mobility in a silty kaolinitic (Mahan) soil, where 69% of the applied chemical was recovered in the effluent solution. In contrast, somewhat limited mobility was observed for Mhoon soil, with a high organic matter content (3.5%), where only 27% of applied imidacloprid was recovered. All BTC exhibited extensive tailing during leaching of the applied imidacloprid, indicative of the time-dependent release reactions of the adsorbed imidacloprid. A decrease in effluent concentration in response to flow interruption was also observed, which indicated kinetic retention of imidacloprid in all soils examined. The use of a linear model (CXTFIT) to simulate measured BTC showed good overall predictions. Concentration maxima and peak arrival time were well predicted by CXTFIT, but the slow release of imidacloprid during leaching was underestimated. The use of a multireaction and transport model proved successful in describing imidacloprid BTC for all soils. Based on measured BTC results, imidacloprid may be considered as a moderately mobile chemical that is susceptible to leaching from the soil profile.

AB  - Few studies have examined grain quality of food-grade sorghum hybrids. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of environment and hybrid on grain quality of commercially available food-grade sorghums. A randomized complete block experiment with three replications was planted in 12 environments, which included the 2004 and 2005 growing seasons and irrigated and dryland water regimes in eastern, central, and west central Nebraska and a dryland low-N environment in eastern Nebraska. Environment accounted for 5 to 140 times greater variation in measured parameters than hybrid, and the hybrid x environment interaction accounted for less than 2% of the total variation. Grain yield and kernel mass varied, with low yields of 1 4 Mg ha(-1) and kernels weighing 9.5 g 1000 kernels(-1) in the low-N 2004 environment, high grain yields of 10 5 Mg ha(-1) under irrigated conditions in central Nebraska in 2005, and kernels weighing 27 8g 1000 kernels(-1) in the eastern Nebraska dryland 2005 environment Harder grain was produced in 2005 than in 2004, with the west central and central 2005 environments having the lowest tangential abrasive dehulling device (TADD) removals of 14%. Non-food-grade hybrids produced higher grain yields and kernel mass than food-grade hybrids Grain hardness was greater for non-food-grade and medium maturity hybrids when environmental means were lower (i.e., softer) but showed little or no difference in hardness when environmental means were high. Nebraska production environments have the capability to produce high quality food-grade sorghums for specific food uses to benefit both the producer and the food processor

AB  - Ethanol is increasingly used as a means to reduce gasoline consumption. As a result, it has also attracted analysis of its economic, social, and environmental merit. In order for the ethanol production industry to continue to expand, these issues must be confronted in future development. Although technological development is often relied upon, carefully considered ethanol refinery siting also mitigates some of these concerns. Five alternative siting locations were selected in the western Canadian Prairies. These were evaluated using 12 criteria which represent regional resources, economic conditions, government support, or social indicators The criteria were weighted to represent the perspectives of two stakeholders. The Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment and Evaluations (PROMETHEE) method was applied to this data, ranking the alternative sites. Several future scenarios were created to analyze the sensitivity of the results to both statistical data and subjective inputs. The rankings proved to be robust, and varied little in the different scenarios. Southern Alberta had an advantage with a high ethanol byproduct demand, education level, and ethanol demand Southern Manitoba benefitted from the lowest labor and miscellaneous costs, due to higher unemployment. Saskatchewan suffers from low byproduct demand and a decrease in water availability while having a heated economy which increases costs. In addition, Saskatchewan as a whole is currently the leader in ethanol production, resulting in less net demand, reduced access to government incentives, and more local competition Southern Alberta and Southern Manitoba are the optimal regions for future ethanol biorefinery, where as the Saskatchewan locations are the least attractive.

AB  - Monitoring of body temperature. but also of C-reactive protein (CRP) level is performed in infected patients treated with antibiotics. These two parameters having low specificity for any diagnosis our aim was to evaluate the Usefulness of CRP in this context.
   Patients and method. - A representative sample of patients was randomly extracted from our medical computerized tables. All patients presented community-based infections and had at least two CRP level assessments. Kinetics of body temperature and CRP allowed to quantify clinical and biological discrepancy while the patient's chart was studied to determine the etiologies.
   Results. - Three hundred and ninety-two patients over 942 (42%) were admitted in our department over 2 years, including 147 cases of respiratory infections (37%), 91 of urinary infections (23%), 65 of cellulitis (17%), 70 of primary bacteremia (18%), 19 of digestive infections (5%). Ninety-four pet-cent of the patients had been prescribed antibiotic therapy. We observed a correlation between temperature and CRP in 83% of the patients. Forty-seven percent of patients presented with normalized body temperature and persistently high levels of CRP, which was most of the time related to comorbid conditions. Twenty patients (5%) presented with unexplained persistent fever despite CRP normalization. Therapeutic modifications were mostly observed in the presence of clinicobiological discrepancy: 21% versus 6%, p < 0.001.
   Discussion. - Body temperature and CRP are two parameters leading to comparable information in more than 90% of infected patients receiving specific antibiotic therapy. These clinical and biological discrepancies are associated to a modified antibiotherapy with inconclusive results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Arisaig Basin in Nova Scotia, Canada provides a regional sedimentary record of an Early Silurian basin subsidence on the microcontinent of Avalon. The lower members of the Arisaig Group (Beechill Cove and Lower Ross Brook Formations) are likely to be deposited in a basin formed during syn- to post-collisional rifting/subsidence driven by the collision of Avalon and Baltica. The evolution of this constricted basin can be tracked by examining the geochemistry of the sedimentary rocks deposited within the basin. Here we report on the chemostratigraphy of the Arisaig Group, a series of siliciclastics, with a focus on understanding the redox chemistry during sedimentation. The trace and major-element geochemistry of this group provides insight into the oceanographic and geological processes that were influencing its depositional environment. In particular, concentrations of U, V, Mo, Ni, Cd, and Pb indicate regional shifts in ocean redox state, which serve as a proxy for changes in ocean circulation and regional tectonic activity. We find evidence for anoxic conditions near the base of Ross Brook Formation, and attribute this anomaly in redox status to a significant change in physical mixing in the region. Trace element concentrations indicate that this anoxic event was associated with poor circulation rather than elevated productivity and organic matter burial. Based on these data, we confirm that these sediments are deposited in a tectonically formed basin during a period of limited ocean circulation. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, carried out from 2004 to 2006, leaf and stem water potential and stem water content were measured in Quercus pyrenaica Willd. individuals in an experimental forested catchment located in Central Western Spain under Mediterranean subhumid conditions. These indicators of tree water status were compared with soil moisture contents measured in the same area from 0 to 1 m depth and from 0 to 2.5 m depth during the last year of the study. The objectives were to clarify the seasonal and year-to-year variations in tree water status, to examine applicability of stem water content as useful water stress indicator and to discuss how deep soil water and root uptake contribute to survival during the long dry summer. Seasonal variations in the tree variables measured revealed a typical pattern, with maximum values at the end of spring followed by a progressive decline during the summer drought in response to the decrease in soil water content (almost exhausted at 0-100 cm depth). The relatively high values and the non-significant variation in predawn leaf water potentials (except for 2005, which was exceptionally dry) indicate that no clear water stress situations occurred. This may be explained in terms of a progressive absorption of water from the deeper layers. The results also suggest that the stem water content is a more sensitive indicator of long-term water limitation than the other variables measured.

AB  - Forest decline in Ethiopia is highlighted by several authors but there is no consensus on its causes and consequences. The objective of this study is to investigate, from sociopolitical and geographical perspectives, the linkage between the trend of forest decline and changes in the social, economic, and political pattern in the Awassa watershed over a 100-year. perspective. Field observations, satellite image and map analyses, interviews, and literature studies were employed, and natural indicators were analyzed. The findings indicate that the forest area declined from about 40% at the turn of the 19th century to less than 3% in the year 2000. Forest decline in the study area during the elected time period is the result of the combination of biophysical and social conditions. Important causes are geographic properties, sociopolitical changes, population growth, unstable land tenure principles, agricultural development, and the improvement of transport capacity. The main conclusions are as follows: Already in the early 20th century forest decline was in progress and forests were attributed an insignificant economic classification. Large areas of forest were cut down during periods of political transition when as a result of the political vacuum, interest in the protection of resources including forests was lacking. Long-term planning efforts to manage forests were obstructed by uncertainty resulting from land tenure principle change during each political period. The sparse area of forest land that remains is becoming increasingly attractive as potential land for arable agriculture because of improved road access between the study area and distant markets.

AB  - Distribution of submerged macrophytes was assessed at 15 littoral sites in large, shallow Lake Balaton using the echo sounding technique. Sites represented the conspicuous longitudinal and transverse environmental gradients. Absence/presence of plants, water depth, bottom consistency and distance from the shore have been derived from echo sounding data. Turbidity and meteorological variables were recorded at a single site from 2004 to 2006. Site-specific variability in underwater light conditions (an indicator of stress) and exposure to breaking waves (an indicator of disturbance) were estimated by simple models.
   Light deficiency was the prime factor that determined the distribution and colonization depth of submerged macrophytes. The influence of light and exposure on plants could be distinguished by considering the complex interplay of site-specific morphometry and the stochastic wind field in a highly simplified manner. Unlike in the wind protected northern littoral, wave disturbance limited the distribution of plants along the offshore portion of the nearly horizontal southern plateau. Due to the long (in the order of several kilometres) fetch in the direction of the dominant winds, establishment of a macrophyte dominated stable state can only be expected at a local scale in spite of the shallow mean depth of Lake Balaton.
   Relative frequency of plants was the highest at the same bottom consistency in both the muddy northern and the sandy southern littoral. Preference of submerged macrophytes towards relatively firm bottoms could be demonstrated along the northern shore. The observed pattern suggested that preference was not driven by nutrient availability. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic and pelagic communities in the central Gulf of Papua, a major deltaic clinoform located on the south coast of Papua New Guinea, reflect the spatial and seasonal patterns in physical sedimentation conditions and the availability of food resources across this system. The distribution of terrigenous and marine organic substrates, the transport of riverine-derived sediment, and seafloor dynamics are largely controlled by two seasons and wind patterns: the relatively quiescent NW Monsoon and more energetic SE Trades. The physically disturbed inner-topset deposits (<20 m) are dominated at all times by bacterial biomass and have depressed numbers of macrofauna, with evidence of periodic recolonization recorded in sedimentary structures. The inner-topset region also shows strong seasonality in the production and availability of labile organic matter and in bacterial activity. As measured by the concentrations of photopigments and microbial biomass in the upper 2 cm of surface sediments and in the water column, the comparatively quiescent NW Monsoon period is associated with net delivery of reactive substrates as labile organic matter to the bottom and net growth of the benthic microbial community, whereas the Transition period between the NW Monsoonal-Winds ( NW Monsoon) and SE Trade-Winds ( SE Trades), and the SE Trades, are periods of reactive substrate depletion in bottom deposits and decreased benthic bacterial and macroinfaunal biomass. In contrast to the inner-topset, the less physically disturbed outer-topset and foreset show relatively enhanced, but still low, abundances of large macrobenthos and possible evidence of variation related to food supply. The greatest observed seasonal variation in macrofauna occurs in the Umuda Valley off the Fly River, an apparent mobile sediment conduit.

AB  - The dose-response relationship for hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction in barramundi (Lates calcarifer) was examined under controlled laboratory conditions for 15 d using farm-reared barramundi. These results were compared with EROD activity measured in barramundi collected from two rivers catchments (impacted and nonimpacted) in northern Queensland, Australia. Barramundi were dosed by intraperitoneal injection with a known cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) inducer, beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF), at 5, 10, and 50 mg kg(-1) using two controls: A vehicle control (corn-oil injected) and an experimental control (no injection). The EROD induction occurred within 4 It in the 5, 10, and 50 mg beta-NF kg-1 exposures, reaching mean maximum activities of 88.6 (+/-51.9), 85.5 (+/-91.7), and 149.1 (+/-106.4) pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1), respectively. Mean EROD activities remained low in the corn-oil controls (2.1 +/- 1.8 pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1)) and experimental controls (5.3 +/- 4.4 pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1)) throughout the study. Barramundi demonstrated a rapid response curve, which was dose dependent (50 > 10 > 5 mg beta-NF kg(-1)) and decreased progressively over time from induction. Measurement of total cytochrome P450 content (nmol mg protein(-1)) was not dose dependent. The EROD activities from field-collected barramundi from the Johnstone River (impacted) and Olive River (nonimpacted) suggest exposure to low-level contaminants in the Johnstone River fish only. With more controlled laboratory and field studies, barramundi have the potential to become a major indicator species in assessing exposure to environmental contaminants in coastal areas throughout northern Queensland, Australia.

AB  - This study addresses the question of the relation between cellular and genomic oxidative damages in freshwater bivalves in realistic conditions of exposure in the field. Membrane and genomic oxidative damages were studied by means of lipid peroxidation and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) was used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation. The biomarkers were measured in the digestive gland and the gills of mussels (Unio tumidus) after 7 and 21 days of exposure in four ponds of the Moselle Basin, during three field studies conducted in 1999 and 2000. Effects measured at three sites (1R, 3C and 4M) were moderate and lipid peroxidation was slightly enhanced in mussels transferred in these ponds. In contrast, an important degradation was observed at site 2V reflected by a sharp increase in MDA and 8-oxodGuo concentrations in 2000. The biomarker responses agreed with the results of physicochemical analyses that indicated a worsening of water quality at the same site. Globally, a relationship was found between MDA increase and 8-oxodGuo formation, in the digestive gland after 7 days of exposure, and later in the gills (21 days). Responses of the digestive glands and gills to the oxidative parameters appeared correlated only after 21 days of exposure. The biomarkers selected confirmed their sensitivity for appraising the water quality of hydrosystems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adaptive female choice is thought to have led to the evolution of nutritionally valuable nuptial gifts in many insect species. However, in several dance fly species, males offer and females accept "empty gifts" with no nutritional value. In the species studied here, Empis snoddyi Steyskal, males produce empty balloons comprised of hundreds of silk bubbles and form mating swarms that females approach to investigate males. Males within the swarm engage in agonistic interactions. The empty balloon has been hypothesized to be an indicator of male condition such that males with larger balloons are predicted to have higher mating success and be more successful in male-male interactions than males with smaller balloons. We examined the role of male body size and balloon size in the context of intersexual and intrasexual selection. We found that neither male body size nor balloon size affected the outcome of pairwise male-male interactions. Using multiple-regression techniques, we found significant linear selection for increasing male body size and decreasing balloon size associated with mating success, a surprising result given a positive relationship between male body size and balloon size. A visualization of selection showed the highest peak of male mating success for larger males with intermediate-size balloons. These results can be explained by a trade-off between long-range attraction of females using large balloons and close-range attraction of females via improved flying efficiency associated with smaller balloons. Both male body size and balloon size are important components in determining male mating success; however, the empty balloon does not appear to play a typical role as a sexually selected ornament.

AB  - The article presents the study's results of the morphogen development features of the Shrub roses explants during in vitro reproduction - five cultivars from the collection fund of the National Dendrological Park "Sofiyivka" of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine: 'Gartnerfreude' (W. Kordes' Sohne, 1991), 'Lavender Dream' (G. P. Ilsink, 1984), 'Pomponella' (W. Kordes' Sohne, 2005), 'Red Cascade' (R. S. Moore, 1976), 'Sommerabend' (W. Kordes' Sohne, 1995). The listed cultivars belong to those Shrub roses that form a dense cover of shoots, leaves, and flowers and are applicable for decorating plots that are of little avail for growing other ornamental plants. Shrub roses of most varieties introduced into the National Dendrological Park "Sofiyivka" National Academy of Science of Ukraine have shown sufficient adaptive ability in the natural and climatic conditions of the introduction area. Studies of gas resistance have shown that roses of this class adapt well to the conditions of the high content of traffic fumes and dust while maintaining high decorative qualities, which gave reason to recommend them for wide use in landscaping settlements of the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe Zone of Ukraine. However, the experience of introducing Shrub roses into gardening has shown that to create landscape expositions, it is often necessary to have a large amount of planting material of a specific cultivar, and to solve the problem requires the use of new, promising propagation methods. One of them is the in vitro plant propagation method, developed based on biotechnology to preserve plants genetically identical to the original maternal form, which contributes to the production of morphologically aligned, genetically homogeneous planting material. Therefore, the study of the reproduction features of the garden class Shrub roses, cultivated in vitro, defined the dependence of the explants morphogen development on changes in the concentrations of cytokinins and auxins included in the nutrient media are relevant and have both scientific and practical interest. The authors revealed that the studied cultivars were successfully introduced into the culture in vitro, are capable of direct morphogenesis when using exogenous phytohormones 6-BAP, beta-IBA, beta-IAA, 1-NAA; however, they had unequal indicators in the morphogenetic reactions display the degree. It was found that the phytohormonal regulation of morphogen processes in explants was determined by the presence of specific ratios of both auxins and cytokinins in the nutrient medium. Using segments of shoots with axillary and apical buds, the authors obtained morphogen structures that were formed directly on explants by the direct morphogenesis type. Of the tested inducers of morphogenesis, the most effective for the Shrub roses was MS 6-BAP - 2.0 mg/l and beta-IBA - 0.01 mg/l to the nutrient medium. Within 28-34 days after passage on nutrient media modified with the addition of phytohormones, active formation of morphogen structures was observed, which gave rise to shoots, the number of which averaged from 2.92 to 12.04 pcs. per explant. 'Red Cascade' and 'Sommerabend' cvs differed in the maximum indices of adventive shoot formation, which, in six passages, reached a multiplication rate of 12.2 +/- 0.33 and 7.24 +/- 0.35, respectively. 'Gartnerfreude', 'Lavender Dream', 'Pomponella' cvs. under the influence of various concentrations of phytohormones had slightly lower indices of morphogen potential with the multiplication rate in the range of 3.66 +/- 0.15 to 6.33 +/- 0.11.
   Thus, the differentiation of meristemic tissues of the studied Shrub rose cultivars with the subsequent induction of morphogenesis depends on the concentration of both cytokinins and auxins in nutrient media and determines the successful reproduction of these plants in vitro. A short reproduction cycle allows for a short time to obtain the required amount of planting material while maintaining the necessary economically valuable traits.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the production patterns present in rural properties producing cattle in the micro-regions that make up the state of Para. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was applied to identify the patterns, and these data are used to evaluate correlation between the heterogeneity of rural properties and the environmental impact on the identified patterns. The theoretical contribution is based on discussions on global impacts of food production and environmental sustainability and the impacts of livestock production systems in Brazil and the Amazon. Survey data were taken from the 2017 Agricultural Census, available for the 144 municipalities in the state, and pooled into 22 micro-regions. Three patterns of rural properties were identified: the first related to conservation management practices and called transition management; the second highlights aspects associated with information technology and communication (ICT) and productivity called technical productive efficiency; the third indicates the importance of social organization and access to information called social participation. With these patterns, it was possible to develop the Traditional Performance Indicator (TPI), in which the micro-regions of Sao Felix do Xingu, Itaituba and Conceicao do Araguaia were those with the highest values of this indicator, water protection practices are present in the properties, however, in precarious conditions, and conservation practices are rarely used. The correlation between heterogeneity, measured by the size of pasture area in each micro region, and the TPI is positive, strong and significant. In this transition context, public policies are essential to provide access to infrastructure, credit and good animal health and biotechnology practices.

AB  - Mental state changes induced by stimuli under experimental settings or by daily events in real life affect task performance and are entwined with physical and mental health. In this study, we developed a physiological state indicator with five parameters that reflect the subject's real-time physiological states based on online EEG signal processing. These five parameters are attention, fatigue, stress, and the brain activity shifts of the left and right hemispheres. We designed a target detection experiment modified by a cognitive attention network test for validating the effectiveness of the proposed indicator, as such conditions would better approximate a real chaotic environment. Results demonstrated that attention levels while performing the target detection task were significantly higher than during rest periods, but also exhibited a decay over time. In contrast, the fatigue level increased gradually and plateaued by the third rest period. Similar to attention levels, the stress level decreased as the experiment proceeded. These parameters are therefore shown to be highly correlated to different stages of the experiment, suggesting their usage as primary factors in passive brain-computer interfaces (BCI). In addition, the left and right brain activity indexes reveal the EEG neural modulations of the corresponding hemispheres, which set a feasible reference of activation for an active BCI control system, such as one executing motor imagery tasks. The proposed indicator is applicable to potential passive and active BCI applications for monitoring the subject's physiological state change in real-time, along with providing a means of evaluating the associated signal quality to enhance the BCI performance.

AB  - There are increasing number of abandoned mines, which has gradually become a striking challenge for sustainable development and resource recycling. Safety risks and environmental pressures have obliged the mining industry to achieve the secondary development of mines. This paper builds a conceptual framework for abandoned mine resource utilization, and then denotes the 5 R principles (remining, recovery, redevelopment, reutilization, and recycling) and the energy-based, resource-based and function-based development patterns for scientific resource deployment with abandoned mines. Decision factors are investigated from four types of reutilization modes with 43 indicators, which can be classified as economy, resource potential, geography and safety. An integrated analytic hierarchy process (ANP) and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) model are employed to explore the suitable reutilization methods for abandoned mines. The results from the case study show that suitable temperature conditions and technical problems are the top two decisive factors with weights of 0.3178 and 0.1604 respectively. The best strategy for a stone pit is to develop the service industry, which is valued at 20.99% in the seven strategies. The findings of this research indicate the urgent task of abandoned mine database construction and the significance of social performance management for mine closure. Implications are advanced for sustainable management and abandoned mine resource conservation, which help to implement low-carbon transition in the mining sector from the life cycle and cradle-to-cradle perspectives while achieving socioeconomic development and the transformation of resource-based cities.

AB  - Background: This research investigated and identified significant spatial clusters of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related emergency department (ED) visits and in-patient (IP) hospitalizations, and social determinants of health in Sangamon County, IL. Sangamon County falls in the worst quartile of Illinois counties for age-adjusted asthma ED visits from years 2016 to 2018 (40.69/10,000 adults) and hospitalization rates from years 2009 to 2011 (14.4/10,000 adults). Age-adjusted COPD ED visits were 28.3/10,000 adults compared with 17.7/10,000 adults in Illinois. Age-adjusted COPD IP visits from years 2009 to 2011 were 21.1/10,000.
   Methods: Patients within the Sangamon County, Illinois geographic boundary were mapped according to diagnosis for a total of 385 unique patients with a 99% match rate. 2014 U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) data provided key sociodemographic variables associated with disadvantaged communities and health disparities, including education level and employment.
   Results: Overall, low median income, lower median year of housing structure, and percent health insurance emerged as key spatial indicators of COPD IP/ED and asthma ED visits. Significant clustering between health outcomes and these variables deviates from current large urban-based research literature on asthma and COPD.
   Discussion: Analysis of other types of socioeconomic, housing, and health insurance variables revealed that significant spatial components were nonexistent in rural areas. Rural social determinants of health indicators are markedly different from current respiratory disease literature.
   Conclusion: Further studies are needed, which are particularly important for those with chronic respiratory conditions who live in older homes.

AB  - The excessive accumulation of organicmatter (OM) in sediments in aquaculture ponds is a potential environmental threat due to the risk of endogenous water pollution and eutrophication. From the perspective of inhibiting OM accumulation to prevent endogenous water pollution, the present study investigated the OM degradation states, variations of bacterial communities and basic environmental factors in sediments with/without Macrobrachium nipponense treatment/control groups in triplicate for effects of bioturbation on OM degradation in 90-day incubation. The total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the M. nipponense treatment were higher than in the control at the 30th and 60th days, while no significant differences between treatment and control were found at the end of the experiment. Significantly higher oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and more extensively degraded OM were observed in the M. nipponense treatment. Eleven significantly differential bacterial taxa were enriched in the sediments of M. nipponense treatment, of which eight (Actinobacteria, Chitinophagales, Chitinophagaceae, Flavihumibacter, Marinilabiliaceae, Cytophaga xylanolytica group, Christensenellaceae, and Christensenellaceae R-7 group) were significantly correlated with at least two OM degradation indicators. The functional groups chemoheterotrophy, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, xylanolysis, ureolysis, and intracellular parasiteswere enhanced by M. nipponense and were negatively correlated with OM degradation indictors. Overall, the M. nipponense bioturbation effectively increased the ORP to provide better conditions for OM degradation, altered the taxonomic composition and functional groups to enhance the bacterial ability for OM degradation, and finally promoted the OM degradation of the surface sediment in an artificial aquaculture system.

AB  - In order to increase the knowledge about crop tolerance to air pollutants in the different agroclimatic zones of the world, so that they can be efficiently considered for improving peri-urban agriculture, increasing the success of restoration projects, or enhancing air quality in polluted sites, the suitability of four economical valuable tree crops of the Mediterranean agriculture were studied under field conditions: date palm tree (Phoenix dactylifera L.), pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), fig tree (Ficus carica L.), and olive tree (Olea europaea L.). The measurement of biochemical markers such as ascorbic acid content, leaf relative water content, leaf total chlorophyll and leaf extract pH, at two contrasted air quality sites, a polluted site located around Gabes (Tunisia) industrial area and a control site, allowed the assessment of the air pollution tolerance index (APTI) and anticipated performance index (API) for the assayed species. Results showed obvious differences between the evergreen and the caducifolious tree crops assayed. Phoenix dactylifera tree (API = 6) was classified as an excellent performer for growing under poor air quality, followed by Olea europaea tree (API = 2) which was classified as a moderate performer. Both of trees can be recommended for successful results in peri-urban agriculture and restoration projects of polluted areas in the Mediterranean climate; on the contrary, the suitability of the Punica granatum (API = 1) was very poor, but still potentially interesting as a biological indicator of air pollution. Regarding the Ficus carica tree (API = 0), this species is not suitable for growing in air-polluted areas.

AB  - Lifestyle changes are key factors of the climate mitigation challenge because they drive the demand for energy, goods and food. They have received growing attention in the development and assessment of mitigation pathways, one of the key approaches used to inform mitigation policies. This paper contributes to this emerging literature by examining the political and scientific implications of integrating lifestyle changes into mitigation pathways. We analyse a large sample of pathways, supplemented by interviews with practitioners, to provide a perspective relevant to both scenario production practices themselves and the science-policy process in which they are included. We use three illustrative pathways to describe what it means to explore lifestyle changes and how this exploration can be conducted (indicators, dimensions, precision). We summarize the observed benefits of the explorations of lifestyle changes in scenario production by considering three main contributions of scenarios to policy decision-making: explicit knowledge, mediation tools and framing power. We also discuss why the integration of lifestyle changes poses a potential challenge to the robustness and reliability of pathway production methodologies, which is a condition for their policy-relevance. We therefore argue that the implications of this integration need to be carefully characterized in order to maximize the policy relevance of the analysis without compromising the robustness of the scenario development and assessment process. The nature of lifestyles, which reflect values and preferences and require a multidisciplinary approach, raises significant policy neutrality challenges and scientific challenges. Overcoming these challenges can lead to more policy-relevant pathways: we describe existing approaches in the literature and analyse their contributions and limitations.

AB  - Reversion of agricultural land to heathland and acid grassland is a priority for the conservation of these rare habitats. Restoration processes require interventions to reverse the effects of fertilization and acidity amelioration undertaken during decades of agricultural production. Belowground assessments of restoration success are few, and we have examined the utility of soil indices as a rationalized tool for land managers and restoration practitioners to assess the efficacy of restoration practice. To achieve this, we assessed a large number of variables, many of which might be near redundant, that could be optimized for such indices. We used a 14-year field experiment contrasting acidified pasture (treated with elemental sulphur), control (untreated) pasture, and adjacent native heathland and acid grassland sites. Based on biotic and abiotic parameters, several 'heathland restoration indices' (resembling soil quality indices) were generated using a minimum dataset identified through principal component analysis and a linear scoring system. For comparison we also conducted alternative analyses of all parameters, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots and analyses of similarity (ANOSIM). Use of heathland restoration indices showed that elemental sulphur application had changed the soil chemical conditions, along with the vegetation assemblage, to be comparable to that of native acid grassland, but not the belowground biology. ANOSIM on full datasets confirmed this finding. An index based on key variables, rather than an analysis of all biotic and abiotic parameters, can be valuable to land managers and stakeholders in acid grassland and heathland restoration.

AB  - This is the first study to quantify the dependence on wind velocity of airborne bacterial emission fluxes from soil. It demonstrates that manure bacteria get aerosolized from fertilized soil more easily than soil bacteria, and it applies bacterial genomic sequencing for the first time to trace environmental faecal contamination back to its source in the chicken barn. We report quantitative, airborne emission fluxes of bacteria during and following the fertilization of agricultural soil with manure from broiler chickens. During the fertilization process, the concentration of airborne bacteria culturable on blood agar medium increased more than 600 000-fold, and 1 m(3)of air carried 2.9 x 10(5)viable enterococci, i.e. indicators of faecal contamination which had been undetectable in background air samples. Trajectory modelling suggested that atmospheric residence times and dispersion pathways were dependent on the time of day at which fertilization was performed. Measurements in a wind tunnel indicated that airborne bacterial emission fluxes from freshly fertilized soil under local climatic conditions on average were 100-fold higher than a previous estimate of average emissions from land. Faecal bacteria collected from soil and dust up to seven weeks after fertilization could be traced to their origins in the poultry barn by genomic sequencing. Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences from manure, soil and dust showed that manure bacteria got aerosolized preferably, likely due to their attachment to low-density manure particles. Our data show that fertilization with manure may cause substantial increases of bacterial emissions from agricultural land. After mechanical incorporation of manure into soil, however, the associated risk of airborne infection is low.

AB  - N-acetylneuraminic acid (5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid), which is the principal sialic acid family member of the non-2-ulosonic acids and their various derivatives, is often found at the terminal position on the glycan chains that adorn all vertebrate cells. This terminal position combined with subtle variations in structure and linkage to the underlying glycan chains between humans and other mammals points to the importance of this diverse group of nine-carbon sugars as indicators of the unique aspects of human evolution and is relevant to understanding an array of human conditions. Enzymes that catalyze the removal N-acetylneuraminic acid from glycoconjugates are called neuraminidases. However, despite their documented role in numerous diseases, due to the promiscuous activity of many neuraminidases, our knowledge of the functions and metabolism of many sialic acids and the effect of the attachment to cellular glycans is limited. To this end, through a concerted effort of generation of random and site-directed mutagenesis libraries, subsequent screens and positive and negative evolutionary selection protocols, we succeeded in identifying three enzyme variants of the neuraminidase from the soil bacterium Micromonospora viridifaciens with markedly altered specificity for the hydrolysis of natural Kdn (3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-non-2-ulosonic acid) glycosidic linkages compared to those of N-acetylneuraminic acid. These variants catalyze the hydrolysis of Kdn-containing disaccharides with catalytic efficiencies (second-order rate constants: k(cat)/K-m) of greater than 10(5) M-1 s(-1); the best variant displayed an efficiency of >10(6) M-1 s(-1) at its optimal pH.

AB  - The red oak (Quercus rubra L.) is a woody plant brought to Europe from North America for its decorative value and high tolerance to frost and pollution. The species has been planted for the reclamation of brownfield sites, and introduced to commercial forests to enrich local biodiversity. Although in Poland its presence was associated with depauperation of local flora, its invasive status is still under discussion. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of red oak stands on Acari communities (Oribatida, Mesostigmata, Astigmata, Prostigmata). In the detailed analyses we focused on the Oribatida species, one of the best bioindicators of soil condition. The presence of the red oak was compared to the pedunculate (native) oak, also planted on poor acid soils. The research design included oak stands introduced in commercial forests, divided into two groups: young and old. A total number of 240 soil samples were collected, and 173 species of oribatid mites were identified. A low proportion of the Oribatida species typical for the Palearctic region, specific to deciduous forests, with sexual reproduction and belonging to the trophic level of secondary decomposers, significantly distinguished the old alien oaks from old native oaks. The results presented in this work are one of the few which concern the reaction of soil oribatid mite community to plant invasions, and provide evidence of the harmful impact of these alien tree species, which can be overlooked in short-term studies.

AB  - Composting is an advantageous method for recycling organic waste and produces organic fertilizer. Composting involves many types of microorganisms that construct complex microbial ecosystems. No previous research has attempted to determine which microorganisms commonly appear in successful (i.e. well-stabilized) composting. To producewell-stabilized compost within a short time period, accelerating organic matter decomposition during primary fermentation of composting is helpful. In this study, microbial succession during primary fermentation of composting was examined with changes in its physicochemical parameters, to identifymicroorganisms common in the final stage of primary fermentation in successful compostingwith thorough degradation of organicmatter. Composting of model food wastes (mixture of commercial rabbit food and cooked rice) was conducted by inoculating organic acid-degrading mesophilic yeast and maintaining the composting temperature at 40 degrees C for different time periods as compostwarmed, and finally maintaining it at a thermophilic temperature of 60 degrees C. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed clear correlations among measured parameters of pH, temperature, CO2 evolution rate, cell density of thermophilic bacteria, and microbial consortium. Moreover, high-throughput DNA analysis of compost bacteria revealed that Bacillales were dominant throughout the composting process; however, types of bacteria belonging to the order Bacillales group changed significantly as the degradation of organic matter progressed. In addition, the number of a certain group of Bacillales increased together with Symbiobacterium, a commensal bacterium, and these increased in the final stage of composting when organic matter was thoroughly degraded, irrespective of composting conditions. This finding would be useful in identifying an indicator microorganism for well-stabilized compost. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, were collected from three fishery stocks in the United States (U.S.) during 2009-2013 to describe spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis included rapid, synchronous transitions during autumn from mitotic spermatogonia to meiotic spermatocytes, then to haploid spermatids, and the release of spermatozoa into lobule lumen. As these transitions occurred several months prior to the spring spawning season, maturity of the testes are a poor indicator of spawning season, however, individuals can be readily evaluated prior to the spawning season for evidence of skipped spawning. Throughout this process, the gonad weight increased dramatically, with spawning-season maxima from 11 to 17% relative to individual somatic weight, suggesting considerable reproductive investment relative to other flatfishes. Fish condition also cycled seasonally, which indicated that males follow a capital breeding pattern that has been reported for female winter flounder. The timing of spermiogenesis was very similar in the fish among each U.S. stock (Southern New England [SNE], Georges Bank [GB], and the Gulf of Maine [GOM]) and published data from coastal Newfoundland, even though U.S. winter flounder spawned earlier in spring than fish in the Canadian stock. Male maturity varied in relation to both size and age, and over time, in patterns similar to those reported for female winter flounder, but at smaller and younger sizes than females. These intra-specific variations in reproductive seasonality, maturation, and skipped spawning suggest that winter flounder have the potential to adaptively respond to a dynamic environment in a region where ocean warming is occurring rapidly.

AB  - European landscape conservation includes the recognition of inter-related 'ancient' and 'old-growth' woodland. Ancient woodland is defined by its temporal continuity, which can be measured through its consistent occurrence on historic maps over a period of time, typically several centuries. Old-growth woodland has attributes of both temporal continuity and structural complexity; European old-growth woodland is now extremely rare and a valuable conservation resource. Indicator species provide recognition of old-growth woodland, through traits that are sensitive to its defining features: (i) dispersal limitation demanding temporal continuity of suitable habitat prior to colonisation (as is associated with ancient woodland), and/or (ii) specialist niches associated with old and senescent trees (which may or may not be found in ancient woodland, depending on its past management). To test the response of indicators to each of these features, niche models were developed for lichen epiphytes in an ancient and structurally diverse woodland stand, thus corresponding to 'old-growth' condition. Models were projected for the ancient and an adjacent regenerated stand. There was less suitable habitat in the regenerated stand, and a lower proportion of suitable habitat was occupied. Nevertheless, indicators had colonised from the ancient to the regenerated stand within 50 years. Viewed against the background of previous work, we conclude that landscape context the spatial relationship between ancient and regenerated woodland is critical to the interpretation of indicators, which are perhaps better conceptualised as markers of threat and conservation value than independent measures of woodland history.

AB  - From July 6th to August 5th of 2014, a severe heatwave happened in Iran. This study analysis the formation and relative effect of this heatwave event on the environmental situation in the Karaj city (west of Iran capital). This city has experienced warm summers and high amounts of heat-related mortality. This research is accomplished according to the statistical-synoptic-approach and mobile survey data. Two main data sets are collected during this event from 20 stations in the urban and rural areas. The results of data are derived from hierarchical cluster analysis by using Ward's method. Analysis of mid-level synoptic charts demonstrate a low pressure at ground level in North West of India (Gange's thermal low pressure) which covers the case study area together with a high-pressure system that dominates in the middle levels. This phenomenon affects the thickness of the atmosphere and causes warm air subsidence, abnormal air heating and a stable urban heat island (UHI) in the region. Compared to the rural areas, the temperature of the city is about 1 degrees C warmer within the day times and up to 2.5 degrees C warmer at nights. Furthermore in comparison with the rural areas, in urban environment the temperature value combination of surrounding humidity stations, determined systematically warmer status. This intensity of UHI is the simplest and most quantitative indicator of the thermal modification imposed by the Karaj city upon its territory, and shows its relative warming compared to the surrounding rural environment at night times.

AB  - Vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) is used to decontaminate clinical, biocontainment, and research animal rooms and equipment. To assist with its implementation in a murine facility, we developed a safe and effective method of VHP sterilization of IVC racks and air handling units (AHU). Safety of VHP decontamination was assessed by ensuring VHP levels dissipated to less than 1 ppm in the room prior to personnel reentry and inside the primary enclosure prior to the return of mice; this condition occurred at least 18 h after the VHP cycle. Efficacy of VHP sterilization was assessed by using chemical indicators, biologic indicators, and PCR testing for Staphylococcus xylosus, a commensal organism of murine skin and an opportunistic pathogen, which was present in 160 of 172 (93%) of specimens from occupied IVC racks and the interior surfaces of in-use AHU. Neither mechanized washing nor hand-sanitizing eradicated S. xylosus from equipment airway interiors, with 17% to 24% of specimens remaining PCR-positive for S. xylosus. 'Static-open' VHP exposure of sanitized equipment did not ensure its sterilization. In contrast, 'active-closed' VHP exposure, in which IVC racks were assembled, sealed, and connected to AHU set to the VHP cycle, increased the proportion of chemical indicators that detected sterilizing levels of VHP inside the assembled equipment, and significantly decreased PCR-detectable S. xylosus inside the equipment. Supplementing bulk steam sterilization of the primary enclosure with VHP sterilization of the secondary housing equipment during room change-outs may help to mitigate opportunistic agents that jeopardize studies involving immunodeficient strains.

AB  - Buried archaeological structures, such as earthworks and buildings, often leave traces at the surface by altering the properties of overlying material, such as soil and vegetation. These traces may be better visible from a remote perspective than on the surface. Active and passive airborne and spaceborne sensors acquiring imagery from the ultraviolet to infrared have been shown to reveal these archaeological residues following the application of various processing techniques. While the active microwave region of the spectrum, in the form of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used for archaeological prospection, particularly in desert regions, it has yet to be fully exploited to detect buried structures indirectly though proxy indicators in overlying materials in vegetated areas. Studies so far have tended to focus on the intensity of the SAR signal, without making full use of the phase. This paper demonstrates that SAR backscatter intensity, coherence and interferometry can be used to identify archaeological residues over a number of areas in the vicinity of Rome, Italy. SAR imagery from the COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) have been obtained for the analysis: 77 scenes in Stripmap and 27 in Spotlight mode. Processing included multitemporal speckle filtering, coherence generation and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) creation from Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS). Comparison of these datasets with archaeological, geological, soil, vegetation and meteorological data reveal that several products derived from SAR data can expose various types of archaeological residues under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Thirty waterbodies on the Transmexican Volcanic Belt were studied using standardized methods, covering an altitudinal gradient from 737 to 4283 masl and different climatic types. Waterbodies of tree different origins were included: tectonic (4), volcanic (11 craters or maars and 7 volcanic dams) and reservoirs (8). Reservoirs and tectonic lakes were mostly shallow (< 6 m) while volcanic lakes were the deepest (> 25 m). Most were freshwater bodies with alkaline waters (pH > 7.5) dominated by [Ca2+] or [Na+] and [HCO3-]. Subsaline (6) and hyposaline (2) lakes were dominated by [Cl-] - [HCO3-] and [Na+]. In thirteen lakes, nutrient levels could be limiting primary productivity, mostly P, but also N and Si. Half of the lakes (16) were eutrophic or hypertrophic and most of these were also shallow (< 8 m) and correlated with warm, moist conditions. Ninety-seven taxa of aquatic organisms (phytoplankton, and surface sediment diatoms, testate amoebae, cladoceran and ostracodes) were reported, which could potentially be used as bioindicators. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that temperature and precipitation were the main environmental gradients related to the lakes' limnological characteristics: colder climates related with lowest TDS (< 100 mg/L); dry climates with subsaline and hyposaline lakes, and warm-moist climates with eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. Through the Procrustes technique we obtained indications that general geographic variables were important for some of the lakes, whereas the local factors were significant for others. It is through the knowledge of the basic limnology and biodiversity of Mexican lakes that more complex or detailed studies can be proposed leading to a better understanding, management, and conservation of water resources.

AB  - Bracken ferns (Pteridium spp.) are well-known for their carcinogenic properties, which are ascribed to the content of ptaquiloside and ptaquiloside-like substances. Ptaquiloside leach from the ferns and may cause contamination of drinking water. Pterosin B is formed by hydrolysis of ptaquiloside. In soil, Pterosin B is adsorbed more strongly and it is expected to have a slower turnover than ptaquiloside. We thus hypothesized that pterosin B may serve as an indicator for any past presence of ptaquiloside. Pterosin B degradation was studied in acid forest soils from bracken-covered and bracken-free areas. Soil samples were incubated with pterosin B at 3 and 8 mu g g(-1) for 10 days, whereas sterile (autoclaved) samples were incubated for 23 days. Pterosin B showed unexpected fast degradation in soils with full degradation in topsoils in 2-5 days. Pterosin B dissipation followed the sum of two-first order reactions. The initial fast reaction with half-lives of 0.7-3.5 h contributed 11-59% of the total pterosin B degradation, while the slow reaction was 20-100 times slower than the fast reaction. Total dissipation half-lives were shorter for loamy sand (4 h) than for sandy loam soils (28 h). No degradation of pterosin B took place under sterile conditions assuming observed dissipation during the first 3 h could be attributed to irreversible sorption. Our results demonstrate that pterosin B is microbially degraded and that pterosin B is as unstable as ptaquiloside and hence cannot be used as an indicator for former presence of ptaquiloside in soil.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetes and hypertension are highly prevalent conditions in Portugal. Little is known about the geographical and social patterning of these diseases, which precludes the design of targeted health policies. This study aimed to measure the geographical and socioeconomic distribution of type 2 diabetes and hypertension prevalence in the population resident in the Northern region of Portugal, for the year 2013.
   Material and Methods: An ecological correlation study analyzed the 2,028 parishes of the region. Prevalence data were obtained from the Regional Health Administration information system. Socioeconomic data were also obtained from this administrative database and from the 2011 national census. The association between each socioeconomic indicator and age-standardized prevalence was measured using the difference in prevalence, population attributable risk, relative inequality index, and regression coefficient.
   Results: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension was 6.16% and 19.35%, respectively, and varied across parishes. These prevalences were significantly associated with low educational level, low tertiary sector weight, unemployment, and low-income rate (with prevalence differences between the most and least advantaged deciles up to 1.3% and 5.3%, respectively). Socioeconomic factors accounted for up to 20% of prevalence.
   Discussion: This study design did not allow us to evaluate causality and it may underestimate these diseases prevalence or its association with socioeconomic factors, but its results are in line with the evidence from other countries.
   Conclusion: These results emphasize the socioeconomic and geographical patterning of major diseases associated with a high mortality, and the need of health policies targeting the most deprived parishes.

AB  - Based on the widespread distribution and abundant phytoliths produced by Phragmites communis, phytoliths of P. communis in northeast China were investigated to identify the primary influencing factors on phytolith size using an orthogonal experimental method. Temperature and precipitation were found to be the prominent factors influencing the sizes of short-cell phytoliths including the saddle and the rondel morphotypes, whereas there were no obvious variations in the width-to-length ratios of short-cell phytoliths in response to environmental factors. These results indicate that short-cell phytoliths are genetically stable, confirming that they can be used for the classification of grasses. Moreover, precipitation was the main factor influencing the sizes of the lanceolate phytoliths and silicified stomata, and their width-to-length ratios changed significantly in response to precipitation and habitat differences. These findings reveal that lanceolate and silicified stomata phytoliths are sensitive to environmental changes, indicating their usefulness for palaeoenvironment reconstruction. Moreover, variations in their width-to-length ratios and their sizes may provide some information for plant classification, even at species level. Finally, the results of a principal component analysis of the sizes of P. communis phytoliths further verify the reliability of the orthogonal experiment results, in that temperature and precipitation were the prominent factors influencing the size of all P. communis phytoliths except for the length of saddle and width of the saddle morphotypes. This research into the primary environmental significance of the sizes of P. communis phytoliths may contribute to improving the precision of plant classification and the model for quantitative reconstruction of the palaeoenvironment to aid in reconstructions of palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate.

AB  - China is home to nearly half of the world's 50,000 large dams, which provide irrigation, flood protection, and hydroelectricity. Most of these projects involve substantial population displacement, which can disrupt social capital, the webs of interdependence and support that community members maintain with one another through relationships of trust and reciprocity. We use new empirical evidence to examine the association between dam-induced displacement and social capital in China and interpret our findings in the context of social-ecological resilience theory. Our focus is on agricultural households on the Upper Mekong River, where four large hydropower dams have been constructed over the past twenty years.
   Our broad finding is that resettlement is associated with diminished social capital, as measured by two key indicators: inter-household exchange of financial resources, and inter-household exchange of agricultural labor. These effects differ across the four dam sites in the study based on local economic conditions and changes in resettlement policy. We find that population resettlement is associated with markedly lower levels of agricultural labor exchange. In an economically under-developed setting, this reduces the depth and breadth of social support that agricultural households rely on to produce crops for subsistence and income. This in turn diminishes social-ecological resilience because social capital is a key factor that helps agricultural or resource-dependent communities manage risk and adapt to changes and stressors.
   We consider the policy implications of our findings in the context of scientific and industry efforts to minimize social harm, promote economic vitality, and improve the sustainability of hydropower as a form of renewable energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cerrado is a biome whose evolution is intimately influenced by constant fire events. Although many species are capable of dealing with this predictable impact, many others may be negatively affected, resulting in community changes after fire. Using ants as bioindicators of changes in biodiversity and environmental conditions, this study evaluated the effects of fire in two Cerrado vegetation types: "cerrado" sensu stricto, a xeric savanna, and wetland "veredas", a mesic vegetation on floodable soils, where water concentrates and ultimately flows towards rivers. We examined the effects of fire on both habitats in two independent sites, but with special consideration to the wetlands, which are not fully adapted to fire. Ant sampling was conducted twice before and twice after a fire event, using 288 baits and 416 pitfall traps (soil and arboreal), and 16 hand collections along three random replicate transects per area. Ant species richness and abundance were resilient to fire, and exhibited a remarkably consistent seasonal variation at unburned and burned sites. On the other hand, the fire markedly changed the ant species composition. In the wetlands, the fire spread underground due to the high concentration of peat. The impact on ant assemblages was substantial and visually perceptible for some species like Camponotus rufipes, which suffered a considerable reduction in the number of individuals after fire in this habitat. In the cerrado, a similar result was observed for Crematogaster nr. obscurata, which disappeared after fire. The wetland vegetation having little adaptation to fire, plus low resilience in the ant community resulted in a severely changed fauna, both in guild predominance and species composition, and return to an original state is uncertain.

AB  - Introduction: NeuroAiD (MLC601, MLC901), a combination of natural products, has been shown to be safe and to aid neurological recovery after brain injuries. The NeuroAiD Safe Treatment (NeST) Registry aims to assess its use and safety in the real-world setting.
   Methods and analysis: The NeST Registry is designed as a product registry that would provide information on the use and safety of NeuroAiD in clinical practice. An online NeST Registry was set up to allow easy entry and retrieval of essential information including demographics, medical conditions, clinical assessments of neurological, functional and cognitive state, compliance, concomitant medications, and side effects, if any, among patients on NeuroAiD. Patients who are taking or have been prescribed NeuroAiD may be included. Participation is voluntary. Data collected are similar to information obtained during standard care and are prospectively entered by the participating physicians at baseline (before initialisation of NeuroAiD) and during subsequent visits. The primary outcome assessed is safety (ie, non-serious and serious adverse event), while compliance and neurological status over time are secondary outcomes. The in-person follow-up assessments are timed with clinical appointments. Anonymised data will be extracted and collectively analysed. Initial target sample size for the registry is 2000. Analysis will be performed after every 500 participants entered with completed follow-up information.
   Ethics and dissemination: Doctors who prescribe NeuroAiD will be introduced to the registry by local partners. The central coordinator of the registry will discuss the protocol and requirements for implementation with doctors who show interest. Currently, the registry has been approved by the Ethics Committees of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (Malaysia) and National Brain Center (Indonesia). In addition, for other countries, Ethics Committee approval will be obtained in accordance with local requirements.

AB  - A table tuff interlayer at the bottom of Chang-7 Member of Yanchang Formation, the Ordos Basin, may serve as an indicator for stratigraphic division and correlation. In this study, zircon SHRIMP U-Pb dating was performed on the tuff at the bottom of Chang-7 Member using samples from wells Luo-36 and Zhuang-211 in the southwest of the basin, which yielded weighted average Pb-206/U-238 ages of 241.3 +/- 2.4 and 239.7 +/- 1.7 Ma, respectively. The cathodoluminescence images and the U/Th element ratio of tuff indicate that the zircons are magmatogenic and their ages represent that of the sedimentation age of the tuff at the bottom of Chang-7, which is 239.7-241.3 Ma in age. This finding confirms presence of the Middle Triassic strata at the bottom of Yanchang Formation. Taking previous findings into account, we suggest restricing the Late Triassic Yanchang Formation sensu stricto to the interval from Chang-7 to Chang-1 and assigning the interval from Chang-10 to Chang-8 as the Tongchuan Formation. The tuff at the bottom of the Chang-7 Member of Yanchang Formation represents the sedimentary response to the Qinling orogenic event in the early Indosinian. This tectonic event resulted in major changes in paleogeomorphology and the sedimentary environment of the lake basin during deposition of the Yanchang Formation. During this period, extremely favourable conditions were present for subsequent hydrocarbon generation and pooling of lake basin.

AB  - Microorganisms play several important roles in unconventional gas recovery, from biodegradation of hydrocarbons to souring of wells and corrosion of equipment. During and after the hydraulic fracturing process, microorganisms are subjected to harsh physicochemical conditions within the kilometer-deep hydrocarbon-bearing shale, including high pressures, elevated temperatures, exposure to chemical additives and biocides, and brine-level salinities. A portion of the injected fluid returns to the surface and may be reused in other fracturing operations, a process that can enrich for certain taxa. This study tracked microbial community dynamics using pyrotag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in water samples from three hydraulically fractured Marcellus shale wells in Pennsylvania, USA over a 328-day period. There was a reduction in microbial richness and diversity after fracturing, with the lowest diversity at 49 days. Thirty-one taxa dominated injected, flowback, and produced water communities, which took on distinct signatures as injected carbon and electron acceptors were attenuated within the shale. The majority (>90%) of the community in flowback and produced fluids was related to halotolerant bacteria associated with fermentation, hydrocarbon oxidation, and sulfur-cycling metabolisms, including heterotrophic genera Halolactibacillus, Vibrio, Marinobacter, Halanaerobium, and Halomonas, and autotrophs belonging to Arcobacter. Sequences related to halotolerant methanogenic genera Methanohalophilus and Methanolobus were detected at low abundance (<2%) in produced waters several months after hydraulic fracturing. Five taxa were strong indicators of later produced fluids. These results provide insight into the temporal trajectory of subsurface microbial communities after "fracking" and have important implications for the enrichment of microbes potentially detrimental to well infrastructure and natural gas fouling during this process.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence is a non-invasive measurement of photosystem II (PSII) activity and is a commonly used technique in plant physiology. The sensitivity of PSII activity to abiotic and biotic factors has made this a key technique not only for understanding the photosynthetic mechanisms but also as a broader indicator of how plants respond to environmental change. This, along with low cost and ease of collecting data, has resulted in the appearance of a large array of instrument types for measurement and calculated parameters which can be bewildering for the new user. Moreover, its accessibility can lead to misuse and misinterpretation when the underlying photosynthetic processes are not fully appreciated. This review is timely because it sits at a point of renewed interest in chlorophyll fluorescence where fast measurements of photosynthetic performance are now required for crop improvement purposes. Here we help the researcher make choices in terms of protocols using the equipment and expertise available, especially for field measurements. We start with a basic overview of the principles of fluorescence analysis and provide advice on best practice for taking pulse amplitude-modulated measurements. We also discuss a number of emerging techniques for contemporary crop and ecology research, where we see continual development and application of analytical techniques to meet the new challenges that have arisen in recent years. We end the review by briefly discussing the emerging area of monitoring fluorescence, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, field phenotyping, and remote sensing of crops for yield and biomass enhancement.

AB  - Although grasslands harbour significant biodiversity and their restoration is common in biodiversity conservation, we know very little about how such interventions influence arthropod groups. Here we compared orthopteran assemblages in croplands, natural grasslands and one to four-year-old grasslands restored in a large-scale programme in Hortobagy National Park (East Hungary). We sampled orthopterans by standardized sweep-netting both in a repeated measures design from Year 0 (croplands) to 4 and in a space-for-time substitution (chronosequence) design in 2009. Species richness, abundance and Shannon diversity of orthopterans decreased in Year 1 following restoration, but increased afterwards. By Year 4, species richness doubled and abundance increased almost ten-fold in restored grasslands compared to croplands. Species composition diversified compared to croplands and progressed towards natural grasslands. Local restoration conditions (last crop, seed mixture) and landscape configuration (proportion of natural grasslands) did not influence the above patterns in either study design, whereas time since restoration affected almost all community variables. We found that ubiquitous generalist species were the first to appear in restored grasslands and that species characteristic to the target natural grasslands colonised gradually in later years. The qualitative and quantitative properties of the orthopteran assemblages in restored fields did not yet reach those of natural grasslands, therefore, our study suggests that the full regeneration of the orthopteran assemblages takes more than four years. We also concluded that the repeated-measures design was more sensitive to subtle changes and was thus more effective than the chronosequence design at detecting post-restoration changes in orthopteran assemblages.

AB  - A critical pluviometric event occurred in the central-eastern Ligurian Riviera, 15 km from Genoa, on 1 June 2007. This event caused landslides and hydraulic problems between Sori and Camogli and in the inland area of the Recco Valley.
   An analysis of the heavy rainfall was conducted. Hourly precipitation data revealed a critical event between 04:00 a.m. and 07:00 a.m. local time, with more than 220 mm of precipitation over three hours.
   Slope movements were mainly debris flows that detached from the lateral valleys of the Recco Stream catchment and from well-maintained, wooded slopes that were also characterised by cultivated terraces.
   Numerous slide planes corresponded to the interface between the surface cover and the underlying bedrock, which presents an unfavourable geologic structure in terms of stability assessment.
   In most cases, the displaced material had a limited thickness. Debris cover was rapidly channelled along small valleys, which controlled the critical hydraulic conditions in the secondary drainage network.
   Man-made drainage systems were partially or totally blocked in a very short time and, like the natural watercourses, accumulated thick and extensive alluvial fans.
   Most of the instability phenomena occurred in areas that had been designated medium or low-risk areas during land planning, and in sectors that were defined as stable, because they lacked geomorphic indicators connected to landslide risks.
   The above considerations highlight some gaps of the Recco Stream Master Plan. Therefore, to update this land planning tool, it is necessary to extensively investigate local geomorphological characteristics and to adopt a different method for assigning weights to the geohazard maps.

AB  - Introduction: Potentially preventable hospitalisation (PPH) has been adopted widely by international health systems as an indicator of the accessibility and overall effectiveness of primary care. The Assessing Preventable Hospitalisation InDicators (APHID) study will validate PPH as a measure of health system performance in Australia and Scotland. APHID will be the first large-scale study internationally to explore longitudinal relationships between primary care and PPH using detailed person-level information about health risk factors, health status and health service use.
   Methods and analysis: APHID will create a new longitudinal data resource by linking together data from a large-scale cohort study (the 45 and Up Study) and prospective administrative data relating to use of general practitioner (GP) services, dispensing of pharmaceuticals, emergency department presentations, hospital admissions and deaths. We will use these linked person-level data to explore relationships between frequency, volume, nature and costs of primary care services, hospital admissions for PPH diagnoses, and health outcomes, and factors that confound and mediate these relationships. Using multilevel modelling techniques, we will quantify the contributions of person-level, geographic-level and service-level factors to variation in PPH rates, including socioeconomic status, country of birth, geographic remoteness, physical and mental health status, availability of GP and other services, and hospital characteristics.
   Ethics and dissemination: Participants have consented to use of their questionnaire data and to data linkage. Ethical approval has been obtained for the study. Dissemination mechanisms include engagement of policy stakeholders through a reference group and policy forum, and production of summary reports for policy audiences in parallel with the scientific papers from the study.

AB  - Oxygen depletion can lead to the collapse of benthic ecosystems, i.e. to dead zones, and large-scale biodiversity loss. Based on mortality and survival, we evaluated ranges of sensitivity and tolerance to hypoxia levels, duration of anoxia and H2S exposure across taxa and key life habits. Experiments were conducted on a sublittoral soft-bottom under realistic in situ conditions in a community setting featuring both a well-developed epi- and infauna. Overall, 495 individuals representing 40 species were examined over almost 1000 h (using time-lapse camera and sensor arrays). Mortality started at dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations <0.5 ml l(-1) and centred at the transition from severe hypoxia to early anoxia. A total of 58% of the individuals belonging to 27 species died. Thirteen species (39 individuals) died exclusively during anoxia. All of the individuals that died during hypoxia, and most of those that died during anoxia, did so before the onset of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). In 11 species, all individuals survived: survival rates were highest among molluscs, anthozoans and ascidians. In contrast, most polychaetes, decapods and echino-derms died. Epifauna was more vulnerable than infauna, mobile forms were more vulnerable than sessile forms, and predators more vulnerable than deposit-feeders and suspension-feeders. While hypoxia primarily affected total abundance, anoxia significantly reduced the number of species. The former represents a quantitative, the latter a qualitative decline in ecosystem function. Most of the macrofauna may initially survive shorter-term (day-long) or intermittent hypoxia, but the onset of anoxia marks community collapse and biodiversity loss.

AB  - From analysis of spectrophotometric properties of dissolved organic matter (OM) and the hydrochemical responses of some karst springs under different hydrologic conditions, an assessment of the origin and transfer pathway of OM present in karst spring waters, from soil and epikarst toward the spring, has been conducted for three karst aquifers in southern Spain: Alta Cadena, Sierra de Enmedio and Los Tajos. Intrinsic fluorescence (excitation-emission matrices or EEMs), together with major water chemistry (electrical conductivity, temperature, alkalinity, Cl-, Mg+2) and P-CO2 along with natural hydrochemical tracers (TOC and NO3-), have been monitored in 19 springs which drain the three karst aquifers examined in this study. The spring water EEM spectra indicate that fulvic acid-like substances, produced in the soil as a consequence of the decomposition of OM, are the dominant fluorophores, although some of the OM appears to originate from in situ microbiological activity but could be indicative of contamination present in recharge waters from livestock. During each recharge event, TOC and NO3- concentrations increased and variations in fluorescence intensities of peaks attributed to fulvic acid-like compounds were observed. In areas with minimal soil development, spatial and temporal variations in the fluorescence intensity of fulvic acid-like substances and other fluorophores derived from microbiological activity, together with other hydrochemical parameters, provide insights into the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers and the infiltration velocity of water from soil and facilitate assessment of contamination vulnerability in these aquifers.

AB  - Within the scope of the Integrated Rhine Program an ecological flood gate and channel was inserted into the polder "Ingelheim" to enhance animal and plant diversity. In 2008, carabid beetles and springtails were collected, using pitfall traps, to measure the effects of ecological flooding and a strong precipitation event at a flood-disturbed and a dry location in this area. At both localities, xerophilic and mesophilic carabid beetle species were dominant throughout the study period. The total number of individuals of hygrophilic species was comparatively constant, while species number increased, partly due to the changed moisture conditions caused by ecological flooding and strong precipitation. Carabid beetle diversity and evenness decreased marginally when ecological flooding was absent. Springtails represent a less mobile arthropod order, and as such the impact of ecological flooding was stronger. An increase in both numbers of species and individuals of hygrophilic and hygrotolerant species occurred in the flood-disturbed location after ecological flooding. After the sites at both locations had dried, the number of individuals belonging to these species declined rapidly. In contrast to carabid species, the strong precipitation event showed no influence on hygrophilic springtail species. Thus, collembolan diversity and evenness decreased markedly in the absence of flooding. We showed that ecological flooding has an influence on the spatial and temporal dynamics of different arthropod groups that inhabit the polder "Ingelheim". These findings demonstrate the importance of using different arthropod groups as bioindicators in determining the ecological value of a particular polder design.

AB  - The ecological characteristics of ostracods in Lake Sunnet were monitored monthly between May 2005 and September 2007; 9 living and 5 subfossil ostracod taxa were recorded. Among the species, Ilyocypris getica was reported in Turkey for the first time; while Stenocypria fischeri was found for the second time in the country in 55 years. The most abundant species, Limnocythere inopinata, was collected in dry and wet months, while I. bradyi was the only species found in only the wet months. The 9 species clustered into 3 groups based on their ecological preference. Species composition and occurrences were closely related to the lake water level fluctuation, from 7 to 13 m within a year. These fluctuations played a significant role in changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the lake, along with ostracod species composition (P < 0.01). A strong negative correlation (P < 0.05) between precipitation and both ambient temperature and SO4 was also interpreted as the outcome of such fluctuations. The number of species corresponded with salinity changes. Most of the ostracod species appearing in Lake Sunnet were tolerant to the large water level fluctuation. These results correspond with the idea of 'pseudorichness,' when species composition is dominated by cosmopolitans over noncosmopolitans, an indication of low water quality in a lake. Changes in the lake have been accelerated by anthropogenic activities such as water diversions for chicken farms and agricultural fields during dry climatic conditions. The occurrence of these activities appears to have produced seasonal differences in the lake's water quality and species composition.

AB  - Rural landscapes are often multifunctional, meaning that atone single location different goods and services are being provided. Multifunctionality is spatially heterogeneous as not all areas are equally suitable to supply mu In pie goods and services. This suitability depends on favourable biophysical and socio-economic conditions and interactions among landscape functions. The objective of this paper is to identify and quantify interactions among landscape functions in a diverse and dynamic rural region, the Gelderse Valler in the Netherlands. To be able to study these interactions first seven landscape functions (residential, intensive livestock, Cultural heritage, tourism. plant habitat, arable production, and leisure cycling) are quantified and mapped using landscape indicators. These landscape function maps are Subsequently aggregated to identify and quantify multifunctionality. The results of these analyses are used to study three aspects of landscape function Interactions (a) Influence of landscape characteristics on function interactions, (b) interrelations among landscape functions and (c) effect of multifunctionality on the different landscape functions. Landscape functions do not equally interact with one another, some landscape functions are affected negatively by the presence of other functions while other landscape functions benefit from multifunctionality. At multifunctionality hot spots different landscape functions are present that are enhancing one another. Additionally, in our Study area it appears that mainly locations with landscape functions that sub-optimally provide goods and services are strongly Multifunctional. Quantification and an improved understanding of landscape interactions will help to design and evaluate spatial policies related to the provision of multiple goods and services by the landscape.

AB  - The Danjiangkou reservoir lies in the upper Hanjiang basin and is the source of water for the Middle Route Project (MRP) under the South-to-North Water Transfer Scheme (SNWT) in China. The eco-environment of water resource areas plays an important role in water conservation and purification and would have significant implications for the economic prosperity in Hanjiang basin as well as for the SNWT. Focusing on the Danjiangkou Reservoir Area (DRA), this study established an environmental information system database. Based on the database, an eco-environmental vulnerability assessment method using integrated fuzzy AHP (FAHP) and GIS was developed for the DRA. According to eco-environmental conditions and anthropic effects, vulnerability was classified into five levels: potential, light, medium, heavy and very heavy. The eco-environmental vulnerability distribution and major problems of the eco-environment were analysed and discussed. The results indicated that eco-environmental vulnerability in the DRA was moderate overall. Regions with lower eco-environmental vulnerability were located in Qinling Mountain area in the northwest, Daba Mountain area in the south and the area immediately surrounding Danjiangkou Reservoir in the east. Two regions with very high eco-environmental vulnerability were located in the north of Danjiangkou Reservoir in Henan province and in the western part of Shanxi province. On the basis of analysis of distribution of the different factors of eco-environmental vulnerability, different environmental protection measures were proposed for different areas. This study demonstrated that the proposed method was an effective approach for the assessment of environmental vulnerability. The results gained closely reflected the reality of the eco-environmental vulnerability of the DRA. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metals in floodplain soils and sediments (deposits) can originate from lithogenic and anthropogenic sources, and their availability for uptake in biota is hypothesized to depend on both origin and local sediment conditions. In criteria-based environmental risk assessments, these issues are often neglected, implying local risks to be often over-estimated. Current problem definitions in river basin management tend to require a refined, site-specific focus, resulting in a need to address both aspects. This paper focuses on the determination of local environmental availabilities of metals in fluvial deposits by addressing both the origins of the metals and their partitioning over the solid and solution phases. The environmental availability of metals is assumed to be a key force influencing exposure levels in field soils and sediments. Anthropogenic enrichments of Cu, Zn and Pb in top layers could be distinguished from lithogenic background concentrations and described using an aluminium-proxy. Cd in top layers was attributed to anthropogenic enrichment almost fully. Anthropogenic enrichments for Cu and Zn appeared further to be also represented by cold 2 M HNO(3) extraction of site samples. For Pb the extractions over-estimated the enrichments. Metal partitioning was measured, and measurements were compared to predictions generated by an empirical regression model and by a mechanistic-kinetic model. The partitioning models predicted metal partitioning in floodplain deposits within about one order of magnitude, though a large inter-sample variability was found for Pb. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Based on MODIS images, large-scale flow field charts and environmental monitoring data, we thoroughly analyzed the spatial distribution of wheat straw burning in North China, with focus on its environmental impacts on the air quality of Beijing and pollution transport paths. And we anatomized changes of air quality in Beijing under the impacts of pollution generated by wheat straw burning around. The results indicate that: (1) The North China Plain, a winter-wheat growing area, is the main source of pollutants induced by wheat straw burning in Beijing. The direction of south-west is the dominant heavy pollution transport path. (2) Impacts of wheat straw burning on air quality are mainly manifested by significantly increasing CO concentration. (3) Precursors of O-3 generated by wheat straw burning, combining with favorable meteorological conditions, can induce increasing O-3 concentration greatly. NO concentration will be greatly increased due to decreasing O-3 concentration at night. (4) Atmospheric particles, especially the fine ones, from wheat straw burning exert considerable influence on Beijing air quality. (5) Different contributions of wheat straw burning to pollutants are identified. Ratios of PM10/SO2, CO/SO2, etc., can be applied to indicate pollution extent of wheat straw burning. High ratios of PM10/SO2 and CO/SO2 show that the air quality was heavily impacted by wheat straw burning and these ratios can be employed as indicators of contribution of wheat straw burning to the degradation of Beijing air quality. (6) Randomness of wheat straw burning activities renders random outbreak of air pollution of this type. Regional and extensive wheat straw burning activities can cause serious air pollution event.

AB  - Molecular genetic markers, such as those from fecal Bacteroides microorganisms, can link microbial pollution with its source, and have been used successfully in studies of sheltered aquatic environments. Their applicability to wave-driven, open coast environments has not been tested. We assessed the contribution of a tidal outlet to surf zone water quality in coastal Orange County, California, USA by measuring three traditional culture-based fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) as well as the human-specific Bacteroides molecular marker (HF marker) at four shoreline locations. We found that total and fecal coliform levels were higher during low tides than high tides at two of the four stations, and that this effect was strongest at the mouth of the tidal lagoon and decayed with distance from the outlet. The HF marker was detected in 23% and 47% of samples from the tidal outlet and 26% and 41% of samples from an adjacent recreational beach in 2005 and 2006 respectively. Surprisingly, the station farthest from the tidal outlet had the highest occurrence of the HF marker. We found no relationship between FIB abundance and occurrence of the HF marker for individual samples, but that when the data were considered together by year, higher FIB abundance was correlated with a higher incidence of the HF marker. DNA sequences of the HF marker recovered from this site were > 99% similar to those recovered from other states and countries, suggesting low global diversity of this marker. These data provide strong support for the idea that multiple time points and physical conditions should be considered when assessing coastal water quality.

AB  - Antibiotics can be present in low concentrations in domestic wastewater, but little is known about their effect on bacteria in onsite wastewater treatment systems. Mesocosms, consisting of soil-filled lysimeters representing the leachfield of a septic system under aerated (AIR) and unaerated (LEACH) conditions, were used to study the effects of tetracycline addition (5 mg L-1) to septic tank effluent on tetracycline resistance in the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci, and on their removal. The mesocosms were dosed with antibiotic for 10 days, and effects monitored for 52 days. The fraction of resistant bacteria in mesocosm drainage water relative to that in septic tank effluent, Gamma(Res), for E. coli ranged from 0 to 0.66 in the AIR treatment and from 0 to 3.32 in the LEACH treatment. For fecal streptococci, Gamma(Res) ranged from 0 to 0.41 and from 0.63 to 1.06 in the AIR and LEACH treatments, respectively. No significant differences in antibiotic resistance of fecal indicator bacteria were observed among sampling dates in soil or water from either treatment. Tetracycline had no significant effect on removal of fecal indicator bacteria, which ranged from 99.9 to 100% for E. coli and from 95.9 to 100% for fecal streptococci. Our results suggest that short-term addition of tetracycline at environmentally-relevant concentrations is likely to have minimal consequences on pathogen removal from wastewater and development of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria in leach field soil.

AB  - The expressions of trypsin and chymotrypsin in the pyloric caeca of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) were studied in three experiments. Two internal (trypsin phenotypes, life stages) and three common external factors (starvation, feeding, temperatures) influencing growth rates were varied. Growth was stimulated by increased temperature and higher feeding rate, and it was depressed during starvation. The interaction between trypsin phenotype and start-feeding temperature affected specific activity of trypsin, but not of chymotrypsin. Trypsin specific activity and the activity ratio of trypsin to chymotrypsin (T/C ratio) increased when growth was promoted. Chymotrypsin specific activity, on the other hand, increased when there was a reduction in growth rate whereas fish with higher growth had higher chymotrypsin specific activity resulting in lower T/C ratio value. During a rapid growth phase, trypsin specific activity did not correlate with chymotrypsin specific activity. On the other hand, a relationship between specific activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin could be observed when growth declined, such as during food deprivation. Trypsin is the sensitive key protease under conditions favouring growth and genetically and environmentally affected, while chymotrypsin plays a major role when growth is limited or depressed. Trypsin specific activity and the T/C ratio value are shown to be important factors in the digestion process affecting growth rate, and could be applicable as indicators for growth studies of fish in captive cultures and in the wild, especially when food consumption rate cannot be measured.

AB  - The term epigenetics defines the heritable changes in gene expression that occur through changes in the chromatin structure, rather than changes in the DNA sequence. The methylation of cytosines (m(5)C) in CpG dinucleotides (DNA methylation) and the modification of histories are fundamental epigenetic mechanisms that regulate eukaryotic gene expression. In general, increases in DNA methylation are associated with gene silencing whereas decreases in DNA methylation are often associated with gene expression. As a result, DNA modification provides an additional level of genetic information by incorporating a fifth nucleotide into the genetic code. Epigenetic regulation has been shown to be important in cellular differentiation, embryonic development, and when abnormal - carcinogenesis and disease. Until recently studies investigating epigenetic modifications of DNA were restricted to looking at specific gene loci. High throughput genomic methods such large scale bisulphate sequencing, restriction landmark genome scanning (RLGS), CpG island microarrays and mass spectroscopy methods have now been developed that allow researchers to assay levels of DNA methylation and chromatin structure over wide areas of the genome or the entire genome - the epigenome or methylome. This new area of research has been termed epigenomics, and its aim is to describe the complete set of DNA methyation modifications within a cell. Comparative studies are presently being conducted in order to understand epigenomic differences in a number of systems. These included epigenome comparisons between undifferentiated and differentiated embryonic cells, cancerous and non-cancerous cell types, and cells exposed to varying environmental parameters. Studying global changes in DNA methylation has the potential to identify early indicators of carcinogenesis or biomarkers for conditions that alter the normal epigenomic status within an organism.

AB  - Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt. and Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) Schimp. samples from the Finnish Environmental Specimen Bank were used to study the UV-B-absorbing compounds as potential screens of the past radiation environment. The first series from southern and central Finland consisted of samples collected from 18 P. schreberi or H. splendens dominated sites in 1985 and 1995. The second series from four H. splendens dominated sites (two in southern and two in northern Finland) and two P. schreberi dominated sites (one southern and one northern) were from the years 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000. In the first series, the moss surface area of the analyzed specimens (5 +/- 0.2 mg DW) was smaller in 1995 (40% of both species collected in June) than in 1985 (40% of P. schreberi and 55% of H. splendens collected in September). The methanol-extractable UV-B-absorbing compounds of P. schreberi in 1985 and 1995 measured as absorbance at 10 nm intervals at 280-360 nm per mg DW revealed a negative correlation with reconstructed UV-radiation data. In the second series, the UV-B-absorbing compounds per specific surface area (surface area mm(2) per DW) showed significant differences between the years. The highest values in both species were obtained in 1990. In H. splendens, a difference between the southern and northern samples was observed. The preliminary study encouraged the use of environmental specimen bank samples to indicate changes in surface radiation conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - COLLOIDAL GOLD
AB  - In this paper we report the catalytic effects of various gold nanoparticles for silver electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO)-based electrodes, and successfully apply this methodology for signal amplification of the hybridization assay. The most widely used gold nanoparticle-based hybridization indicators all promote silver electrodeposition on the bare ITO electrodes, with decreasing catalytic capability in order of 10 nm gold, DNA probe-10 nm gold conjugate, streptavidin-5 nm gold, and streptavidin-10 nm gold. Of greater importance, these electrocatalytic characteristics are affected by any surface modifications of the electrode surfaces. This is illustrated by coating the ITO with an electroconducting polymer, poly(2-aminobenzoic acid) ( PABA), as well as avidin molecules, which are promising immobilization platforms for DNA biosensors. The catalytic silver electrodeposition of the gold nanoparticles on the PABA-coated ITO surfaces resembles that on the bare surfaces. With avidin covalently bound to the PABA, it is interesting to note that the changes in electrocatalytic performance vary for different types of gold nanoparticles. For the streptavidin-5 nm gold, the silver electrodeposition profile is unaffected by the presence of the avidin layer, whereas for both the 10 nm Au and DNA probe 10 nm gold conjugate, the deposition profiles are suppressed. The streptavidin-5 nm gold is employed as the hybridization indicator, with avidin-modified ( via PABA) ITO electrode as the immobilization platform, to enable signal amplification by the silver electrodeposition process. Under the conditions, this detection strategy offers a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. We believe that this protocol has great potential for simple, reproducible, highly selective and sensitive DNA detection on fully integrated microdevices in clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring applications.

AB  - Seven German and three Hungarian monumental sandstones have been tested in laboratory conditions to analyse the effect of heat. The studied quartz sandstones have a wide-range of cements and grain-sizes including silica-, carbonate-, clay- and ferrous mineral-cemented varieties of fine-, medium- to coarse-grained types. Cylindrical specimens were heated up to 150, 300, 450, 600, 750 and 900degreesC in an oven. The mineralogical and textural changes were recorded and compared by using microscopy, XRD, DTA-DTG and SEM. Colours and colour differences (a*, b*, L* values) were also measured and evaluated. Colour changes are related to mineral transformations. The most intense colour change is caused by the oxidation of iron-bearing minerals to hematite that takes place up to 900degreesC. When temperature increases the green glauconite becomes brownish while the chlorite changes to yellowish at first. The colour of burnt sandstone is not a direct indicator of burning temperature, since there are sandstones in which the burnt specimens are lighter and less reddish than the natural ones. Porosity increase is related to micro-cracking at grain boundaries (above 600degreesC) and within the grains (at and above 750degreesC) and mineral transformations. The clay mineral structure collapses at different temperatures (kaolinite up to 600degreesC, chlorite above 600degreesC) and leads to a slight increase in porosity. The most drastic change is observed in calcite cemented sandstones where the carbonate structure collapses at 750degreesC and CaO appears at 900degreesC. Subsequently it is transformed to portlandite due to absorption of water vapour from the air. This leads to the disintegration of sandstone at room temperature a few days after the heat shock.

AB  - The adsorption of gases N-2, H-2, O-2, and NH3 that play a role in ammonia synthesis have been studied on the Fe(111) crystal surface by Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy using an integrated ultrahigh vacuum/higla-pressure system. SFG spectra are presented for the dissociation intermediates, NH2 (similar to3325 cm(-1)) and NH (similar to3235 cm(-1)) under high pressure of ammonia (200 Torr) on the clean Fe(111) surface. Addition of 0.5 Torr of oxygen to 200 Torr of ammonia does not significantly change the bonding of dissociation intermediates to the surface. However, it leads to a phase change of nearly 180degrees between the resonant and nonresonant second-order nonlinear susceptibility of the surface, demonstrated as a reversal of the SFG spectral features. Heating the surface in the presence of 200 Torr of ammonia and 0.5 Torr of oxygen reduces the oxygen coverage, which can be seen from the SFG spectra as another relative phase change of 180degrees. The reduction of the oxide is also supported by Auger electron spectroscopy. The result suggests that the phase change of the spectral features could serve as a sensitive indicator of the chemical environment of the adsorbates. Clean Fe(111) is found to have a large SFG nonresonant signal. The magnitude of the nonresonant signal was dependent on the adsorption species; O-2 and N-2 decrease, while H-2 and NH3 increase the SFG nonresonant signal. The change in nonresonant signal is correlated to the change in work function for Fe(111) upon adsorption. Adsorption-induced changes in the SFG nonresonant signal was used as an indicator of surface conditions and to monitor surface reactions.

AB  - Discharge of inadequately treated wastewater into streams may result in the dissemination of pathogens and the contamination of surface water sources. Determining the die-off rate of pathogenic microorganisms in stream and sea waters may serve as the basis for evaluating the health risks posed by the presence of pathogens in seawater. This study was conducted to determine the effect of microbial load, temperature, salinity and turbidity on the die-off of oocysts of Cryptosporidium as compared to that of coxsackie A9 virus (Cox A9) and E coli. The test microorganisms were seeded into stream, outfall or sea waters and incubated at either 30 degreesC (summer) or 15 degreesC (winter). At 30 degreesC, the fastest die-off was observed for Cox A9 where <5-log was reduced regardless of the water quality. At 15 degreesC Cox A9 persistence was similar to that of Cryptosporidium where no change was detected in the concentration of either throughout the study period. E coli die-off reached 5 orders of magnitude within 10d then its concentration remained unchanged. The die-off of E coli was faster than observed for Cox A9 at 15 degreesC regardless of the water quality. No decrease was observed in the viability of Cryptosporidium under all tested conditions throughout the study period indicating the unsuitability of E coli to serve as an indicator for the presence of parasites and viruses in stream and marine waters. The prolonged persistence of pathogenic microorganisms in marine waters suggested that discharge of contamination into streams may present a serious environmental health risk.

AB  - The relationships between diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) in surface sediments of lakes and summer air temperature, pH and total organic carbon concentration (TOC) were explored along a steep climatic gradient in northern Sweden to provide a tool to infer past climate conditions from sediment cores. The study sites are in an area with low human impact and range from boreal forest to alpine tundra. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) constrained to mean July air temperature and pH clearly showed that diatom community composition was different between lakes situated in conifer-, mountain birch- and alpine-vegetation zones. As a consequence, diatoms and multivariate ordination methods can be used to infer past changes in treeline position and dominant forest type. Quantitative inference models were developed to estimate mean July air temperature, pH and TOC from sedimentary diatom assemblages using weighted averaging (WA) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression. Relationships between diatoms and mean July air temperature were independent of lake-water pH, TOC, alkalinity and maximum depth. The results demonstrated that diatoms in lake sediments can provide useful and independent quantitative information for estimating past changes in mean July air temperature (R-jack(2) = 0.62, RMSEP = 0.86 degrees C; R-2 and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) based on jack-knifing), pH (R(j)(2)ack = 0.61, RMSEP = 0.30) and TOC (R-jack(2) = 0.49, RMSEP = 1.33 mg l(-1)). The paper focuses mainly on the relationship between diatom community composition and mean July air temperature, but the relationships to pH and TOC are also discussed.

AB  - A similarity may be found between various:approaches for determining the effects of parallel fractures or aligned cracks on seismic wave propagation at wavelengths that are long compared with the scale length of the cracks. Fractures can be modeled using an empirical linear slip condition; however, natural fracture surfaces can also be simulated directly as planar distributions of small isolated areas of slip (cracks) (model 1) or, conversely, as planar distributions of imperfect interfacial contacts (model 2). An alternative is plane surfaces separated by thin continuous layers of viscous fluid or a soft material (model 3). We present analytic expressions for the fracture compliances for these three models and, using these-analytic results, compute the effective compliances and stiffnesses of the fractured material. As a result, it is possible to relate: the measured compliances or stiffnesses directly to the statistics of the microstructural details of a fracture, given appropriate a priori information on the fracture surfaces. The results for model 1 are equivalent to a volume distribution of cracks as studied by Hudson [1980, 1981] for small crack density; the results for model 2 are basically the same as those given by White [1983] for a packing of spheres; and finally, the results for model 3 are in agreement with those given by Backus [1962] for combinations of two constituent layers. These results can be extended to the case Of nonaligned fractures and to allow for fluid flow between cracks and into a porous matrix rock. Finally, it is shown that the ratio of the normal to shear fracture compliance is a good indicator of the properties of the fracture infill.

AB  - Fluctuations in freshwater input may affect the physiology and survival of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) occurring in oligoaline to mesohaline estuarine regions. Controls on the distribution of the freshwater angiosperm Vallisneria americana, were investigated by transplanting ramets. Pots (3.8-1) containing ramets were distributed among four sites (upstream site [least saline], donor site, near downstream site, and far downstream site [most saline]) in the Caloosahatchee Estuary (Southwest Florida) during wet (May-August) and dry (October-February) seasons. During 2-4 mo of each season, physiological indicators were monitored, including photosynthesis, glutamine synthetase activity, and protein content in shoots, and carbohydrates and total nitrogen and carbon in shoot and subterranean tissues. Where the physical environment (light or salinity) was suboptimal, all physiological indices, except photosynthetic rate, showed similar stress responses, which ranged from a slow decline to a rapid drop in physiological function. Levels of soluble carbohydrates decreased in response to unfavorable conditions more rapidly than did insoluble carbohydrates. Shoot protein of V. americana declined prior to transplant death, suggesting that measuring protein content may provide a rapid assessment of physiological health. V. americana transplants at the low-salinity upstream site died during both wet and dry season experiments, likely in response to light limitation and/or partial burial by sediments. At the far downstream site, death occurred within 2-4 wk, and was attributable to elevated salinities (> ca. 15 parts per thousand). Comparison of physiological responses with salinity and light regimes at the donor and near downstream sites suggest that light may ameliorate salinity stress. This study demonstrates that V: americana, nominally classed as a freshwater macrophyte, is capable of a remarkable degree of halotolerance.

LA  - English
AB  - Most of the world's economic and population growth is taking place in cities and, increasingly, many of the world's major challenges and problems have their loci in cities. Poverty, environmental degradation, lack of urban services, transport, local government management and inadequate shelter and access to land are among the main areas of concern. This paper outlines the history of social and urban indicators and their application through the UNCHS (Habitat) Indicators Programme as one of the major country preparation activities for Habitat PI. A list of 46 key indicators was endorsed for Habitat II, to be used with other indicators as the quantitative basis for country reporting on the status of human settlements. Some 109 countries participated in the UNCHS Indicators Programme, providing comparable data for 236 cities. The resulting Urban Indicators Database is a unique resource for examining the problems and conditions of human settlements, and will provide baseline data for future monitoring of the Global Plan of Action and national action plans prepared for Habitat II. The Indicators Programme also initiated capacity-building activities in which the indicators form the basis of national monitoring programmes and are used for training of officials at national and local government levels. A number of countries have set in place processes whereby the indicators from the Programme, often with some local adaptation, will be used to monitor major national programmes and will be collected in most urban areas. The values of the key urban indicators are presented here as regional averages and for countries of different levels of economic development. Preliminary analysis of the data reveals a wealth of information in support of known facts about human settlement activities, and sheds light on a number of new concerns.

AB  - Cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L.) were grown under controlled conditions and fumigated with either O-3, diluted automobile exhaust or a combination of both. The ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) was estimated as a measure of PSII activity. Activities of the enzymes catalase, glutathione reductase and guaiacol-dependent peroxidase and contents of the antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione were assayed as potential indicators of oxidative stress. The behavior of catalase and of PSII are of particular diagnostic interest because they require continuous repair in light. Exposures of up to 13 days to moderate concentrations of the pollutant gases alone did not induce striking changes in any of the activities that were assayed. Also when the plants were subjected to an additional stress treatment by exposing them to 4 short cold treatments (2h each at 0-4 degrees C in light on days 12-15 after sowing) which induced marked declines of the F-v/F-m ratio, the chlorophyll content and the catalase activity, these cold-induced symptoms of photodamage were not significantly enhanced by the fumigation treatments. However, increases of the activities of glutathione reductase and peroxidase observed during a period of recovery following the cold-exposures were markedly higher in O-3-fumigated plants, as compared to plants grown in filtered air or fumigated with car exhaust alone. The results emphasize that effects of moderate pollutant exposures may be latent or delayed over long time periods and that defence responses can be enhanced when plants are exposed to additional, naturally occurring stress situations.

AB  - Characterising and regulating spatial structure of forested landscapes is an important step towards shifting the traditional focus of forest management from managing resource hows, such as timber and wildlife habitat, to managing forests. Concerns about maintenance of forest ecosystems, biodiversity and wildlife, as well as economic benefits have lead to the concept of forest landscape management. The focus of forest landscape management, like contemporary management, is the management of forest structure. Forest landscape management, however, is based upon the premise that resource Bows as well as biodiversity levels and ecosystem processes are determined by the array and spatial arrangement of forest conditions, i.e. spatial structure, and its change over time.
   Using a quantitative description of spatial forest structure, we developed a forest landscape management design process. A geographic information system (GIS) based landscape management model was developed that incorporated harvesting intervention patterns (i.e. geographically referenced format of intervention) and forest performance indicators using spatial structure measurements. We demonstrate that geographically based harvesting patterns and performance indicators have the potential to design management for the creation of alternative forest landscapes of significantly different spatial structure.
   We conclude that forest landscape management, with its spatial structure focus, is a desirable evolution in forest management planning. It represents a common basis that various interest groups can use to communicate their values and objectives. Forest landscape management, however, is only possible with a GIS-based management design process in place. This must include: (i) a means of quantitatively measuring spatial structure so that objectives may be set and performance evaluated; (ii) a knowledge of what constitutes performance in spatial structure; (iii) a design toolkit of geographically referenced interventions; (iv) understanding of spatial forest dynamics; (v) a computer model.

AB  - A study on the predominant sources of organic matter and the main diagenetic processes in two different cyanobacterial mats from evaporite-controlled environments was performed. Fatty acids, hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones and aldehydes were analyzed in selected millimetre and submillimetre core sections. The changes in lipid composition were evaluated by comparison with the vertical distributions of the populations observed by optic microscopy and with the lipid patterns of enrichment cultures of species such as cyanobacteria, diatoms, purple bacteria, sulphate-reducers and methanogens obtained from the mats.
   The cyanobacteria Phormidium valderianum and Microcoleus chthonoplastes are the predominant primary producers, and occur almost as monocultures in the respective top layers. However, these mat-forming organisms only leave minor features in the solvent-extractable lipid sedimentary record. The predominant fatty acid distributions parallel the composition observed in the enrichment cultures of purple bacteria and appear mixed with acids characteristic of heterotrophic cubacteria such as sulphate-reducers. The concentrations of these lipids are, however, 5-10 times lower than the cyanobacterial acids from the top layer. De novo heterotrophic eubacterial synthesis is also observed in cases such as the highly branched isoprenoid eicosenes, the major hydrocarbon in the deep layers (> 2 mm) of the Phormidium mat. Other major diagenetic changes involve dehydration and hydrogenation. These two processes take place concurrently under anoxic conditions and have been observed among the sterols and the isoprenoid alcohols. Significant amounts of 5beta(H)-stanols were observed in the more reducing sections where molecular indicators of methanogenic bacteria were also found.

AB  - Background Historical loss in American Indians (AIs) is believed to contribute to high incidence of mental health disorders, yet less is known about the associations between historical loss and physical health.
   Purpose To investigate whether frequency of thought about historical loss predicts risk factors for chronic physical health conditions in an AI community.
   Methods Using Community Based Participatory research (CBPR) and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), we measured frequency of thoughts about historical loss in 100 AI adults residing on the Blackfeet reservation. Participants completed a 1-week monitoring period, during which ambulatory blood pressure and daily levels of psychological stress were measured. At the end of the week, we collected a dried blood spot sample for measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP).
   Results In hierarchical linear regression models controlling for demographics and relevant covariates, greater frequency of thoughts about historical loss predicted higher average daily psychological stress (B = .55, t = 6.47, p < .001, Delta R-2 = .30) and higher levels of CRP (B = .33, t = 3.93, p < .001, Delta R-2 = .10). Using linear mixed modeling with relevant covariates, we found that greater thoughts about historical loss were associated with higher systolic ambulatory blood pressure (B = .32, 95% CI = .22-.42, t = 6.48, p < .001, Delta R-2 = .25; Fig. 1c) and greater diastolic ambulatory blood pressure (B = .19, 95% CI = .11-.27, t = 4.73, p < .001, Delta R-2 = .19).
   Conclusions The data suggest that frequency of thought about historical loss may contribute to increased subclinical risk for cardiovascular disease in the Blackfeet community.

AB  - Wind farms (WFs) experience various challenges that affect their performance. Mostly, designers focus on the technical side of WFs performance, mainly increasing the power production of WFs, through improving their manufacturing and design quality, wind turbines capacity, their availability, reliability, maintainability, and supportability. On the other hand, WFs induce impacts on their surroundings, these impacts can be classified as environmental, social, and economic, and can be described as the sustainability performance of WFs. A comprehensive tool that combines both sides of performance, i.e. the technical and the sustainability performance, is useful to indicate the overall performance of WFs. An overall performance index (OPI) can help operators and stakeholders rate the performance of WFs, more comprehensively and locate the weaknesses in their performance. The performance model for WFs, proposed in this study, arranges a set of technical and sustainability performance indicators in a hierarchical structure. Due to lack of historical data in certain regions where WFs are located, such as the Arctic, expert judgement technique is used to determine the relative weight of each performance indicator. In addition, scoring criteria are predefined qualitatively for each performance indicator. The weighted sum method makes use of the relative weights and the predefined scoring criteria to calculate the OPI of a specific WF. The application of the tool is illustrated by a case study of a WF located in the Norwegian Arctic. Moreover, the Arctic WF is compared to another WF located outside the Arctic to illustrate the effects of Arctic operating conditions on the OPI.

AB  - Although one of the most harmful factors to health is noise, it is often ignored in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. Most researches regarding noise inclusion in LCA focus on the problem of transport noise, and very few works consider the impact of noise emitted by other sources. This study addresses the effects of noise generated by cogeneration plants. The main objective is to assess the environmental performance of the noise reduction system by considering the health effects of noise due to steam discharge as well as to compare the environmental loss associated with the production and disposal of a steam silencer with the benefits resulting from its application for noise reduction. A method to determine midpoint and endpoint human health indicators for a composition of noise emitted by intermittent stationary source and background noise is developed. The results indicate that the health benefit due to noise reduction is six orders of magnitude greater than the environmental loss. Human health indicators attributable to noise reduction in the residential zones under consideration span a wide range of disability adjusted life years (DALY)-0.16-136 DALY. The greatest values occur in the densely populated areas located close to the noise source. A formula is proposed to express annoyance of the residents of individual zones depending on their distance to the steam discharge source, its sound power level, and existing background noise level. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses have been carried out assuming other conditions. Modifications of sound power level, noise reduction efficiency, steam discharge duration, and the silencer lifetime have not affected the overall conclusion drawn.

AB  - Under the influence of the change in the overall economic environment, the problem of measuring the performance of a company and its financial health is also changing. At present, every agricultural company is exposed to a number of internal as well as external risks, the failure of which can lead to potential bankruptcy. It is a known fact that the risks in agriculture are significantly greater than those in other sectors of the national economy. Proper diagnosis of critical aspects and measuring the development of individual financial indicators of agricultural holdings are basic prerequisites for eliminating these risks and maintaining, as well as increasing, their competitiveness. Among the key tools for measuring the financial situation of a company are bankruptcy models, three of which have been used (Altman model, Taffler model, and Bonity index). The aim of this study was to identify the comprehensive financial health of 469 agricultural enterprises in the Slovak Republic using the three above-mentioned bankruptcy models in 2016. The obtained results were verified using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Levene test, or Moran index. Altman's model indicated potential future problems of businesses and agricultural cooperatives. Using the Bonity index, the neutral situation was assessed (the financial health could be regarded as neither insufficient nor optimal). Taffler model offered contradicted results and does not expect the occurrence of problems soon. In the study, we also verified the assumption of the dependence of financial health of companies on the legal form and territorial division, which was confirmed to be insignificant.

AB  - Air quality index (AQI) is an indicator usually issued on a daily basis to inform the public how good or bad air quality recently is or how it will become over the next few days, which is of utmost importance in our life. To provide a more practicable way for AQI prediction, so that residents can clear about air conditions and make further plans, five imperative meteorological indicators are elaborately selected. Accordingly, taking these indicators as independent variables, a fuzzy multiple linear regression model with Gaussian fuzzy coefficients is proposed and reformulated, based on the linearity of Gaussian fuzzy numbers and Tanaka's minimum fuzziness criterion. Subsequently, historical data in Shanghai from March 2016 to February 2018 are extracted from the government database and divided into two parts, where the first half is statistically analyzed and used for formulating four seasonal fuzzy linear regression models in views of the special climate environment of Shanghai, and the second half is used for prediction to validate the performance of the proposed model. Furthermore, considering that there is beyond dispute that triangular fuzzy number is more prevalent and crucial in the field of fuzzy studies for years, plenty of comparisons between the models based on the two types of fuzzy numbers are carried out by means of the three measures including the membership degree, the fuzziness and the credibility. The results demonstrate the powerful effectiveness and efficiency of the fuzzy linear regression models for AQI prediction, and the superiority of Gaussian fuzzy numbers over triangular fuzzy numbers in presenting the relationships between the meteorological factors and AQI.

AB  - Air pollution is a public health and environmental issue that affects human health. In recent years, it has received more and more attention and research from domestic scholars. In order to explore the impact of atmospheric fine particulate matter pollution on various functions of the human body during high-intensity exercise, this article conducts experiments with 30 male athletes as the research object. Before starting the experiment, we record the various indicators of these athletes' human body function as the comparison group data, and record the various indicators of these athletes' human body function after the experiment as the experimental group data. During the experiment, the living environment of these athletes is polluted by atmospheric fine particles. During the experiment, the air pollution of the area is monitored and used as experimental data. Finally, statistical analysis is carried out on the experimental data. The results show that atmospheric fine particulate matter pollution can reduce the cardiopulmonary function, immune function, and free radical content of high-intensity exercise humans. The vital capacity of the comparison group is 2.52 0.63 (L), while the vital capacity of the experimental group exercising under pollution conditions is 2.37 0.42 (L), showing significantly difference (P<0.05). The CC16 value of the experimental group is 18.43 1.13 (ps/L) which is much lower than 28.32 1.59 (kg/L) in the comparison group. The value of active oxygen in the heart of the experimental group is 2.57 0.79 (U/mol"prot), which is also far lower than that of the comparison group.

AB  - In the context of growing global urbanization and climate fluctuations, understanding the development of forest ecosystems in terms of their ability to remove atmospheric carbon is of increasing interest. Its content in the atmosphere continues to increase due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Airborne laser scanning technology has become widely used in assessing the biomass of trees by remotely registering such taxation indicators of trees, such as the width of the crown and the height of the tree. There are many allometric biomass models of different tree species in different climatic conditions, but allometric models for estimating biomass by remote methods are presented by single works.
   The authors use the base of harvest data of 138 sample trees of larch (Larix spp.) and 93 ones of stone pines (Pinus L. subsection Cembrae Loud.) growing on Eurasia with measured indicators of tree height, crown width, as well as the biomass of the trunk, foliage, branches and roots. For all components of aboveground biomass, a positive relationship with the crown width and the tree height was established.
   The results obtained give an vision of how the structure of the biomass of equal-sized trees of such species as larch and stone pine can differ, whether this structure can change in the climatic gradients of Eurasia, what can be the contribution of climate variables to the explanation of the variability of tree biomass, and what are the potential possibilities of laser technology for recognizing tree species at the level of individual trees.

AB  - The main target of this study is to evaluate the sustainability of existing mix proportions of the concrete to find the best option for pavement deicing in bridge in Tehran. Based on data availability, the meteorological condition in Tehran, and interviews with experts, 12 conductive concrete mixes, which were evaluated in previous studies, were proposed in this study. Sustainable indicators were selected based on data availability, proposed life cycle assessment indicators by CEN TC350, and experts' opinions. Weights and effect values of the indicators were determined based on interviews with experts. Values of two indicators, including compressive strength and resistivity, were extracted from the previous studies. Existing numerical models were used to determine the values of other indicators. A composite sustainability index and an applied effect of changes intensity in each indicator (AECIEI) methods were used to sort the mix proportions. Results show that the AECIEI method is more accurate for megacities, where several critical environmental and social problems exist because it can apply the effect of critical indicators and the intensity of the changes on sustainability. Mix proportion 1, in which steel wastes were used as the conductive material, is selected as the best option with compressive strength of 37.77 MPa, resistivity of 5.69 ohm m. This mix proportion can increase the temperature by 18.8 degrees C and can increase the temperature from - 10 to 3 degrees C during 103.723 min.

AB  - Palms (Arecaceae) are a relatively speciose family and provide materials for food, construction, and handicraft, especially in the tropics. They are frequently used as paleo-indicators for megathermal climates, and therefore, it is logical to predict that palms will benefit from predicted warmer temperatures under anthropogenic climate change. We created species distribution models to explore the projected ranges of five widespread southeastern North American palm species (Rhapidophyllum hystrix,Sabal etonia,Sabal minor,Sabal palmetto, andSerenoa repens) under four climate change scenarios through 2070. We project that the amount of habitat with >50% suitability forS. etoniawill decline by a median of 50% by 2070, while the amount of habitat with >50% suitabilityS. minorwill decline by a median of 97%. In contrast, the amount of suitable habitat forRhapidophyllum hystrixwill remain stable, while the amount of suitable habitat forSerenoa repenswill slightly increase. The projected distribution forS. palmettowill increase substantially, by a median of approximately 21% across all scenarios. The centroid of the range of each species will shift generally north at a median rate of 23.5 km/decade. These five palm species have limited dispersal ability and require a relatively long time to mature and set fruit. Consequently, it is likely that the change in the distribution of these palms will lag behind the projected changes in climate. However, Arecaceae can modify physiological responses to heat and drought, which may permit these palms to persist as local conditions become increasingly inappropriate. Nonetheless, this plasticity is unlikely to indefinitely prevent local extinctions.

AB  - Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is one of the most expensive spices in the world. At the international trading and pharmaceutical market, an establishment of saffron quality in accordance with the International Standardization Organization (ISO) specifications, the European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, and European Pharmacopeia is obligatory. The medicinal properties of saffron can be used in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries if the quality of raw materials is clearly controlled on all levels of production. In 2015, the scale cultivation of saffron in the Kherson region (Ukraine) for food purposes was started. Therefore, it was decided to develop the standard operating procedure of saffron cultivation in accordance with the Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) rules to ensure the traceability of the plant material origin. For this purpose, saffron was grown in seven different experimental zones with a disparity of altitudes, soils and climates of Ukraine. Each saffron sample harvested in 2016/2018 was processed to determine the moisture content, total ash and amount of picrocrocin, crocins, and safranal using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy according to the ISO 3632. The best yield was 40 g/100 m(2) in Cherson region. To obtain a stable crop and quality, the cultivation and harvest processing of saffron should be carried out in accordance with the proposed GACP standards. In addition, the quality of raw materials complies with the standards of European Pharmacopoeia and Deutscher Arzneimittel Codex as a medicinal plant material. Our analysis showed that Ukraine has a good ecological conditions and indicators for saffron cultivation as a food spice and pharmaceutical drugs.

AB  - Understanding the spatial structure of microphytobenthos (MPB) on intertidal flats is necessary to gain insight in the benthic community structure and ecosystem processes. The increasing availability of high resolution satellite sensors provides the opportunity to better understand spatial patterns of MPB on various (meter to km) scales. We tested how MPB patch size (indicated by the range derived from a semi-variogram) and degree of patchiness (indicated by the sill) vary as function of seasons, salinity, tidal flat type (muddy fringing versus sandy mid-channel tidal flats) or ecotopes (defined by hydrodynamics, silt content and elevation), in the Westerschelde estuary, the Netherlands. We used Sentinel-2 imagery (2016-2019) with 10 m spatial resolution to derive (omnidirectional) semi-variogram parameters from the NDVI (used as indicator for MPB biomass) and evaluated (seasonality in) patchiness of MPB in the different categories. We demonstrated that MPB patch size (the range) remains constant from winter to summer, while the sill increased from winter to summer. The location of patches on tidal flats was variable throughout the year and shows a remarkable similarity with seasonality in the spatial heterogeneity of the silt content on tidal flats. The patch size and degree of patchiness is higher on relatively sandy mid-channel tidal flats than on relatively silt rich fringing tidal flats. This implies that spatial patterning of MPB biomass on the meso-scale is likely closely linked to abiotic conditions and that spreading processes or grazing activity play a minor role. We observed visually that some areas with a relatively high MPB biomass ('patches') remain visible throughout the year, while other patches were only present during a particular season.

AB  - In this study, we examined the evolutionary outcome of and interplay between historic isolation and current selection pressures on traits more or less closely connected to fitness in the Pearly Heath butterfly (Coenonympha arcania) across its range in Europe. We hypothesized that a trait mean is more related to historic events if it has low connection to fitness, while a trait more closely connected with fitness is expected to have a mean that relates more to current selection pressures. In order to test this, we collected 322 butterflies from across the species range in Europe and measured five wing traits relating to size and color patterns. To infer a phylogeographic history for each individual, we sequenced a 594 bp fragment of the COI gene. The morphological data were then analyzed in relation to selected climatic variables and the history of individuals to disentangle which factors best correlated with morphological variation. The results supported our hypothesis in that wing sizes correlated with summer precipitation but not with its inferred location during the last glaciation. Eyespot position, on the other hand, correlated with the history of individuals but not with the analyzed climatic indicators. The sizes of the black spot and the white band, two traits that were expected to have intermediate selection pressure, were associated with both history and current conditions. Thus, this study illustrates the fascinating interplay between events and processes that lead to a specific evolutionary outcome.

AB  - Validation of the performance of guided wave structural health monitoring systems is vital if they are to be widely deployed; testing the damage detection ability of a system by introducing different types of damage at varying locations is very costly and cannot be performed on a system in operation. Estimating the damage detection ability of a system solely by numerical simulations is not possible as complex environmental effects cannot be accounted for. In this study, a methodology was tested and verified that uses finite element simulations to superimpose defect signals onto measurements collected from a defect-free structure. These signals are acquired from the structure of interest under varying environmental and operational conditions for an initial monitoring period. Measurements collected in a previous blind trial of an L-shaped pipe section, onto which a number of corrosion-like defects were introduced, were utilised during this investigation. The growth of three of these defects was replicated using finite element analysis and the simulated reflections were superimposed onto signals collected on the defect-free test pipe. The signal changes and limits of reliable detection predicted from the synthetic defect reflections superimposed on the measurements from the undamaged complex structure agreed well with the changes due to real damage measured on the same structure. This methodology is of great value for any structural health monitoring system as it allows for the minimum detectable defect size to be estimated for specific geometries and damage locations in a quick and efficient manner without the need for multiple test structures while accounting for environmental variations.

AB  - The management of beekeeping on forest lands is a vivid manifestation of the multifunctional use of forests, which is based on its target cultivation. The work shows the development of beekeeping, identifies factors affecting the sustainable development of this industry, sets priorities for increasing the efficiency of utilization of forest honey resources of the Southern Urals, including the main melliferous - Tilia cordata Mill. The nature and characteristics of the influence of weather and climatic factors on the growth of bee colonies, their physiological state, composition, age representation of natural melliferous woody plants, the onset dates and the duration of their flowering were determined. It was found that, of the silvicultural and inventory indicators, the composition and age, density and type of forest most strongly influence the yield of honey. The activities of forest care are close to them in terms of importance. A system of organizational measures has been proposed, through which high efficiency of using forest feed resources and sustainable development of beekeeping can be achieved: keeping an optimal number of bee colonies in an apiary - up to 150 hives, based on providing one bee colony of 50-60 thousand individuals with at least 130 kg of nectar; the location of apiaries in the 3-kilometer zone of growth of forest melliferous plants, taking into account the productive emergence of bees in the 2.5-3.0 km; establishing clear nomadic routes based on a geobotanic inventory of forest and agricultural melliferous plants. Increasing the target indicator - the nectar productivity of forests without a gap in their use both in space and in time - can be achieved by growing multi-tiered forests of different age from Tilia cordata Mill.

AB  - Phytoplankton is an important indicator of, and responder to, environmental changes. This study aims to reveal the response of a phytoplankton community to environmental changes, especially the level of nutrients in the Bohai Sea. The distribution pattern of net-phytoplankton communities in the central Bohai Sea and the Bohai Strait in winter and summer were studied, and the relationship between the phytoplankton communities and environment was explored. The results showed that diatoms (e.g. A. octonarius, Paralia sulcata and Detonula pumila) dominated the phytoplankton communities in winter, while diatoms (e.g. Chaetoceros sp. and Thalassiothrix frauenfeldii) and dinoflagellates (e.g. Ceratium fusus and Ceratium tripos) were both dominant in summer. By cluster analysis, the phytoplankton communities were divided into three clusters in winter and two in summer. The community that inhabited the waters around Qinhuangdao had higher abundance and distinct taxa composition in winter, related to the higher level of DIN and phosphate. Influenced by different water masses (the Yellow Sea Warm Current and the Bohai Sea Coastal Current), the phytoplankton community composition in the northern and southern parts of the Bohai Strait were also significantly different in winter. In summer, the difference in abundance and dominant species between the two phytoplankton communities was more closely linked to the N:P ratio in the environment. These results reflect that both nutrient level and hydrodynamic condition greatly influence the phytoplankton communities in the central Bohai Sea and the Bohai Strait. Our study will provide basic data for the eutrophication and environmental changes in the Bohai Sea.

AB  - In the present study, ascorbic acid (AA) induced persulfate activation was investigated for the further exploration of organic pollutants oxidation by persulfate. We interestingly found that AA showed a significant catalytic activity to persulfate. Under neutral pH and room temperature condition, about 71.3% of pentachlorophenol (PCP, 10 mg L-1) was decomposed in 180 min with 40 mmol L-1 persulfate and 1.0 mmol L-1 AA, while only 15.4% and 3.2% of PCP was removed by alone persulfate and AA respectively. The result of EPR spectra identified sulfate radical (SOIn and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) were generated during the reaction between persulfate and AA. Quenching experiments confirmed that both SO4 center dot(-) and center dot OH contributed to the decomposition of PCP. With the addition of AA augmented from 0 to 1 mmol L-1, the PCP degradation ratio continuously increased. However, excess AA could consume the generated reactive oxygen species (ROSs) that led to the inhibition of PCP degradation. Meanwhile, the PCP degradation by persulfate-AA was strongly pH dependent. The PCP degradation rate was declined as the initial pH increased from 3.5 to 10.5. At pH above 12.5, the base activation began to predominate over AA activation of persulfate. Furthermore, it was observed that the AA inducing persulfate activation was related to the extent of AA ionization, while C6H8O6 promoted the highest persulfate activation for the PCP degradation, and C6H6O1-induced the lowest persulfate activation. This study indicates the high potential of AA induced persulfate activation for treatment of organochlorine contaminated water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Baltic Sea hypoxia has been increased considerably since the first oxygen measurements became available in 1898. In 2016 the annual maximum extent of hypoxia covered an area of the sea bottom of about 70,000km(2), comparable with the size of Ireland, whereas 150years ago hypoxia was presumably not existent or at least very small. The general view is that the increase in hypoxia was caused by eutrophication due to anthropogenic riverborne nutrient loads. However, the role of changing climate, e.g. warming, is less clear. In this study, different causes of expanding hypoxia were investigated. A reconstruction of the changing Baltic Sea ecosystem during the period 1850-2008 was performed using a coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean circulation model. To disentangle the drivers of eutrophication and hypoxia a series of sensitivity experiments was carried out. We found that the decadal to centennial changes in eutrophication and hypoxia were mainly caused by changing riverborne nutrient loads and atmospheric deposition. The impacts of other drivers like observed warming and eustatic sea level rise were comparatively smaller but still important depending on the selected ecosystem indicator. Further, (1) fictively combined changes in air temperature, cloudiness and mixed layer depth chosen from 1904, (2) exaggerated increases in nutrient concentrations in the North Sea and (3) high-end scenarios of future sea level rise may have an important impact. However, during the past 150years hypoxia would not have been developed if nutrient conditions had remained at pristine levels.

AB  - We have employed a computer-aided approach to select and design task-specific organic solvents for the liquid-liquid extraction of ephedrine from its aqueous solution. We have identified three solvent performance indicators (SPIs) as the shortlisting criteria for solvents with desirable properties: high ephedrine solubility; low solvent loss; and high partition coefficient. Other properties that were considered include octanol-water partition coefficient and toxicity, which give a measure of the safety/health/environmental (SHE) impacts, and liquid viscosity, which is an important process design parameter. We have first analyzed the trends in these SPIs for a range of common organic solvents. Toluene (currently employed for the extraction of R-phenylacetylcarbinol, the precursor to ephedrine) has low solvent loss but relatively poor values of the other SPIs for ephedrine extraction, though with a relatively benign SHE impact. We are unable to identify a solvent (from the list of common organic solvents) that satisfies all the shortlisting criteria for use in the pharmaceutical industry and this provided the motivation for the design of task-specific solvents. We have designed organic solvents (acyclic aliphatic, aromatic with one side chain attachment, and aromatic with two side chain attachments) with superior values of SPIs than the reference solvent, toluene. We have employed limiting values on the melting and boiling points to ensure the designed solvents are liquids at the operating conditions. Designed aliphatic compounds contain the chloro-group(s), whereas there are aromatic solvents without the chloro-groups with better SPIs than toluene. Designed solvents without chloro-groups may be considered as the starting point for further screening experiments.

AB  - Objectives The Richter Scale measures the magnitude of a seismic occurrence, but it does not feasibly quantify the magnitude of the "disaster" at the point of impact in real humanitarian needs, based on United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR; Geneva, Switzerland) 2009 Disaster Terminology. A Disaster Severity Index (DSI) similar to the Richter Scale and the Mercalli Scale has been formulated; this will quantify needs, holistically and objectively, in the hands of any stakeholders and even across timelines. Background An agreed terminology in quantifying "disaster" matters; inconsistency in measuring it by stakeholders posed a challenge globally in formulating legislation and policies responding to it. Methods A quantitative, mathematical calculation which uses the median score percentage of 100% as a baseline, indicating the ability to cope within the local capacity, was used. Seventeen indicators were selected based on the UNISDR 2009 disaster definition of vulnerability and exposure and holistic approach as a pre-condition. The severity of the disaster is defined as the level of unmet needs. Thirty natural disasters were tested, retrospectively, and non-parametric tests were used to test the correlation of the DSI score against the indicators. Results The findings showed that 20 out of 30 natural disasters tested fulfilled the inability to cope, within local capacity in disaster terminology. Non-parametric tests showed that there was a correlation between the 30 DSI scored and the indicators. Conclusion By computing a median fit percentage score of 100% as the ability to cope, and the correlation of the 17 indicators, in this DSI Scale, 20 natural disasters fitted into the disaster definition. This DSI will enable humanitarian stakeholders to measure and compare the severity of the disaster objectively, as well as enable future response to be based on needs.

AB  - The relationship between rare earth elements (REEs) and the age of Cretaceous kerogens or petroleum source rocks is not known. In this study, kerogen samples isolated from petroleum source rocks from the Cretaceous Orange Basin, South Africa were analyzed for rare earth elements (REEs) and trace elements using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The rare earth elements were profiled in order to determine their relationship to the origin, depositional environment, and age of petroleum source rocks. Most of the rare earth elements identified are of the light REEs series (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) while the trace elements (V, Ni, Mo, and Co) determined are those that are known to have influence on the origin and depositional environment. The results show that the kerogens are mainly of marine origin. The ratios calculated from the concentrations of the elements were able to discriminate marine organic matter from lacustrine organic matter, and also indicate that the organic matter was deposited under anoxic conditions. All the kerogen samples irrespective of the age have similar elemental distribution pattern, indicating a similar genetic origin that could be a reflection of similar organic matter input and depositional environment. The kerogen age has a significant effect on the concentration of the REEs; concentrations of the REEs increase with age. That is, the older the kerogen the greater the content of rare earth elements. Furthermore, the abundance of cerium may be a good indicator of the origin of organic matter. The study also showed that the REEs provide a unique geochemical signature of the kerogens, which can be used for fingerprinting petroleum source rocks.

AB  - The goal of hydraulic stimulation is to increase formation permeability in the near vicinity of a well. However, there remain technical challenges around measuring the outcome of this operation. During two enhanced geothermal system stimulations in South Australia, Paralana in 2011 and Habanero in 2003, extensive catalogs of microseismicity were recovered. It is often assumed that shear failure of existing fractures is the main mechanism behind both the induced earthquakes and any permeability enhancement. This underpins a common notion that the seismically active volume is also the stimulated reservoir. Here we compute the density of earthquake hypocenters and provide evidence that, under certain conditions, this spatiotemporal quantity is a reasonable proxy for pore pressure increase. We then apply an inverse modeling approach that uses the earthquake observations and a modified reservoir simulator to estimate the parameters of a permeability evolution relation. The regime implied by the data indicates that most permeability enhancement occurred very near to the wellbore and was not coincident with the bulk of the seismicity, whose volume was about 2 orders of magnitude larger. Thus, we conclude that, in some cases, it is possible for permeability enhancement and induced seismicity to be decoupled, in which case the seismically active volume is a poor indicator of the stimulated reservoir. Our results raise serious questions about the effectiveness of hydroshearing as a stimulation mechanism in enhanced geothermal system. This study extends our understanding of the complex processes linking earthquakes, fluid pressure, and permeability in both natural and engineered settings.

AB  - Bark coal is found only in Late Permian age coals, and only at some specific locations in Southern China. The depositional environment of bark coal is not yet well understood. As a contribution to improving the understanding of the origin of this unusual coal component, the petrological characteristics and organic geochemistry of bark coal were investigated by gas chromatography (GC) analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, and coal petrology techniques. The samples were selected from the B-3 coal seam in the Mingshan coal mine, Leping area, in the south of China. The thermal maturity and organic matter type of the samples were determined by Rock-Eval analysis and from organic geochemical data. Barkinite occurs were commonly in the middle and upper parts, and less commonly in the lower parts, of the B3 coal seam. Barkinite is type II kerogen, while other samples are type II-III kerogen, consistent with good hydrocarbon-generation potential. The thermal maturity of the samples is consistent with their being of early-mature to peak oil window maturity. Gas chromatograms obtained from the samples are dominated by long chain n-alkanes (n-C-22 to n-C-27) and high Carbon Preference Index (CPI) values, indicating terrestrial organic matter input. The biomarker parameters obtained from mass spectrometer data on m/z 191 and m/z 217 indicate that the formation of these samples was influenced by marine environment and the deposited organic matter was preserved under relatively oxic conditions.

AB  - alpha-Ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), a pivotal metabolite in energy metabolism, has been implicated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and several cancers. It is recently proposed that plasma alpha-KG is a surrogate biomarker of NAFLD. Here, we report the development of a novel "turn-on" chemosensor for alpha-KG that contains a coumarin moiety as a fluorophore. Using benzothiazole-coumarin (BTC) as inspiration, we designed a probe for calcium ion recognition that possesses a unique fluorophore compared with previously reported probes for alpha-KG measurement. This chemosensor is based on the specific Schiff base reaction and the calcium ion recognition property of the widely used calcium indicator BTC. The probe was synthesized, and a series of parallel experiments were conducted to optimize the chemical recognition process. Compared to the initial weak fluorescence, a remarkable 7.6-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity (I/I0 at 495 nm) was observed for the conditions in which the probe (1 aemol/L), alpha-KG (50 mu mol/L), and Ca2+ (100 aemol/L) were incubated at 30(1/4)C in EtOH. The probe displayed good selectivity for alpha-KG even in an environment with an abundance of amino acids and other interfering species such as glutaric acid. We determined that the quantitative detection range of alpha-KG in EtOH was between 5 and 50 mu mol/L. Finally, probe in serum loaded with alpha-KG (10 mmol/L) showed a 7.4-fold fluorescence enhancement. In summary, a novel probe for detecting the biomarker alpha-KG through a typical Schiff base reaction has been discovered. With further optimization, this probe may be a good alternative for detecting the physiological metabolite alpha-KG.

AB  - The concepts of animal welfare and well-being in farm animals gain societally and politically in importance. A basic consensus in the understanding of animal welfare may be seen both in Germany and internationally, in politics as well as in science: apart from health, well-being has to be considered too. Whether this describes emotions, adaptability of the animal or fulfilling species-specific behaviour, is a question of interpretation that differs with the various representatives. However, the relevance of assessment protocols and evaluating systems to measure animal welfare is undisputed and already established on European and national level, although their welfare indicators are often limited to parameters of health, housing and management. Generally, animal welfare indicators can be grouped as resource-, management- and animal based. The former includes behaviour-based indicators, which, despite its difficult acquisition and lower reliability, provide a higher validity of the individual's animal welfare, possibly as well as the herd's, than the mere recording of health and environmental data. A scientific validation of these animal-based and behaviour-oriented animal welfare indicators is still pending. Both, the consideration of the dairy cow's specific housing needs and provision of the opportunity to fulfil species-specific behaviour, are important to assure the cow's welfare. Due to current German husbandry conditions these aspects are only considered for a proportion of dairy cattle. Standardized valid animal welfare indicators may be able to improve livestock husbandry and may contribute greatly to expand the product range of welfare-conform food, which is to be supported from the customer's point of view.

AB  - The study of the relationship between the socio-economic characteristics of territories of residence and the predictors of addictive behavior represents scientific novelty of study. The relevance of study is determined by the recognition of role of environmental factors in complex prevention of such negative phenomenon and by its destructive effect on psychological safety of modern sociocultural space. What made it possible to study the environmental aspects of addiction at scope of large social groups was using big territorial units (cities and districts) as the object of study and picking a large number of students aged 13 to 17 years. Totally 185000 people were involved. The hypothesis that there exist an interrelation between the predictors of propensity to addiction in students and the socio-economic indicators of municipal territories under study was proved within the frames of this large interdisciplinary study. The key results at the level of municipalities are: the level of wages is related with the propensity to addiction (r = 0.44); with antisocial trends (r = 0.45), with risky behavior (r = 0.37) and with problems in child-parent relationships (r = -0.33). The unemployment rate is connected with the refusal to seek social support (r = -0.34), problems in child-parental relations (r = -0.35, p <0.05). The interrelation of socio-psychological and socio-economic predictors of addiction is established empirically. The obtained results contribute to the objective understanding of data on impact of socio-economic conditions on the level of propensity to addictions in youth environment.
