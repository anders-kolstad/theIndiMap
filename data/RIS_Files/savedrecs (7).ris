AB  - Diversity and composition of the intertidal brachyuran crab community in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Java, Indonesia, during the dry season of 2005 and the rainy season of 2006, shows that crab community composition and structure alone appeared to be poor indicators for the state of a forest in terms of tree diversity and wood-cutting intensity. The lagoon is surrounded by the largest mangrove stand in Java and is under constant anthropogenic pressure, mainly due to logging, land conversion for agriculture, overfishing and industrial pollution. This study aims to determine the crab community composition at different sites of the lagoon in relation to vegetation composition and sediment parameters. In addition it investigates if mangrove crabs can be used as bioindicators to describe the environmental state of mangrove forests (tree diversity, degree of logging). It was assumed to find a low crab diversity and species richness and a strong dominance of a single species at highly disturbed forest sites compared to moderately disturbed sites. A stratified, hierarchical design was used to sample the crab fauna at 13 stations distributed over the entire lagoon. Additionally, abiotic parameters and vegetation composition were recorded. In total 6463 crabs were caught belonging to 49 species, 5 super-families and 10 families, with Ocypodidae and Sesarmidae being the families of most note. Mean density of adult crabs was 27.7 individuals*m(-2) and mean biomass was 12.8 g wet mass*m(-2) or 1.3 g ash free dry mass*m-2. Density and biomass varied strongly within and between stations but they where within the range reported for other mangrove forests of the Indo-West-Pacific. Species composition was significantly different between stations. The distribution of facultatively leaf-feeding grapsid crabs was related to vegetation parameters (tree, seedling and undergrowth density), but the occurrence of single crab and tree species was not correlated. The distribution of ocypodid crabs, feeding on detritus and micro-phytobenthos, correlated with sediment characteristics like median grain size and organic content. The crab community was strongly dominated by one species at six stations, however, this was not correlated to the degree of logging. Leaf-feeding crab and mangrove tree diversity was correlated at areas of one hectare (stations), but not at a lower spatial scale (areas of 100 m(2), "zone"). Species richness of leaf-feeding crabs was not linked to forest diversity. Hence a functional relation between leaf-feeding crab and tree species diversity could not be proven. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forests cannot be managed sustainably without reliable data to inform decisions. National Forest Inventories (NFI) tend to report national statistics, with sub-national stratification based on domestic ecological classification systems. It is becoming increasingly important to be able to report statistics on ecosystems that span international borders, as global change and globalization expand stakeholders' spheres of concern. The state of a transnational ecosystem can only be properly assessed by examining the entire ecosystem. In global forest resource assessments, it may be useful to break national statistics down by ecosystem, especially for large countries. The Inventory and Monitoring Working Group (IMWG) of the North American Forest Commission (NAFC) has begun developing a harmonized North American Forest Database (NAFD) for managing forest inventory data, enabling consistent, continental-scale forest assessment supporting ecosystem-level reporting and relational queries. The first iteration of the database contains data describing 1.9 billion ha, including 677.5 million ha of forest. Data harmonization is made challenging by the existence of definitions and methodologies tailored to suit national circumstances, emerging from each country's professional forestry development. This paper reports the methods used to synchronize three national forest inventories, starting with a small suite of variables and attributes.

AB  - Panzhihua City, a typical eco-fragile region for agro-sylvo-pastoral industry in China, is located in the dry-hot valley of the Jinsha River, characterized by its big landform undulation, great elevation difference, uneven hydrothermal conditions, and complex geological structure. As a crucial ecological barrier in upper reaches of the Yangtze River, this area is abundant in water resources and mineral resources, such as vanadium and titanium. However, due to its over-development for nonnatural urban economy in the mining industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, ecological problems are getting worse. Such problems as soil erosion and groundwater pollution have led obvious ecological degeneration in Panzhihua city. Therefore, for protecting the eco-environment and planning construction, it is significant to scientifically recognize that how eco-environment changes based on spatial-temporal, and how the driving mechanism affects Panzhihua city. Nowadays, there are some theories and methods that study eco-environmental protection and city construction in Panzhihua, but they are not comprehensive enough to study its spatial-temporal evolution and driving-force system. This study takes Panzhihua City as the research area of which evaluation factors, for example, topography, soil, vegetation, and meteorological factors, are chosen to construct an evaluation system suitable for the ecological environment vulnerability of Panzhihua City. These factors are selected in three aspects, which are ecological sensitivity, ecological recovery, and ecological pressure from 2005 to 2015 in this area. Then, spatial principal component analysis method, CA-Markov model, and dynamic degree model are applied to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution for ecological vulnerability based on three periods from 2005 to 2015 in Panzhihua City. Besides, GeoDetector is used to quantitatively analyze how spatial-temporal disparities change and what drives them to change. The results show that (1) during these 10 years, the overall ecological fragility of Panzhihua City is steadily increasing from northwest to southeast. The overall ecological quality is moderate, and regional differences are obvious. Places of moderate vulnerability or above are distributed in central and eastern regions of frequent human activities; places of mild vulnerability or below are distributed in the regions of Yanbian County and Miyi County. (2) The comparison of the changing rates based on vulnerability levels is severe > potential > moderate > mild > slight. The overall vulnerability changes within a small trend, showing a balanced two-way transition state between adjacent vulnerability levels. The comprehensive index for overall ecological vulnerability decreases period by period. (3) The interactions between each two factors toward spatial differentiation and explanatory power by ecological vulnerability show a two-factor-enhanced relation, indicating that multiple factors form the ecological vulnerability of Panzhihua City.

AB  - The main aim of the present study is to give a picture of BP environmental reporting within the period of eleven years (2006 to 2016), as well as examines the effect of the Deepwater Horizon Incident on BP environmental reporting, mainly for the test of applicability of the theory of legitimacy. As found in literature, content analysis procedures arc employed to measure environmental reporting level every year via determining the level of voluntary corporate environmental disclosure that is stated in the annual as well as suitability report through Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) indicator. As such, the results of the present study indicate average in term of BP environmental reporting level. However, in response to the 2010 Gulf Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster, the BP has high the environmental reporting, thus can be explained using legitimacy theory. More so, with regards to employing a longitudinal approach in carrying out research in the oil and gas industry, the present study appears to be the first. Hence, it is expected that the present finding will be generally used to further improve the environmental reporting in BP, as well as other oil and gas companies.

AB  - Effective extension of soil research builds landholder capacity to manage soils productively and sustainably. Government-funded extension programmes also aim to improve the state of the environment through efficient use of resources and mitigating or preventing further land degradation. To these ends, a soil extension programme aimed at farmers in south-eastern Australia was conducted during 2005-2008. The programme was designed to equip landholders with the knowledge, skills and confidence to diagnose and address soil constraints, as well as compile spatial information on soil properties. The programme involved four workshops that covered agricultural productivity, soil management and potential off-site impacts. Workshops were held on-farm and involved discussion, theory supported with practical exercises, and field visits. More than 1,400 participants were provided with subsidized soil tests to encourage soil monitoring and underpin the workshop theory on land capability and soil constraints (e.g., soil acidity, sodicity, salinity, nutrient decline and toxicities). Prior to the course, most participants did not regularly soil test so training on monitoring protocols was provided. The soil data indicated considerable phosphorus deficiencies, low organic carbon levels, and acidity across both cropping and pasture systems. Participant knowledge and land management intentions were tracked throughout the workshop series using surveys. The surveys identified a positive shift in the knowledge, understanding and confidence of most participants. However, a follow-up survey 10 years later indicated that these changes may not have been broadly sustained. Based on our study, we recommend continued engagement of landholders along a learning pathway to maximize investment in soil extension.

AB  - An attempt to offer a methodology for analyzing the business environment as in a global context (of the world) as in regional level (of Ukraine), which would come from an empirical base provided by domestic world analytical organizations of the public and private sectors of the economy was made. Methodology. As part of the methodology of assessment of the level of development of the world business environment, the author conducted a preliminary analysis of twenty-five indices examined their constituents in order to avoid duplication of index components which would lead to a distortion of research results. As part of the regional methodology, an 8-stage algorithm was proposed for assessing the level of development of the business environment of the regions of Ukraine based on 40 selected and reasonable indicators that cover 7 main areas and reflect various aspects of the business environment. Results. Nine proposed indices that are in complex, its component composition, are not overlapping and complementary, so reflect and provide a quantitative description of each of the multiple facets of this phenomenon as the world business environment. An integral estimation of the business environment of Ukraine in a regional context has been carried out; an integral index of the level of development of the business environment of a region has been calculated; both of them can act as the objective quantitative criteria for the formation of regional clusters. Objective characteristics of the business climate of a certain territory (in our case, region or group of regions) are obtained. Practical implications. Following the proposed method, the analysis of the level of development of the business environment of 70 countries in the classification limits introduced by the author in previous studies (European, North American, Latin American, African, Far Eastern, Islamic, Indian, ocean), in order to further clustering and graphical interpretation of the results. The group of leaders is formed by countries that relate to different models of the business environment. The countries of the European model are Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria. North American model: Canada and the United States of America. Representative of the Far Eastern model is Japan, as well as Australia which belongs to other models. The group of outsiders include countries that have a poor integrated index of business environment development, they are representatives of the African (Angola, Congo, Chad), Islamic (Syria, Somalia, Sudan) and Island (Polynesia) models. The results of analyzing of the business environment of the regions of Ukraine show that in 2017 Lviv, Kyiv region became a cluster of high development. The index of development the business environment, calculated by us, proves the extremely expressed polarization and unevenness of the processes of development of territories. Value/originality. The results obtained with graphical and formulaic interpretation make it possible to understand the condition, problems, prospects of their overcoming, to outline directions of further development and opportunities to support the business environment in the regional and global context.

AB  - Rangeland ecosystems are capable of providing an array of ecosystem services important to the wellbeing of society. Some of these services (e. g. meat, fibre) are transported to markets and their quantity, quality and value are established via a set of widely accepted standards. Other services (e. g. climate mitigation, water quality, wildlife habitat) do not leave the land, but are, in fact, most valuable when they remain in situ. Determining their quantity, quality and value presents a challenge that must be met if there is to be a credible, accessible ecosystem services market for rangelands. In this paper we describe some of the ecosystem services that may be extracted from rangelands, discuss their unique ecological nature and relate those unique ecological properties to soil and vegetation attributes that can serve as a basis for measurement, both quality and quantity. We suggest the use of a soil/vegetation-based system in which similar climate, geomorphology and edaphic properties are grouped into ecological sites based on their response to disturbance. Within each ecological site, a unique state and transition model describes the dynamics of vegetation and soil surface properties, provides state indicators (vegetation structure, soil properties), predicts ecosystem services that may be derived at multiple scales, and organises information related to management to achieve ecosystem service objectives, including sustainability.

AB  - The United States like every other country across the globe, especially the developed nations, have consistently battled one of man's greatest challenge of the 21st century-saving and sustaining the dire environment. Being the largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) after China, the United States is increasingly faced with an urgent policy drive toward environmental sustainability. Against the backdrop, this study employed the dynamic ARDL-bound testing approach to observing the tripartite impact of the trade policy, monetary policy, and migration index on carbon emissions over the period 1990:Q1-2018: Q2. The incorporated renewable energy consumption and the real GDP which controls for other unobserved factors arc observed to have similar and significant impacts as in previous studies. The current study found that the trade policy, monetary policy, and migration index exerts positive and significant impacts on carbon dioxide emissions in the long-am. It implies that. in the near future, the environmental sustainability of the United Rain is at the risk of the government policies on trade, monetary, and migration. However, such impact. of the migration index on the carbon dioxide emissions is barely significant. in the long-run and at the immediate time. Although the impact of the government's trade policy on carbon dioxide emissions is significant in the long-run, it immediate impact is negative and not significant. Hence, policy frameworks of the government should be designed such that it meets the Sustainable Development Goals 2030. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three Florida native larval butterflies (Junonia coenia, Anartia jatrophae, Eumaeus atala) were used in the present study to determine the acute toxicity, hazard, and risk of a 24 h ingestion of leaves contaminated with the adult mosquito control insecticides permethrin, naled, and dichlorvos to late 4th and early 5th in-star caterpillars. Based on 24-h LD50s for ingestion, naled was more acutely toxic than permethrin and dichlorvos to caterpillars. Hazard quotients using the ratio of the highest doses and the 90th percentile doses from field measurements in host plant foliage following actual mosquito control applications to the toxicological benchmarks from laboratory toxicity tests indicate potential high acute hazard for naled compared to permethrin and dichlorvos. Based on probabilistic ecological risk methods, naled exposure doses in the environment also presented a higher acute risk to caterpillars than permethrin and dichlorvos. The acute toxicity laboratory results and ecological risk assessment are based only on dietary ingestion and single chemical doses. It does not include other typical exposure scenarios that may occur in the environment. It is thus plausible to state that the ecological risk assessment presented here underestimates the potential risks in the field to caterpillars. However, one assumption that is scientifically feasible and certainly real from the results - if the environmental exposure doses of mosquito control operations are similar or higher to those presented here in leaves from the field, after applications, there will likely be significant mortalities and other adverse effects on caterpillar populations.

AB  - Environmental flows are an integral component for the conservation and management of rivers, flood plains and other wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin. Under the Basin Plan, environmental water is managed by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office (CEWO) and the states. We assessed CEWO environmental flows (2014-15 to 2018-19), compared our findings with expected outcomes for vegetation in the Basin-wide Environmental Watering Strategy (EWS) and interviewed water managers about the efficacy of environmental watering. Some 21% of CEWO water was delivered as flood events, to 9 of 19 river valleys, inundating 7% of wetland area in those valleys annually and 0.8% of major Basin wetlands. A consistent pattern was the watering of many small wetlands on the South Australian Murray with small volumes (median area 43 ha, volume 125 ML). Just 12% of the area of river red gum subject to EWS expected outcomes was flooded, and half these events were likely suboptimal to achieve ecological benefits. Wetlands have not received the water they need and vegetation outcomes cannot be met by completion of the Plan in 2024. Rules that constrain flooding of private land must be relaxed if the Plan is to achieve its statutory requirement of wetland conservation.

AB  - An ongoing study initiated in August 1990 investigated the effects of disturbances (organic mulching, cultivation, herbicides) on the detritus food-web in annual (maize) and perennial (asparagus) cropping systems. In this paper we attempt to simultaneously assess the functional and taxonomic structure of various components of this food-web. Biota in the perennial system was the most responsive to disturbance. The microflora was strongly influenced by mulching, and through tritrophic effects caused increases in top predatory but not most microbe-feeding nematodes. These effects have become increasingly apparent as the study has progressed and, in the asparagus site, have worked their way down the soil profile over time. Cultivation in the asparagus site caused large increases in bacterial-feeding nematodes, probably due to the high weed levels which developed during the winter months under that treatment. Evidence appears to exist for a cascade effect operating due to top down effects of nematodes on lower trophic levels. Ordination analysis of the nematode data demonstrated that nematode populations were more closely related to the state of environmental factors at earlier samplings than at contemporary samplings, and that the linkages between the nematode and environmental data sets strengthened over time. For both the nematode and soil-associated beetle data distinct assemblages of organisms were found in the mulched plots; distinct assemblages of nematode genera also emerged in the cultivated asparagus plots after two years. The soil-associated macrofauna was usually linked to high weed and surface organic residue levels. Species diversity of soil associated nematodes was not particularly responsive to disturbance while that of the soil-associated beetles was strongly enhanced by mulching and (sometimes) high weed levels. Approaches based on either functional group or species composition data emerged in our study as reasonably sensitive indicators for assessing the response of the soil biota to disturbance.

AB  - The Amazon forest in the state of Maranhao ensures ecosystem services that directly and indirectly affect the life quality of its population and economy, via hydrologic and climatic regulation, among other benefits. Currently, only 25% of the original forest cover (24.7 thousand km(2)) remains while illegal deforestation persists in a violent process that provokes visible social, economic and environmental harm. Simultaneously, Maranhao has seen record levels of burning, faces a water shortage and fights against the worst social and economic indicators in the country. Conversely, secondary vegetation covers 19.9 thousand km(2) (27% of deforested area) and is completely unprotected. Contrary to the international commitments assumed by Brazil to combat deforestation and restore forests, some of the political representatives of Maranhao have sought legal mechanisms to further diminish forest cover in public and private areas. To promote the conservation and restoration of Maranhao Amazon Forest, a multi-institutional network of researchers was established in 2015. This viewpoint paper aims to draw attention to this endangered region of the Brazilian Amazon and give science-oriented recommendations to policy makers in order to avoid more setbacks. We argue that Maranhao state must urgently establish a policy of Zero Deforestatidn, protect secondary forests and comply with the national forest restoration policy, thus ensuring long-term economic sustainability.

AB  - Diatom indices have been used and tested mainly for assessing the ecological status of rivers and deep lakes, but there are scarce studies that determine their effectiveness in shallow lakes and in coastal Mediterranean lakes. This study evaluates the validity of several common diatom indices (SPI, BDI, CEC and TDIL) for the determination of the ecological quality of three coastal lakes (Valencia, Spain) and presents descriptions and ecological data of the main diatom species recorded. Diatom samples were collected from phytobenthos, both from epiphyton of the dominant submerged macrophytes and the sediment. The ecological status of the systems was determined according to different physico-chemical variables and was compared with the results obtained from epiphytic diatom communities. The results showed discrepancies among diatom indices and also with the state determined by the environmental variables. The effectiveness of the indices depended on the number of species assessed for each index with respect to the total species recorded and the suitability of the weight assigned to each species. The results reveal the need to gather more information about the composition and ecology of the diatoms and microalgae characteristic of coastal Mediterranean standing waters. This work contributes to their better knowledge.

AB  - Several indicators have been suggested in the field of landscape protection. However, is there a need to operationalise such indicators. According to the [Environmental Indicators for Agriculture, vol. 3, Methods and Results, OECD, Paris, 2001, p. 368] the structural indicator 'man-made objects' is illustrated by a method that includes the analysis of parameters for the operationalisation of the indicator. The method also includes a geographical information system (GIS)-aided spatial integration of landscape element distribution and surrounding land use types, for building the so-called landscape complexes (LCs). An LC is used to characterise natural units (a type of landscape-oriented classification of the entire test area), with regard to their landscape type qualities.
   Carrying out this so-called operationalisation can assist in a more specific and improved region-oriented structuring (regionalisation) of agri-environmental programmes, which are currently negligibly space- and target-oriented.
   The investigation area was the entire area of the German federal state Baden-Wuerttemberg, as well as single natural units comprising the state. The operationalisation method was firstly aimed at setting priorities for landscape protection on the spatial level of the state, which has the political and administrative power to enforce them. Secondly the method assisted in the identification of special packets of target-oriented measures, which can be used on the level of natural units. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most of the water quality models previously developed and used in dissolved oxygen (DO) prediction are complex. Moreover, reliable data available to develop/calibrate new DO models is scarce. Therefore, there is a need to study and develop models that can handle easily measurable parameters of a particular site, even with short length. In recent decades, computational intelligence techniques, as effective approaches for predicting complicated and significant indicator of the state of aquatic ecosystems such as DO, have created a great change in predictions. In this study, three different AI methods comprising: (1) two types of artificial neural networks (ANN) namely multi linear perceptron (MLP) and radial based function (RBF); (2) an advancement of genetic programming namely linear genetic programming (LGP); and (3) a support vector machine (SVM) technique were used for DO prediction in Delaware River located at Trenton, USA. For evaluating the performance of the proposed models, root mean square error (RMSE), Nashe-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), mean absolute relative error (MARE) and, correlation coefficient statistics (R) were used to choose the best predictive model. The comparison of estimation accuracies of various intelligence models illustrated that the SVM was able to develop the most accurate model in DO estimation in comparison to other models. Also, it was found that the LGP model performs better than the both ANNs models. For example, the determination coefficient was 0.99 for the best SVM model, while it was 0.96, 0.91 and 0.81 for the best LGP, MLP and RBF models, respectively. In general, the results indicated that an SVM model could be employed satisfactorily in DO estimation. (C) 2016, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

AB  - This paper analyzes the state of the environment in the City of Novi Sad, as the representative of a typical central European city by its architectural heritage. The impact of traffic on urban environment of Novi Sad has been examined and presented through a state of air quality, noise pollution and frequency of passenger and freight vehicles in the period from 2006 to 2008. The following indicators of air quality have been measured: total amount of sediments in air, sulphur dioxide, soot, NO2, CO, CO2, total quantity of suspended particles, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), benzene, and ground-level ozone. The parameters whose maximum annual values are constantly exceeding the legally permitted limits are the following: total amount of sediments in the air, soot, total amount of suspended particles and BaP as a representative of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The tree-year monitoring of the noise levels indicates the exceeding of permitted daily and nightly noise levels as well as their annual growth. Moreover, the obtained results about the average 15-minute frequency of passenger and freight vehicles in traffic also indicate an obvious growth trend. In addition, this paper brings forth one of the possible solutions for solving mentioned problems proposing the cycling as a sustainable alternative for commuting. Furthermore, it presents the research conducted in the form of a survey on cycling as a way of transportation among the students of the University of Novi Sad. Finally, the last part of the paper presents the newly built bicycle parking which has proven to be a good investment and a template for other educational institutions and companies with a large number of employees as well as ideal solution applicable in solving the great part of problems of air pollution, noise, congestion, land consumption and time for reaching the destination.

AB  - Assessing the size structure and composition of fish stocks, as demanded by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), is considered to be critical for the evaluation of the health status of exploited populations. The MSFD explicitly contains the concept that many large individuals within a population are indicative of a healthy stock. To reflect the abundance of large individuals, the EU-Commission suggested several size-based indicators (SBI). Only few of these SBI have been tested within a pressure-state relationship, in which a state indicator is sensitive, responsive and specific to a given pressure. Sensitivity and responsiveness of pressure-state relationship can be validated by cross-correlating time-series of pressure and state indicators. In the real world, however, time-series of ecological indicators are not only affected by the influence of a pressure, but by natural variability, changes in the sampling method and stochasticity. Hence observed cross-correlations between pressure and state indicator time-series may not be based on a true causal link, especially if time-series are short (less than 30 years). To overcome these limitations, the performance of eight SBI was tested with a population model in which pressures (fishing mortality) and states of ecosystem components (SBI) were precisely known. We distinguished between relative SBI reflecting proportions of size-classes and absolute SBI reflecting absolute entities of the size-distribution such as the observed maximum size in a given survey year. Relative SBI were more sensitive to recruitment than absolute SBI. but not to fishing pressure, which makes relative SBI unsuitable for the assessment of the abundance of large individuals within a population. The outcomes of the model simulation were confirmed by a case study on North Sea cod, where the mean length of the largest ten individuals caught in a given survey year (L-max10) emerged as a promising indicator for the assessment of size structure. Exemplary, we demonstrate how the L-max10 may be incorporated into the existing International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) assessment framework by defining target and limit values of the good environmental status.

AB  - Many administrative jurisdictions have authority over parts of the Great Lakes, sometimes with competing purposes as well as governance at differing scales of time and space. As demand increases for high quality information that is relevant to environmental managers, environmental and natural resource agencies with limited budgets must look to interdisciplinary, collaborative approaches for the collection, analysis and reporting of data. The State of the Lakes Ecosystem Conferences (SOLEC) were begun in 1994 in response to reporting requirements of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the U. S. The biennial conferences provide independent, science-based reporting on the state of health of the Great Lakes ecosystem components. A suite of indicators necessary and sufficient to assess Great Lakes ecosystem status was introduced in 1998, and assessments based on a subset of the indicators were presented in 2000. Because SOLEC is a multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional reporting venue, the SOLEC indicators require acceptance by a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the Great Lakes basin. The SOLEC indicators list is expected to provide the basis for government agencies and other organizations to collaborate more effectively and to allocate resources to data collection, evaluation and reporting on the state of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem.

AB  - Saving the remaining natural forests in northern Europe has been one of the main goals to halt the ongoing decline of forest biodiversity. To facilitate the recognition, mapping and efficient conservation of natural forests, there is an urgent need for a general formulation, based on ecological patterns and processes, of the concept of "forest naturalness". However, complexity, structural idiosyncracy and dynamical features of unmanaged forest ecosystems at various spatio-temporal scales pose major challenges for such a formulation. The definitions hitherto used for the concept of forest naturalness can be fruitfully grouped into three dimensions: 1) structure-based concepts of natural forest, 2) species-based concepts of natural forest and 3) process-based concepts of natural forest. We propose that explicit and simultaneous consideration of all these three dimensions of naturalness can better cope with the natural variability of forest states and also aid in developing strategies for forest conservation and management in different situations. To become operational, criteria and indicators of forest naturalness need to integrate the three dimensions by combining species (e.g. red-listed-, indicator- and umbrella species) with stand and landscape level structural features that are indicative of disturbance and succession processes.

AB  - The notion of naturalness is an important concept of forest sustainable management, biological conservation, or as a base for restoration projects. The naturalness degree of a forest system is commonly evaluated based on forest ecology indicators, primarily with a relative short time resolution (e.g. dendroecological indication). However, the current state of ecological systems is the result of processes occurring in interaction at different and hierarchically connected spatial and temporal scales, including long term resolution (e.g. Holocene scale). Consequently, to assess the naturalness degree of ecological systems it is important to deal with their various temporal and spatial scales. In order to do that, palaeoecological approaches are needed, but hitherto have rarely been applied in naturalness investigations. The difficulties of interpretation in terms of spatial resolution of the main used palaeoecological approaches (e.g. palynology) and the presence of archive sites favourable to provide palaeoecological proxies seem to be limiting factors. Pedoanthracology allows the investigation of forest dynamics at the local spatial scale potentially everywhere, and for a longer time resolution. This paper illustrates this by using pedoanthracology to contribute to the naturalness assessment of three study cases in various biomes in Europe, in the south French Alps, in Central Germany and in Northern Germany. The charcoal richness of soil samples was quantified, and fragments were analysed taxonomically. Radiocarbon dating of single charcoals, combined with soil description, allows interpretation of the data within a temporal and spatial framework.
   At the site in Northern Germany, the ancient occurrence of fire was identified, burning early Holocene pioneer forest vegetation, while during more recent times, the burning of Fagus forest happened, Fagus sylvatica being today's dominant forest tree. At the site south of the Harz Mountains, in Central Germany, the established reference system is a Quercus dominated forest, which has persisted for thousands of years until today, possibly due to human woodland management. At the third site, in the French Southern Alps, the local forest system has never been more mature than in the current state, because it was regularly renewed by fire disturbances.

AB  - Hierarchical clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique that is used to discover potential relationships in data sets. Despite the conciseness and interpretability, hierarchical clustering algorithms still face some challenges such as inaccuracy, time-consuming, and difficulty in choosing merging strategies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Clustering algorithm with a Merging strategy based on Shared Subordinates (HCMSS), which defines new concepts of the local core representative and the shared subordinate belonging to multiple representatives. First, the state-of-the-art natural neighbor (NaN) is introduced to compute the local neighborhood and the local density of each data point. Next, a sharing-based local core searching algorithm (SLORE) is proposed to find local core points and divide the input data set into numerous initial small clusters. Lastly, these small clusters are merged hierarchically and form the final clustering result. We creatively split the merging process into two sub-steps: first, pre-connecting small clusters according to a shared-subordinates-based indicator that measures the stickiness between clusters; second, merging the pre-connected intermediate clusters and the remaining unconnected small clusters in a classical hierarchical way. Experiments on 8 synthetic and 8 real-world data sets demonstrate that HCMSS can effectively improve the clustering accuracy and is less time-consuming than 2 state-of-the-art benchmarks.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate between focalization and universalization on welfare policies as the best way to develop the welfare state in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, there is a need to develop a measure that exhibits the multidimensional nature of the welfare state, instead of focusing on the social spending dimension. Segura-Ubiergo (The political economy of the welfare state in Latin America: globalization, democracy and development. Cambridge University Press, New York, 2007) constructed a welfare effort index (WEI) to facilitate understand the relative degrees of welfare state development among Latin American countries. The WEI focuses mainly on social spending and ignores the other dimensions of welfare. Based on a comparative analysis of 17 Latin American countries and following the methodology of Segura-Ubiergo, a new index that aims at enriching the WEI was constructed. The new index is multidimensional in that it has eight indicators relating to three dimensions of welfare: social spending, coverage of welfare programs and outcome of welfare institutions. Principal component analysis was used for reducing the indicators into three indexes that represent three proposed dimensions of welfare. The combination of these three indexes gives the multidimensional welfare index. The results of the index account for more than 75 % of the data variance.

AB  - Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) are a distinctive feature of low-relief plateaus in eastern Australia and are listed as an endangered ecological community under state and federal policy. A significant proportion of these 'upland swamps' occur within the World Heritage Blue Mountains of NSW. Here, long wall mining, coal seam gas extraction and catchment urbanisation are impacting on the conservation and protection status of these systems. Here we undertake a geomorphic condition assessment of these systems and analyse the range of intrinsic and extrinsic controls operating upon them. Of the 458 sites assessed, 120 (26%) were channelised fills and 338 (74%) were intact swamps. For intact swamps, 49% remain in good geomorphic condition compared to only 28% for channelised systems. Incision of these upland swamps cannot be explained by intrinsic controls such as catchment area, swamp slope, swamp size or shape relations alone. A range of interrelated extrinsic impacts associated with urbanisation are key controls on the condition and sensitivity of these systems. The most significant relationships occur between those swamps in good and moderate condition and percent of impervious area in a swamp catchment (<10% coverage), distance to stormwater pipes and groundwater bores (both <500 m distant), and the extent of stormwater connectivity (contain no stormwater outlets). In general, once the condition of a swamp deteriorates past good or moderate, it is impacted. In a swamp management context, identifying thresholds of concern' and treating extrinsic controls associated with human-disturbance (through either conservation or rehabilitation) has the potential to significantly impact swamp type and condition into the future.

AB  - Freshwater is becoming scarce worldwide with the rapidly growing population, developing industries, burgeoning agriculture, and increasing consumption. Assessment of ecosystem services has been regarded as a promising way to reconcile the increasing demand and depleting natural resources. In this paper, we proposed a multidimensional assessment framework for evaluating water provisioning ecosystem services by integrating multi-source remote sensing products. We applied the multidimensional framework to assess lake water ecosystem services in the state of Minnesota, US. We found that: (1) the water provisioning ecosystem services degraded during 1998-2018 from three assessment perspectives; (2) the output, efficiency, and trend indices have stable distribution and various spatial clustering patterns from 1998 to 2018; (3) high-level efficiency depends on high-level output, and low-level output relates to low-level efficiency; (4) Western Minnesota, including Northwest, West Central, and Southwest, degraded more severely than other zones in water provisioning services; (5) human activities impact water provisioning services in Minnesota more than climate changes. These findings can benefit policymakers by identifying the priorities for better protection, conservation, and restoration of lake ecosystems. Our multidimensional assessment framework can be adapted to evaluate ecosystem services in other regions.

AB  - In Chinese medicine, raw herbal materials are used in processed and unprocessed forms aiming to meet the different requirements of clinical practice. To assure the chemical quality and therapeutic properties of the herbs, fast and integrated systematic assays are required. So far, such assays have not been established. Delayed luminescence (DL) refers to a decaying long-term ultraweak photon emission after exposure to light. Its decay kinetics under certain conditions may be a sensitive indicator reflecting the internal structural and chemical/physiological state of a biological system. DL measurements have been used in many applications for quality control. However, relatively little research has been reported on dried plant material such as Chinese herbs. The objective of the present study is to establish a protocol for direct and rapid DL measurements of dried Chinese herbal materials, including the determination of the dependence on: (a) the optimal excitation time utilizing a white light source; (b) the optimal size of the grinded herbal particle; and (c) the humidity conditions before and during measurement. Results indicate that stable and reproducible curves of DL photon emission depend mainly on the water content of herbal materials. To investigate the application of the established DL measurement protocol, non-processed and processed Aconitum (Aconitum carmichaelii Debx.), wild and cultivated rhubarb (Rheum palmatum L.) and ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Mey) of different ages were measured using DL. The results suggest that DL technology is a potential tool for assessment of dried Chinese herb qualities. The results warrant a further exploration of this technique in relation to therapeutic properties of the herbs. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A multiple analysis of the impact of the endocrine disruptor nonylphenol on the number of microorganisms, taxonomic structure of the microbial community, and phytotoxicity of a loamy soddy-podzolic soil (Eutric Albic Retisol (Abruptic, Loamic, Aric, Ochric)) was performed in model experiments for the first time. The upper horizons of a loamy soddy-podzolic soil from Leningrad oblast were analyzed. The number and group composition of the soil microbiota were determined by the inoculation of soil suspensions on standard nutrient media. The taxonomic composition of the microbial community was studied using the pyrosequencing method (Illumina MiSeq). The content of nonylphenol in soil samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The phytotoxicity of the soil samples was evaluated in relation to the test culture of soft wheat (Triticum aestivum). It was found that nonylphenol induces dose- and time-dependent changes in the number of the main physiological groups of soil microorganisms. In the presence of nonylphenol, a significant increase in the number of heterotrophic and oligotrophic microorganisms, as well as of bacteria tolerant to nonylphenol was observed. Actinomycetes and spore-forming bacteria proved to be most sensitive to this chemical. Under the impact of nonylphenol, the species diversity of the soil microbial cenosis decreased. Proteobacteria became the dominant phylum (78%) in the taxonomic structure of the microbial community. In the soil polluted by nonylphenol, the intensity of microbiological mineralization of nitrogen-containing organic substances decreased, and nitrogen immobilization processes were inhibited. The phytotoxicity of the soil samples with a high dose of nonylphenol (300 mg/kg soil) manifested itself during a month-long incubation. The obtained results can be used in developing a scientifically grounded methodology for bioremediation of soils contaminated with endocrine disruptors. Changes in the phylogenetic structure of soil microbial cenoses can serve as a sensitive bioindicator of the ecological soil state.

AB  - This article reports on the evaluation of existing ecological monitoring variables from a variety of sources to select a suite of core variables suitable for monitoring at the Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN) sites located across Canada. The purpose of EMAN is to promote the acquisition of relevant and consistent data that can be used to report on national trends and provide an early warning of ecosystem change. Existing monitoring variables were evaluated in two steps. In the first step, three primary criteria were used to pre-screen preliminary variables. In the second step, a more detailed evaluation considered twenty criteria based on data quality, applicability, data collection methods, data analysis and interpretation, existing data and programs, and cost effectiveness to select a draft set of core monitoring variables (CMV). An ecological framework was developed to organize the CMV in a manner that permitted a gap analysis to confirm the CMV assessed a wide range of relevant environment components. The suite of CMV were then tested to determine their effectiveness in detecting ecosystem change caused by stressors with ecosystem responses that have been well documented in the literature. This project is part of a process lead by Environment Canada to select CMV to detect and track ecosystem change at EMAN sites. It is anticipated that the proposed CMV will undergo future discussion and development leading to the final selection of a suite of CMV for use at EMAN sites.

AB  - The introduction of an integration approach for management of the water basins, including assessment and control of stream water quality and sediment qualify, as well as regulation of the pollutant influx in the water receiver, is necessary. The changes in the microbial communities, as a response to the chronic discharge of untreated dairy wastewater: were followed in river and in depth, in three river components "stream water - sediment water - sediments". The water quality of Leva River decreased after diary wastewater discharge as the microbial communities reacted with structural and functional changes, related with of aerobic heterotrophs and the values of total dehydrogenase activity and phosphatase activity index. The result was a decrease of organic matter and nutrients in the stream water in Station 4. However, an improvement Of river water quality was not ascertained according to the Bulgarian State Standard. The applied ecological theory for r/K- strategists showed that in the stream water the microbial community is presented with fast growing populations, while in the sediment water and sediments prevailed slow growing bacteria. In the sediments aerobic heterotrophs were with higher density and showed higher activities of total de-hydrogenase, phosphatase and protease. The obtained results confirmed that microbial community in the sediment zone is an important factor for the regulation of the transformation processes of organic matter and nutrients in water and sediments, as well as for the formation of river water quality in water receiver.

AB  - Sustainable water use implies the simultaneous protection of water quality and quantity. Beyond their function to support human needs such as drinking water provision, transportation and recreation freshwater bodies are also habitats. Conceiving them as water users on their own with respective biological, physico-chemical and morphological requirements could help maintaining their healthy state. Healthy freshwater ecosystems are also attractive for high-value human uses. Dwindling per capita availability of water, increasing demands, human well-being and climate change lead to competition for, and pressures on freshwater ecosystems. This has been conceptualized through the modification of the drivers-pressures-state-impacts-responses framework. This distinguishes between pressures, associated with the achievement of human well-being, and stressors, which are defined as the negative effect of excessive pressures or combination thereof on aquatic ecosystems. Guidelines usually specify threshold values to classify water bodies as appropriate for certain utilitarian uses. However, only few guidelines focus on freshwater ecosystem health. Eight guidelines for monitoring of freshwater ecosystem health were analysed in the UNEP-funded project "International Water Quality Guidelines for Ecosystems". Based on this review, general benchmark values are proposed for key physico-chemical indicators. Furthermore, adaptive pathways towards improved monitoring and protection of the health of freshwater ecosystems are recommended. In this paper, we review the main findings of the report and also review its recent uptake. Water quality guidelines for freshwater ecosystems cannot be conceived without societal consensus and vision. Different climatic, geographical and socioeconomic contexts are to be considered too. Their development is embedded in an adaptive cycle. Its multiple phases and steps indicate a long-term approach including reassessment and potential revisions.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to identify a set of crucial indicators to assess the most pressing environmental impacts of diets.
   Based on a literature review, 55 potential assessment methods were selected and their distinctive indicators identified. The methods were classified according to their position in the DPSIR framework [chain of Drivers, Pressures, State (changes), Impacts, and Responses], and into 15 environmental issues at three levels. The selection was narrowed down to eight, based on the availability of reliable methods, their relevance to agri-food systems, their frequent application for diets, and their recommendation by international bodies.
   (1) At the global (supra) level, the planetary boundaries approach addresses the current global environmental (change in) state and helps to prioritize the most pressing issues related to the agri-food system as a driver. These issues are climate change, nitrogen and phosphorus cycle disruption, land-use change, and freshwater use. (2) At the national (macro) level, the footprints approach is used to identify indicators. This footprint family includes ecological, land, carbon, energy, and water footprints. International bodies support these key indicators, but they recommend complementary assessment methods for nitrogen and phosphorus flows, soil health, and pesticide use. (3) At the product (micro) level, life cycle assessment includes 11 pressure indicators. Of the latter, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) and land use (LU) are the most frequently used indicators in diet studies.
   We conclude that GHGEs and LU fulfill the selection criteria and address most of the environmental impact of diets well. In the future, these indicators should be supplemented with an indicator addressing the nitrogen and phosphorous efficiency of food products.

AB  - This experiment compared physiological and productive responses in finishing beef cattle managed under heat stress conditions, and supplemented (SUPP) or not (CON) with an immunomodulatory feed ingredient (Omnigen-AF; Phibro Animal Health, Teaneck, NJ). Crossbred yearling cattle (3/4 Bos taunts a 1/4 Bos indicus; 64 heifers and 64 steers) were ranked by initial body weight (BW) (440 3 kg) and sex, and allocated to 1 of 16 unshaded drylot pens (8 heifers or steers/pen). Pens within sex were randomly assigned to receive SUPP or CON (n = 8/treatment). Cattle received a total-mixed ration (91% concentrate inclusion and 1.21 Mcal/kg of net energy for gain; dry matter [DM basis]) during the experiment (day 0 to 106). The immunomodulatory feed was offered as a top-dress to SUPP pens (56 g/d per animal; as -fed basis) beginning on day 7. Cattle BW were recorded on day 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, and 106. Feed intake was evaluated from each pen by recording feed offer daily and refusals biweekly. Intravaginal temperature of heifers was recorded hourly from day 1 to 6, 29 to 41, and 85 to 97. Environmental temperature humidity index (THI) was also recorded hourly throughout the experiment, and averaged 79.8 0.6. Concurrently with BW assessment, hair samples from the tail-switch were collected (3 animals/pen) for analysis of hair cortisol concentrations. Blood samples were collected on day 0, 28, 56, 84, and 106 from all animals for plasma extraction. Whole blood was collected on day 0, 56, and 106 (3 animals/pen) for analysis of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and HSP72 mRNA expression. Cattle were slaughtered on day 107 at a commercial packing facility. Results obtained prior to day 7 served as independent covariate for each respective analysis. Heifers receiving SUPP had less (P 0.05) vaginal temperature from 1500 to 1900 h across sampling days (treatment a hour, P < 0.01; 39.05 vs. 39.19 degrees C, respectively; SEM = 0.04), when THI ranged from 85.3 to 90.1. Expression of HSP70 and HSP72 was less (P >= 0.03) for SUPP cattle on day 106 (22.6- vs. 51.5 -fold effect for HSP70, SEM = 9.7, and 11.0- vs. 32.8 -fold effect for HSP72; treatment X day, P <= 0.04). No treatment effects were detected (P >= 0.22) for performance, carcass traits, plasma concentrations of cortisol and haptoglobin, or hair cortisol concentrations. Results from this study suggest that SUPP ameliorated hyperthermia in finishing cattle exposed to heat stress conditions, but such benefit was not sufficient to improve productive responses.

AB  - In Mixed Rainy Forest, natural regeneration is not studied very well. In Rio Grande do Sul, due to anthropic actions, it IS under different alteration conditions, in some cases, forming fragments. This study aimed to analyze the floristic of natural regeneration and to verify the Occurrence of floristic groups]it the area where no pronounced alterations were found. The area with 1606,69 ha was located Lit Sao Francisco de Paula National Forest (among 29 degrees 23' and 29 degrees 27 ' S; 50 degrees 23' and 50 degrees 25 ' W), displayed in 1.606,69 ha, in Sao Francisco de Paula municipal county, RS. In the study, 6 permanent growing stands of PELD (Long Duration Ecological Project) were selected, the vegetation was inventoried, using 10 parallel strips to each other and perpendicular to the direction of the topographical position, which presented 10 m of width and 100 m of length, subdivided into 10 units of 100 m(2), totalizing 1 ha, where were raffled 3 sample units for strip to identify and measure (height and circumference) the individuals with Cap higher or equal to 3 cm and smaller than 30 cm. The lianas, creepers and herbs also had their circumferences measured and identified up to the species level, when possible. The density data for species formed a matrix (18000) used in the multivarlate analysis. The presence of vegetation grouping in state of natural regeneration inside the forest was tested by TWINSPAN Method (Two-way indicator species analysis). The existence of three ecological groups (G-1, G-2 and G-3) was proved. G-1 was characterized by good water availability and for having intermediate environmental characteristics, for locating in the topographical position regarding the medium hillside. G-2 occurred in the base hillside of the forest, presenting strong influence of the hydric saturation and subjected to sporadic overflow; and, in G-3, in the topographical position of the hillside higher/plateau that consequently doesn't suffer influence of the elevation of hydric saturation. The indicative species of the groups were: Sebastiania brasiliensis Spreng. (G-1); Matayba elaeagnoides Radek., Myrceugenia myrcioides Cambess O. Berg, Myrceugenia oxysepala (Burret) D. Legrand et Kausel and Cinnamomum glaziovii (Mez) Kosterm.(G-2); and Zanthoxylum petiolare A. St.-Hil & Tul. (G-3).

AB  - Because eutrophication constitutes a key problem in limnology, evaluation of trophic state is a preliminary and essential step for the conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. Frequently, lake trophic state is expressed by using parameters measured in the water column such as water transparency, total phosphorus or chlorophyll-a concentrations. The application of these indices usually requires repeated seasonal monitoring of the system for obtaining the annual mean values. Considering that lake sediments reflect lake trophic state, in this work we show the relevance of using sediment composition (total N and organic matter content) for obtaining quantitative data related to lake trophic state (bio-production number, BPN). Our results show that the estimated values obtained with BPN (ranging from 5.23 to 6.33), in a lake with relatively low organic matter content, reflected the trophic state as estimated by traditional water-column methods. Furthermore, the reproducibility of the BPN method, which is reflected by the constant BPN values along time, means that only one sampling including the spatial heterogeneity of the surface sediment, can provide a reasonable composite measure of trophic condition in a wetland. Finally, and as it represents a less time-consuming index, we propose the BPN as an appropriate trophic state indicator for wetlands, shallow lakes, and aquatic systems showing large temporal variability.

AB  - Phyllosilicates are classified into the following groups: 1 - Neutral 1:1 structures: the kaolinite and serpentine group. 2 - Neutral 2:1 structures: the pyrophyllite and talc group. 3 - High-charge 2:1 structures, non-expansible in polar liquids: illite and the dioctahedral and trioctahedral micas, also brittle micas. 4 - Low- to medium-charge 2:1 structures, expansible phyllosilicates in polar liquids: smectites and vermiculites. 5 - Neutral 2:1:1 structures: chlorites. 6 - Neutral to weak-charge ribbon structures, so-called pseudophyllosilicates or hormites: palygorskite and sepiolite (fibrous crystalline clay minerals). 7 - Amorphous clay minerals. Order-disorder states, polymorphism, polytypism, and interstratifications of phyllosilicates are influenced by several factors: 1) a chemical micromilieu acting during the crystallization in any environment, including the space of clay pseudomorphs after original rock-forming silicates or volcanic glasses; 2) the accepted thermal energy; 3) the permeability.
   The composition and properties of parent rocks and minerals in the weathering crusts, the elevation, and topography of source areas and climatic conditions control the intensity of weathering, erosion, and the resulting assemblage of phyllosilicates to be transported after erosion. The enormously high accumulation of phyllosilicates in the sedimentary lithosphere is primarily conditioned by their high up to extremely high chemical stability in water-rich environments (expressed by index of corrosion, J(KO))(.) Clastic material eroded from weathering crusts and transported in rivers contains overwhelming amounts of phyllosilicates inherited from original rocks. In geological literature, the newly formed phyllosilicates crystallizing in weathering crusts including soils as dominating global source of argillaceous lutite accumulations in the sedimentary lithosphere have been overestimated for a long time. The dissolution of silicates in different dense rocks under conditions of weathering and the crystallization of newly formed phyllosilicates has been strongly and for long periods influenced by chemical microenvironments within each clay pseudomorph. Coarser fragments of eroded argillaceous rocks and crystals of phyllosilicates from different bedrocks and soils are very sensitive to impacts and pressure from fragments of co-transported harder and denser rocks and minerals in turbulent fluvial and similar currents. This is the most important mechanical phenomenon supporting the enormous accumulation of lutite rocks rich in phyllosilicates in the sedimentary lithosphere. The summarized new observations and interpretations are stressed in eleven key points. Erosion and water transportation of detrital material are explained in the terms of hydration, softening, swelling, physical disintegration, grinding, milling, abrasion, delamination, dispersion, and sorting. The deposition of phyllosilicates in different fluid dynamics of streams is expressed by Re and Fr numbers and explained as unflocculated and flocculated suspensions. Phyllosilicates and accompanying detrital minerals in recent marine muds covering vast areas of seas and oceans as well as in lacustrine muds correspond with those transported in fluvial suspensions.

AB  - Water quality assessment is a key task of any measures in the field of water use, environmental management and protection. Thus, it is necessary to conduct systematic monitoring to assess the ecological state in the marine waters and to develop a strategy for its recovery. Anthropogenic impacts of various types leading to eutrophication and pollution of the Black Sea are changing the main characteristics of all components of the aquatic ecosystem. Zooplankton plays a key role in the pelagic food web. This article presents the results of the research on the state of zooplankton which was conducted during the Ukrainian-Georgian expedition in the framework of the international pi-eject "Emblas-plus" during 2016, 2017 and 2019. The ecological quality class of the investigated Black Sea waters was determined by the zooplankton integrated index (IZI). hi Ukrainian waters in total, 49 taxa of zooplankton were registered. In 2017 taxonomic composition of zooplankton was more diverse (36 taxa in 2016, 35 in 2019). In Georgian waters in 2019, 40 taxa of mesozooplankton were registered, most of them are widespread forms in the Black Sea. The most diverse group is Cmstacea (Cladocera and Copepoda).The most prevalent crustaceans were the eurythemfic species, an important representative of forage zooplankton - Acartia (Acarliura) clausi Giesbrecht, 1889 and two thermophilic species of Calanoida - Acartia (Acanthacartia) tonsa Dana, 1849 and Centropages ponficus Karavaev, 1895. In Ukrainian waters average abundance and biomass of zooplankton in 2019 was similar to those in 2016 and much higher than in 2017. Dominant taxa and spatial distribution of zooplankton in 2019 were similar to those in 2016 and 2017. Average biomass of forage zooplankton in 2019 was approximately 10 times higher than in 2016 and 2017. In the Georgian coastal waters annual average abundance and biomass of mesozooplankton decreased, due to a sharp decline in the abundance of Nocfiluca scfrifillans (Macailney) Kofoid & Swezy, 1921. It was found that at most of the stations the dominant role in the formation of zooplankton biomass was played by the organisms of forage zooplankton. By the IZI index, the subdivision Northwestern Black Sea Bays had "Good", "Poor" and "Moderate" water quality in spring, summer and autumn respectively. The subdivision's deepwater shelf and shallow shelf had "Bad" water quality. The subdivision Danube-Dnieper interfluve coastal waters had "High" water quality. The Danube Avandelta area had "High", "Good" and "High" water quality in spring, summer and autumn respectively. The best ecological class status was in 2019 and the worst - in 2016. The main tendencies in changes in the mesozooplankton community in the Black Sea are decrease in the percentage of N scinfillans in the total zooplankton biomass and increase in the percentage of Copepoda Those tendencies indicate decrease in the pressure of the negative eutrophication factor and show positive changes in the forage base of commercial planktophagous fish and the ecological status of the Black Sea waters.

AB  - The paper reviews theoretical considerations and empirical facts on the productivity of mixed species forest stands versus pure stands. The theoretical part first draws attention on the combined effect of facilitation and competition and the net result for both individual and mean tree growth in pure and mixed forest stands (Figs. 1-3). By species mixing, competition as well as facilitation may be changed. Mixing effects can modify the productivity of individual trees and the productivity of the mean tree in a stand, and they can also modify the carrying capacity, i.e., the stand density of mixed versus pure stands (Figs. 4). The combination of mean tree productivity and density results in the overall stand productivity. Stand productivity of mixed versus pure stands can be quantified by ratios of relative productivity (LER, RYT, RPR) and illustrated by cross-diagrams (Fig. 5). How mixed stands come off in terms of over- or under-yielding on different sites is conceptualized by the stress- gradient-hypothesis. Latter predicts that positive effects dominate on poor sites due to increased facilitation, while neutral or negative mixing effects in terms of productivity are predicted for rich sites where competition dominates (Fig. 6).
   In the second part of the paper these theoretical concepts are scrutinized on the basis of long-term experimental plot data from mixed stands experiments in Norway spruce/European beech, Sessile and Common oak/European beech, Scots pine/European beech, and Norway spruce/Silver fir. The included mixed stand trials consist of triplets of plots with pure stands of both species as well as one or more mixed species stands differing in mixing portion, mixing structure or stand density. The oldest of these plots are under survey since about 100 years. The experiments are located along an ecological gradient from Denmark through Poland and Germany to Switzerland; with a concentration in Bavaria and Lower Saxony in Germany.
   Evaluation of above experiments shows that mixing can increase mean tree productivity (dry matter) up to 60% and stand density up to 50% (Fig. 7). While the conifers react on mixing with productivity rise, deciduous tree react with an increase of the packing density. On average productivity increases by 25-50% (Fig. 8). The data reflects a strong variation depending on tree species combination, mixing portion, mixing structure and site conditions. In most cases both species contribute to the positive mixing effect. Positive mixing effects on species 1 are not on the expense of the productivity of species 2, but mostly coupled with also positive reactions of the admixed species. Latter reaction pattern indicates predominance of mutualistic interactions. Analysis of the relation between mixing effects and site conditions (site index) revealed a rather general pattern for all mixtures: Mixing effects in terms of over-yielding are the highest on poor sites and diminish the better the sites are (Fig. 9 and Table 1).
   As causes of the mixing reactions spatial and temporal niche complementary and the involved competition reduction are discussed. Furthermore, effects of facilitation by mutual support of nutrients exploitation, water capture, or humus improvement are discussed. The relevance of the revealed over- and under-yielding for a resource-efficient landscape management and for adaptation of forest ecosystems to climate change and other disturbances are discussed. Finally, we sketch the impact of our empirical findings on the modelling of mixed species stands and the theory of ecology.

AB  - Has strategic environmental assessment (SEA) finally reached a point of maturity in Canada? Or, is it still stumbling to find its place in the impact assessment family? Strategic environmental assessment has been ongoing in Canada for a number of years, both formally and informally, and under a variety of labels and institutional models. The result is a system of SEA that is diverse, founded on a range of principles and frameworks, and not well understood. This paper provides a critical review of Canadian SEA systems and practices. To accomplish this objective, a manageable and diverse set of past and recent SEA and SEA-like frameworks and applications are described and critically analyzed based on a set of input, process, and output evaluation criteria. Results suggest considerable variability in SEA experience and value added. This is due in large part to the institutional and methodological pluralism of SEA, the boundaries of which are not well defined. Under the federal system, since the formalization of SEA, many applications have been disappointing in light of broader SEA good-practice principles and criteria. indeed, some of the better examples of SEA have neither carried the SEA name tag nor occurred under formal SEA requirements, Further, many of the same challenges to project-based impact assessment also plague the development and value added of SEA. Of particular concern is the systematic separation of SEA from downstream decision inputs and assessment activities. As Canada commences review of its federal SEA Directive in preparation for the next generation of SEA, this paper reflects on what it has achieved in the prior. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We conducted a regional ecological risk assessment for a near shore marine environment in northwestern Washington State using the Relative Risk Model. The objectives of this study were threefold: (1) to analyze cumulative impacts from multiple sources of chemical and non-chemical stressors in the near shore region and upland watersheds of Cherry Point (2) to determine the utility of Monte Carlo type uncertainty analysis in a rank-based regional risk assessment and (3) to investigate the effects of model habitat characterization on risk estimates. We used geographic information systems to compile and compare spatial data to determine ranks for sub-regions within the study area. By quantitatively combining ranks with exposure and effects filters, we estimated total relative risk between sub-regions and relative contributions of stressors. Finally, we used Monte Carlo analysis and an alternative ranking scheme to evaluate the effects of model and parameter uncertainty on risk predictions. The regional risk assessment results suggest the major contributors of risk are vessel traffic, upland urban and agricultural land use and shoreline recreational activities. This assessment demonstrated the applicability of regional risk assessment to marine near shore regions and the benefit of Monte Carlo analysis in describing uncertainty in a Relative Risk Model regional risk assessment.

AB  - Water cycle has been intensified by global warming, leading to frequent extreme climate events. Drought is an extreme climate phenomenon. Runoff decrease and human water demand increase aggravate the water shortage of regional ecosystems, affecting regional water and land ecosystems and causing ecological drought, river cutoff and water pollution. Finally, the reverse succession and the imbalance of regional ecological structures take place. The clarification of the concept of ecological drought for effective evaluation of regional ecological drought degree has become an urgent important scientific issue to be resolved. Therefore, in this paper, the typical region of the Yellow River estuary was studied for the analysis of characteristics of regional ecological changes and the definition of the concept and connotation of ecological drought. Based on the representative monitoring and early warning indices to ecological drought, the evaluation method and the classification standard of regional ecological drought were proposed. The regional ecological drought includes four levels: I (Severe), II (General), III (Weak) and IV (None). The indicator thresholds of river runoff, biodiversity and vegetation coverage on different ecological drought levels were quantified. The research results can be technically beneficial for the improving of global ecological drought emergent support capacity and reducing loss due to drought.

AB  - Traditional morphology-based methods can be supported by molecular techniques to identify, discriminate and ecologically characterize the various states of species within the bioindicator community, especially for monitoring the phytoplankton which can be a very efficient indication of ecological and anthropogenic changes in the marine environment.
   P. minimum is a potentially toxic, bloom-forming bioindicator phytoplankton species in the Sea of Marmara that should be monitored routinely as an indication of improveing water quality of the remediated Golden Horn estuary. In our study, intra-specific genetic variation of Prorocentrum minimum was detected with primers for large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), and RAPD-PCR as a genome-wide DNA variation detection tool. Post-PCR analysis was done by fluorescence-based Melt-Curve Analysis (MCA) as well as High Resolution Melt (HRM) and real-time RAPD-PCR which can be a preliminary assessment methodology for determining genetic variation of Prorocentrum minimum in the Sea of Marmara, Golden Horn estuary. This is a case-study for preliminary determination of interspecific and intraspecific molecular diversity within taxa of algal blooms with the above-mentioned methods.

AB  - This paper attempts to characterize the coals of Satpura Gondwana basin using a large number of pillar coal samples drawn from the working coal mines of Pench, Kanhan, and Tawa (Pathakhera) Valley Coalfields of this basin. This westernmost Gondwana basin of Peninsular India is graben/half-graben type and occupies an area of 12 000 km(2) with sedimentary fills (>5000 m) ranging in age from Permian to Cretaceous. The Barakar Formation (Permian) is exclusively coal-bearing with a total coal reserve of nearly 2000 Mt. The results show that the coals of this basin are equally rich in inertinite (22.8-58.7%, 24.5-62.0% mmf basis) and vitrinite (24.4-52.4%, 24.4-56.0% mmf basis). The concentration of liptinite ranges from 8.8% to 23.2% (9.0-26.0% mmf basis). The dominant microlithotypes of these coals are inertite and vitrite with comparatively low concentrations of vitrinertite and clarite. The vitrinite reflectance (Rom% values) suggests that the Pench Valley (0.30-0.58%) coals are subbituminous C to high volatile C bituminous in rank, while the Kanhan and Tawa Valley coals (0.52-0.92%) are subbituminous A to high volatile A bituminous in rank. The localized enhancement of rank in the latter two basins has been attributed to the extraneous heat flow from deep-seated igneous intrusions in the basin. The microlithotype composition of these coals is suggestive of their evolution in limno-telmatic zones, under fluvio-lacustrine control with the development of upper deltaic and lower deltaic conditions near the fresh water lacustrines. The floral input is characteristic of forest swamps with intermittent floods, leading to the development of reed moor and open moor facies, particularly in the Pench Valley basin. The Gelification Index (GI) and Tissue Preservation Index (TPI) are suggestive of terrestrial origin with high tree density. Further, moderately high GI and exceedingly high telovitrinite based TPI along with high ash content, particularly for the coals of Kanhan and Tawa Valley Coalfields, are indicative of the recurrence of drier conditions in the forested swamps. Furthermore, lateral variation in TPI values is indicative of increase in the rate of subsidence vis-a-vis depth of the basin from east to west (Pench to Tawa Valley Coalfield). The Ground Water Index (GWI) suggests that these coals have evolved in mires under ombotrophic to mesotrophic hydrological conditions. The Vegetation Index (VI) values are indicative of the dominance of herbaceous plants in the formation of Pench Valley coals and comparatively better forest input in the formation of Kanhan and Tawa Valley coals.

AB  - The view of political achievements suggests that officials will prefer to implement measures that benefit their own development in order to seek promotions. In the past, GDP weighed heavily in officials' appraisals, leading them to develop the economy without regard to sustainability. Now that the central government has incorporated environmental indicators into the officials' appraisal system, will this lead officials to implement sustainable development strategies to the fullest extent? Are there spillover effects and regional heterogeneity in this role? This paper discusses these questions with the help of entropy method and a spatial Durbin model using data of 30 provincial-level regions in China from 2006 to 2016. The conclusions show that, firstly, the officials' competitive pressure is beneficial to enhance the sustainable development capacity of the province, but this effect is only effective in western China. Secondly, there is no spillover effect of officials' competitive pressure on sustainable development capacity; thirdly, foreign direct investment, the proportion of state-owned enterprises and environmental regulations have their own unique effects on sustainable development capacity, and there are spillover effects. Based on these findings, this paper proposes corresponding policy recommendations in terms of officials' appraisal system, talent training, foreign investment introduction, and state-owned enterprise reform.

AB  - Environmental compensation includes a range of activities intended to counterbalance such negative impacts of development projects that remain in the environment after all preventive and corrective measures have been fully implemented. Sweden, being a member state of the European Union (EU), must implement environmental compensation under EU directives such as the Habitat Directive. However, like in other countries, implementation is not yet widespread in Sweden, and new practices and guidelines remain to be developed both nationally and at European level. This need is all the more urgent considering that the European Commission estimates that, within the EU, about 100,000 hectares of land is converted from its natural state each year.
   The aim of this paper is to describe current environmental-compensation practices in Swedish road and railway projects and to discuss issues of vital importance to the development of compensation policy, such as what to compensate for, how much, and how.
   A national inventory was performed, for the first time in Sweden, to identify compensation measures in road and railway projects. Data were collected from a national mailing list including 141 officials at county administrative boards (CABs), internal e-mail correspondence within the Swedish Transport Administration and databases of court decisions. The inventory focused on compensation measures ordered by virtue of the Swedish Environmental Code. In addition, two case studies were carried out to investigate the planning of compensation measures.
   The results showed that CABs and courts rarely order compensation in infrastructure projects, even though this is possible under Swedish law. Between 1999 and 2012, 37 cases (i.e. permits issued) were found for which compensation was ordered. Of these cases, 76% concerned compensation for encroachments on minor habitats such as small ponds and cairns. No CAB ordered compensation for non-protected areas. Compensation ratios were never explicitly mentioned in permits, but in practice a ratio of 1:1 (often measured as area or length) was usually applied. The compensation measures typically consisted in recreating the same kind of natural asset that was affected, in a location close to the damaged area. In the two cases specially studied, the road and railway planning processes were not properly adjusted to integrate compensation issues, resulting in unnecessary bureaucracy and insufficient co-ordination between different projects, such as between the environmental-impact assessment process and the compensation process or between closely related sub-projects in the same region.
   To meet the EU's goal of no net loss of biodiversity, we suggest that policy requirements should be made stricter and that incentives for voluntary compensation should be created. In line with the goals of Swedish national transport policy and the European Landscape Convention, account should be taken of social and cultural aspects, and there should be a shift from a narrow focus on individual projects to a broader planning approach, since this would allow compensation measures to be taken where they can deliver the greatest environmental benefits.

AB  - Different retrofitting measures can be implemented at different levels of the industrial furnace, such as refractory layers, energy recovery solutions, new burners and fuel types, and monitoring and control systems. However, there is a high level of uncertainty about the possible implications of integrating new technologies, not only in the furnace but also on the upstream and downstream processes. In this regard, there is a lack of holistic approaches to design the optimal system configurations under a multicriteria perspective, especially when innovative technologies and multi-sectorial processes are involved. The present work proposes a holistic approach to natural gas melting and heating furnaces in energy-intensive industries. A multicriteria analysis, based on criteria and subcriteria, is applied to select the most profitable retrofitting solution using the analytic hierarchy process and stakeholder expertise. The methodology is based on technical indicators, i.e., life cycle assessment, life cycle cost, and thermoeconomic analysis, for evaluating the current state of existing natural gas furnaces. Once the current state is characterized, the methodology determines the potential of efficiency improvement, environmental impact reduction, and cost-savings caused mainly by the implementation of new retrofitting solutions including new refractories, new burner concepts (co-firing), and innovative energy recovery solutions based on phase change materials. Therefore, this methodology can be considered as the first stage that guarantees technical, environmental, and economic feasibility in evaluating the effects of new technologies on the overall system performance.

AB  - Thousands of kilometres of coastal residential waterways have been constructed across the globe, mostly in estuaries. These have caused significant environmental impact demonstrating a need for proper management and planning informed by science. Additional potential impacts of climate change, specifically sea-level rise, make coastal residential waterway developments by their nature particularly vulnerable, with restricted options for adaptation. This paper analyses Australian policies on coastal residential waterways over the last 50 years and the extent to which science, including estuarine and climate change science, has been incorporated into policy decisions or policy formulation. This analysis is in the context of theories on the uptake of science in policy-making and against a background of Australian government and inter-governmental reports indicating the vulnerable nature of low-lying coastal development. This paper reveals that coastal residential waterways referred to as canal estates occur in all Australian mainland states but given the lack of any national coastal policy, the onus is on each individual state to formulate its own policies. These policies are on a continuum from explicit, detailed science-based policy guidelines in some states, through implicit scientific impacts informing political decisions in other states, to generic environmental assessment procedures without specific reference to canal estate development. This paper concludes that the extent to which science has been incorporated into policy-making for canal estates is variable across the Australian states and appears to be heavily influenced by politics.

AB  - Ecosystems can be viewed as thermodynamic systems, open to energy and matter, that self-organize towards higher complexity and organization, create order, and self-maintain far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Ecological systems are closely interrelated (in a landscape and in the biosphere) and with human systems, such as urban systems or, generically, economic systems. These relations have been summarized and measured by the concept of ecosystem services and the definition of socio-ecological systems. In order to detect ecosystem properties and dynamics in this context, it is recommended to use "super-holistic" indicators, e.g. thermodynamic indicators such as emergy and eco-exergy. Emergy accounts for energy and matter inputs converging to a system, while eco-exergy is a state-based descriptor of a system's structure based on biomass and genetic information. The characteristics of a generic ecosystem can be described by the relationship among the three orientors - emergy, eco-exergy, ecosystem services - making it clear that inputs are used up, directly or indirectly, to create and maintain a given system state and/or to produce services in output. This paper presents an input-state-output description of ecosystems in a socio-ecological context which leads to a characterization in 8 categories, in order to provide a new contribution to systems ecology.

AB  - 1. Dam removal has great potential for restoring rivers and streams, yet limited data exist documenting recovery of associated biota within these systems following removals, especially on larger systems. This study examined the effects of a dam breach on benthic macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages in the Fox River, Illinois, U.S.A.
   2. Benthic macroinvertebrates and fish were collected above and below the breached dam and three nearby intact dams for 1 year pre- and 3 years post-breach (2 years of additional pre-breach fish data were obtained from previous surveys). We also examined the effects of the breach on associated habitat by measuring average width, depth, flow rate and bed particle size at each site.
   3. Physical habitat at the former impoundment (IMP) became comparable to free-flowing sites (FF) within 1 year of the breach (width and depth decreased, flow rate and bed particle size increased). We also found a strong temporal effect on depth and flow rate at all surveyed sites.
   4. Following the breach, relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (largely due to hydropsychid caddisflies) increased, whereas relative abundance of Ostracoda decreased, in the former IMP to levels comparable to FF sites. High variation in other metrics (e.g. total taxa, diversity) precluded determination of an effect of the breach on these aspects of the assemblage. However, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations indicated that overall macroinvertebrate assemblage structure at the former IMP shifted to a characteristically FF assemblage 2 years following the breach.
   5. Total fish taxa and a regional fish index of biotic integrity became more similar in the former IMP to FF sites following the breach. However, other fish metrics (e.g. biomass, diversity, density) did not show a strong response to the breach of the dam. Ordinations of abundance data suggested the fish assemblage only slightly shifted to FF characteristics 3 years after the breach.
   6. Effects of the breach to the site immediately below the former dam included minor alterations in habitat (decreased flow rate and increased particle size) and short-term changes in several macroinvertebrate metrics (e.g. decreased assemblage diversity and EPT richness for first post-year), but longer-term alterations in several fish metrics (e.g. decreased assemblage richness for all three post-years; decreased density for first two post-years). However, NMDS ordinations suggested no change to overall assemblage structure for both macroinvertebrates and fish following the breach at this downstream site.
   7. Collectively, our results support the effectiveness of dam removal as a restoration practice for impaired streams and rivers. However, differences in response times of macroinvertebrates and fish coupled with the temporal effect on several habitat variables highlight the need for longer-term studies.

AB  - Aquatic organisms present, not only simple sources of accumulated metal, but can interact with metals, altering their toxicity. Due to exposition of biosphere with metals, organisms have developed various defense mechanisms to protect themselves against adverse effects of these ions and their compounds. Metallothionein (MT) is one of that which represents a critical mechanism for detoxification of metals. The sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) is a bottom feeding sturgeon specie and because the fish are dependent on invertebrate species for food throughout their life cycle, the sterlet could be a good indicator of the quality of the state of water ecosystem. Addition of copper to water leads to the induction of MT. The present study analyzed MTgene that was excreted from the liver of sterlet exposed to sub-lethal copper concentrations (0.075 mgL(-1)). To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) of sensitivity of sturgeons to metals, a RNA encoding MT was purified from livers of sterlet, then a cDNA was synthesized and the MTgene was amplified. The primary structure of sterlet metallothionein (S-MT) contained 20 cysteine residues, which is the same as MTs of teleost fishes. However, the primary structure of S-MT contained 63 amino acids, which is longer than any MT identified in teleost fishes but similar to Lake sturgeon and White sturgeon. The complete nucleotide sequence of the S-MTgene has been detected. We have determined the structure of the fish copper-binding protein by DNA sequence analysis of the gene.

AB  - Nowadays, in the rapid river of renewed requirements and up-to-date needs, social relations, characterized by their complexity, have also changed to a certain extent. Development in all areas of human activity is only one positive aspect of the XXI century, but on the other hand we also have a lot of inconsistencies. The latter includes the state of nature and its components, regulation of public relations at the level of regulatory legal acts, failure to give information to people and many other aspects that require further study, making changes and improvements. Much of these facts depend on the psychology of a person and their personality which influences and creates different human actions and awareness of responsibility for them. The above describes relevance and urgency of the scientific and theoretical research for further practical changes to ensure environmental balance by combining legal personality and legal consciousness through the perspective of psychology. All this is achieved by the goal of a theoretical and empirical research, namely the coverage of the results of a theoretical and empirical study of the interaction of psychology and environmental legal personality in the 21st century, as an immediate element in the preservation of the environment and its components, due to significant negative indicators of their conditions. Based on the use of theoretical and empirical methods, the results of the study for further discussion and immediate conclusions are determined. They consist of the introduction of groundworks in use from the field of ecological psychology, psychology of ecology, legal psychology for the implementationfor people of each age category and recognizing this direction as prerogative at the government level. For implementation, a psychologist must be appointed. Awareness of the population with the help of the media and prediction of the principle of psychological formation of the regulation of social relations in legal framework - these should be the steps towards the implementation. Subjective actions should be directed as much as possible towards the fulfillment of the activities of evolutionary-volitional processes and states of a person, which is achieved by directly influencing human activity, skills, will, motives, feelings, emotions, stress, frustration, fear and aimed at shaping the social and biological parts in personality.

AB  - This study attempts to develop and discuss the applicability of a method for using river plant assemblages as indicators of ecological quality in a southern Iberian basin, located in Portugal. Several relevant aspects contribute to make this purpose scientifically challenging. Two thirds of the basin are located in Spanish territory, a large part of the river system is intermittent, the historical reference data on river plants in the basin are non-existent and the distribution patterns of Iberian river plants are scarcely known. A survey of 40 sites was conducted in late spring 1999, covering all the basin. Vegetation data were treated by hierarchical classification and by canonical correspondence analysis, using both environmental (19) and anthropogenic (9) variables. Three plant ecotypes were identified, having different geological and geographical backgrounds. For the selection of reference sites of each ecotype, the environmental variables significantly explaining within-ecotype species distribution were determined by a forward selection procedure and latterly used as co-variables. A partial canonical correspondence analysis was then performed for each ecotype, using a unique variable for the anthropogenic influence, henceforth, leading to a sequence of less human disturbed sites being opposed to the more disturbed ones along the first canonical axis. A cluster analysis for the group of sites of each ecotype contributed to the final distinction of the reference sites, still presenting some intrinsic natural floral variability. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity within the group of sites from each ecotype ranged between a natural similarity variation and a maximum dissimilarity (a community within the same ecotype but with a plant composition completely different from the floral reference). This range was partitioned into four classes of floristic quality corresponding to an increasing deviation from the pro-natural floristic state. The use of river plants as indicators of river integrity and the method used are discussed, considering the particular features of the river system studied and its plant assemblages.

AB  - There is no comprehensive system of describing threats and disturbances currently used in Australia, despite the widespread impacts of human activities on natural ecosystems. Yet a detailed categorization would facilitate the collation of threatening process information into information systems; enable standardized collection and availability of data; and enable comparative analyses of ecosystem condition between stakeholders, agencies, states, and nations, particularly for environmental reporting and evaluation mechanisms such as State of the Environment. As part of the Queensland Wetlands Programme (QWP), a threat and disturbance framework was developed, focused on the pressure and impacts components of the DPSIR (driver-pressure-state-impacts-response) framework. A wetland inventory database was developed also that included a detailed threat and disturbance categorization using the QWP framework. The categorization encompasses a broad range of anthropogenic and natural processes, and is hierarchical to accommodate varying levels of detail or knowledge. By incorporating detailed qualitative and quantitative information, a comprehensive threats and disturbances categorization can contribute to conceptual or spatially explicit knowledge and management assessments. The application of the framework and categorization to several threatening processes is demonstrated, and its relationship to current natural resource condition indicators is discussed. Threat evaluation is an essential component of ecological assessment and environmental management, and a standardized categorization enables consistency in attributing processes, impacts and their short- to long-term consequences. Such a systematic framework and categorization demonstrates the importance and usefulness of comprehensive approaches, and this approach can be readily adapted to management, monitoring and evaluation of other target ecosystems and biota.

AB  - Quantitative risk assessment (QRA) has been applied widely in environmental decision-making. Despite its advantage in taking locally specific details into consideration, problem shifting may occur due to its relatively narrow focus. To achieve a broader perspective, we propose that the combined use of QRA and life cycle assessment (LCA) may be beneficial. The feasibility and effectiveness of a hybrid approach of QRA and LCA were evaluated by considering alternative future air quality scenarios.
   Future air pollution emission scenarios based on different state-based environmental agency policies in Victoria, Australia, were considered to explore ways to reduce problem shifting. QRA was used to estimate human burden of disease (BoD) for the local population due to particulates and tropospheric ozone under 'Low Impact' and 'Most Likely' scenarios. To detect potential problem shifting, LCA was performed for other associated impact categories such as climate change potential. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were used as a common metric to facilitate direct comparisons and aggregation between results of QRA and LCA.
   While the 'Low Impact' scenario was developed to project a scenario with reduced human health impacts (among other environmental impacts), the overall assessment revealed that BoD impacts may suffer a net increase under this scenario. The QRA suggested about 0.74 kilo DALYs (kDALYs) were saved annually; however, the LCA indicated that more impacts were expected, over 8 kDALYs per year. Hence, it was projected that reducing local impact by improving local air quality would shift more problems elsewhere. Therefore, using QRA alone that focuses on local impacts could result in an inappropriate scenario being preferred and improper policies being set.
   The outcomes of this study revealed the importance of applying a broad perspective in environmental decision-making. QRA appeared to be a suitable tool to assess local BoD impacts caused by ambient air pollutants. However, by also including LCA, impacts could be more comprehensively assessed. Combined use of QRA and LCA enables the analyst to account for locally specific considerations while reducing potential problem shifting to more distant receptors.

AB  - Poor utilization of amino acids contributes to losses of milk protein yield in dairy cows exposed to heat stress (HS). Our objective was to test the effect of essential amino acids on milk production in lactating dairy cows exposed to short-term HS conditions. To achieve this objective, 12 multiparous, lactating Holstein cows were assigned to two environments (thermoneutral (THN) or HS) from days 1 to 14 in a split-plot type cross-over design. All cows received 0 g/day of essential amino acids from days 1 to 7 (negative control (NC)) followed by an intravenous infusion of l-methionine (12 g/day), l-lysine (21 g/day), l-leucine (35 g/day), l-isoleucine (15 g/day) and l-valine (15 g/day, methionine, lysine and branched-chain amino acids (ML+BCAA)) from days 8 to 14. The basal diet was composed of ryegrass silage and hay, and a concentrate mix. This diet supplied 44 g of methionine, 125 g of lysine, 167 g of leucine, 98 g of isoleucine and 109 g of valine per day to the small intestine of THN cows. Temperature-humidity index was maintained below 66 for the THN environment, whereas the index was maintained above 68, peaking at 76, for 14 continuous h/day for the HS environment. Heat stress conditioning increased the udder temperature from 37.0 degrees C to 39.6 degrees C. Cows that received the ML+BCAA treatment had greater p.m. rectal and vaginal temperatures (0.50 degrees C and 0.40 degrees C, respectively), and respiration rate (8 breaths/min) compared with those on the NC treatment and exposed to a HS environment. However, neither NC nor ML+BCAA affected rectal or vaginal temperatures and respiration rates in the THN environment. Compared with THN, the HS environment reduced dry matter intake (1.48 kg/day), milk yield (2.82 kg/day) and milk protein yield (0.11 kg/day). However, compared with NC, the ML+BCAA treatment increased milk protein percent by 0.07 points. For the THN environment, the ML+BCAA treatment increased concentrations of milk urea nitrogen. For the HS environment, the ML+BCAA treatment decreased plasma concentrations of arginine, ornithine and citrulline; however, differences were not observed for the THN environment. In summary, HS elicited expected changes in production; however, infusions of ML+BCAA failed to increase milk protein yield. Lower dry matter intake and greater heat load in response to ML+BCAA contributed to the lack of response in milk production in HS cows. The ML+BCAA treatment may have reduced the breakdown of muscle protein in heat-stressed cows.

AB  - In December 2008, the draft programmes of measures (PoM) have been published in the EU member states, which list the measures that will be taken to enhance the ecological status of surface and groundwater bodies, and to reach the environmental objectives of the EU-Water Framework Directive (WFD). We have analysed the German PoM to identify the main pressures and the restoration measures water managers planned to implement in streams and rivers. The objective was to evaluate the PoM and to identify the main, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management on which applied river research should focus on.
   In general, the selection of measures in the PoM was reasonable. In accordance with the analysis of pressures and impacts in Germany, the PoM focussed on measures addressing morphological alterations and river continuity, and the results indicated that diffuse source pollution and fine sediment input were additional main pressures in Central European streams and rivers. Although point source pollution was not a main pressure in most rivers, respective point source measures have been selected for many water bodies. Apparently, these were so-called basic measures that have to be taken due to other EU-Directives or national laws. Therefore, although in line with the WFD, it seemed doubtful if the point source measures would help to substantially enhance the ecological status. Furthermore, the results indicated that there was a general lack of knowledge on the effect of restoration measures and a specific knowledge gap in how to enhance the ecological state of heavily modified water bodies (HMWB) in the lowland region with a high land-use pressure, which was reflected by the high share of water bodies for which conceptual measures have been selected (e.g. developing management plans).
   Based on the analysis of the PoM and a literature review, we identified the following, practically relevant knowledge gaps in river management: (i) the morphodynamics of river reaches where natural channel dynamics have been restored, (ii) the combined effect of measures addressing diffuse nutrient and fine sediment input at different spatial scales (e.g. riparian buffer strips and land-use changes), (iii) methods to identify suitable and efficient measures and to define environmental objectives for HMWB and (iv) the effect of measures on less well-studied biological groups like macrophytes and phytoplankton. There is a strong need to summarize recent research results on these issues, to identify the knowledge gaps and research needs in detail, and to make the results of such a comprehensive literature review or meta-analysis available for the next 6-year management cycle and second WFD management plans.

AB  - Many natural systems exhibit tipping points where slowly changing environmental conditions spark a sudden shift to a new and sometimes very different state. As the tipping point is approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems simplify down to a limited number of possible "normal forms" that determine qualitative aspects of the new state that lies beyond the tipping point, such as whether it will oscillate or be stable. In several of those forms, indicators like increasing lag-1 autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning signals (EWS) of the tipping point by detecting how dynamics slow down near the transition. But they do not predict the nature of the new state. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behavior of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many dynamical systems. The algorithm provides EWS in 268 empirical and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology, and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that characterizes the oncoming tipping point, thus providing qualitative information on certain aspects of the new state. Such approaches can help humans better prepare for, or avoid, undesirable state transitions. The algorithm also illustrates how a universe of possible models can be mined to recognize naturally occurring tipping points.

AB  - This article takesinto account the biological colonisation of the marble statues of the famous shipwreck of Antikythera, a merchant ship dated to the first century BC and discovered in the 1900 off Point Glyphadia of the Greek Island of Antikythera. In particular, the study of the epilithic bioencrustations and the environmental interpretation of the benthic community were carried out to understand the underwater life of the statues. Bryozoans, serpulids, brachiopods, calcareous demosponges and red algae were the most abundant components of the community. Most of the identified species were sciaphilic and/or indicative of coralligenous and cave habitats, well suited to the dim light environment of the site (depth of 50-64m, arrangement of the statues in piles or inside crevices or under boulders). The obtained data were useful to hypothesize the relationship of the artefacts with the marine environment. In particular, the state of preservation of the bioencrustations found on the statues and the presence of superimpositions indicated that colonisation episodes had happened in different time lapses, possibly very distant from each other, but within the same benthic environment.

AB  - Water availability is a major limiting factor for dryland afforestation. Earthworks that modify natural landforms for the formation of runoff harvesting systems are prevalent in the Israeli drylands, with the aim of establishing afforestation projects. However, serious concerns alarm that such earthworks have detrimental effects on the geo-ecosystem functioning. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the impact of the establishment of contour bench terrace (also called shichs/shychs/shikim) runoff harvesting systems on selected soil properties, with,particular focus on still aggregation. Thus, we assessed the effect of the establishment of contour bench terraces in a multi-aged forestry land, comprised of 2-year-old and 9-year-old afforestation areas, and compared them to 'natural' hillslopes as a reference treatment. The study was implemented in the Ambassadors' Forest, located in the semi-arid northern Negev of Israel, where we sampled the surface soil (at a depth of 0-5 cm) in north- and south-facing hillslopes. Considerable differences were recorded for the afforestation systems between the source (inter-terrace area) and sink (terrace-bottoms) areas. Data normalizing according to the relative cover percentage of the terraces and inter-terrace areas showed that the mean values of mean weight diameter (MWD), stable aggregate content, and particulate organic carbon in the natural hillslopes were 1.4%, 32.4%, and 20%, respectively, greater than in the 9-year-old afforestation systems, and 12.1%, 28.9%, and 31%, respectively, greater than in the 2-year-old systems. Means of clod content, aggregate slaking index, and clay dispersion index in the natural hillslopes were 623%, similar to twofold, and 35.0%, respectively, smaller than in the 9-year-old systems, and almost threefold, nearly twofold, and 46.2%, respectively, smaller than in the 2-year-old areas. The soil calcium carbonate content was similar in soils of the natural hillslopes and 9-year-old afforestation lands, which was similar to 17% smaller than in the 2-year-old afforestation systems. Considerable differences among the land-uses were also recorded for the soil texture. Mean coarse root biomass, despite revealing only a marginally-significant effect (p-value = 0.0765), was 40.0% greater in the natural hillslopes than in the 9-year-old systems, and more than twofold greater than in the 2-year-old systems. Hillslope aspect affected some of the measured properties, revealing only slightly better soil conditions in the (mesic) north- than in the (xeric) south-aspects. The data revealed that forestry-related earthworks degrade the soil quality and geo-ecosystem functioning in the short term. Yet, despite some discrepancies, the data also showed the occurrence of self-restoration processes of the geo-ecosystem over the long term. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The evolutionary dynamic of courtship signaling systems is driven by the interaction between male trait distributions and female preferences. This interaction is complex because females may choose mates based on multiple components of male signals, and female preference functions may vary depending on mate availability, female reproductive state, and environmental conditions. In Photinus fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae), flying males emit bioluminescent flash signals to locate sedentary females, which reply selectively to attractive male flash signals with their own response flash. In this study, we first examined temporal variation in the paired-pulse flash patterns produced by Photinus greeni males in the field and found significant among-male variation (similar to 70% of total variation) in interpulse intervals (IPIs). There was no significant relationship between male IPI and spermatophore size, suggesting that P. greeni male courtship signals do not provide females with reliable indicators of male material resources. In laboratory playback experiments, we presented P. greeni females with simulated flash signals to assess how IPI and pulse duration independently affected the likelihood of female flash response. We also examined the effects of female body mass and time during the mating season on female preference functions, hypothesizing that females would be less discriminating when they were heavier (more fecund) and when mate availability declined. We found that P. greeni females discriminated among signals within their species' range based primarily on flash pattern IPI. Neither the time during the mating season nor female weight altered female preference functions for IPI, although season did influence female response to pulse duration. These results reveal that P. greeni females discriminate among conspecific males based primarily on male IPIs, the same signal character previously shown to be important for firefly species recognition. Field playback experiments indicated that female responsiveness peaked near the average IPI given by males at different ambient temperatures, suggesting that fireflies exhibit temperature coupling similar to that seen in many acoustically signaling animals.

AB  - Environmental decision-making and policy-making at all levels refers necessarily to synthetic, approximate quantification of environmental properties such as vulnerability, conservation status, and ability to recover after perturbation. Knowledge of such properties is essential to informed decision-making, but their definition is controversial and their precise characterization requires investments in research, modeling, and data collection that are only possible in the most developed countries. Environmental agencies and governments worldwide have increasingly requested numerical quantification or semi quantitative ranking of such attributes at the ecosystem, landscape, and country level. We do not have a theory to guide their calculation, in general or specific con-texts, particularly with the amount of resources usually available in such cases. As a result, these measures are often calculated with little scientific justification and high subjectivity, and such doubtful approximations are used for critical decision-making. This problem applies particularly to countries with weak economies, such as small island states, where the most precious environmental resources are often concentrated.
   This paper discusses frameworks for a "least disappointing," approximate quantification of environmental vulnerability. After a review of recent research and recent attempts to quantify environmental vulnerability, we discuss models and theoretical frameworks for obtaining an approximate, standardizable vulnerability indicator of minimal subjectivity and maximum generality. We also discuss issues of empirical testing and comparability between indicators developed for different environments, To assess the state of the art, we describe an independent ongoing project developed in the South Pacific area and aimed to the comparative evaluation of the vulnerability of arbitrary countries.

AB  - Recent studies report trends of strongly increasing iron (Fe) concentrations in freshwaters. Since Fe is a key element with a decisive role in the biogeochemical cycling of major elements, it is important to understand the mechanisms behind these trends. We hypothesized that variations in Fe concentration are driven mainly by redox dynamics in hydraulically connected soils. Notably, Fe(III), which is the favored oxidation state except in environments where microbial activity provide strong reducing intensity, has several orders of magnitude lower water solubility than Fe(II). To test our hypothesis, seasonal variation in water chemistry, discharge, and air temperature was studied in three Swedish rivers. Methylmercury and sulfate were used as indicators of seasonal redox changes. Seasonal variability in water chemistry, discharge, and air temperature in the Eman and Lyckeby Rivers implied that the variation in Fe was primarily driven by the prevalence of reducing conditions in the catchment. In general, high Fe concentrations were observed when methylmercury was high and sulfate was low, indicative of reducing conditions. The Fe concentrations showed no or weak relationships with variations in dissolved organic matter concentration and aromaticity. The seasonal variation in Fe concentration of the Ume river was primarily dependent on timing of the snowmelt in high- versus low-altitude areas of the catchment. There were long-term trends of increasing temperature in all catchments and also trends of increasing discharge in the southern rivers, which should increase the probability for anaerobic conditions in space and time and thereby increase Fe transport to the aquatic systems.

AB  - Flood-susceptibility mapping is an important component of flood risk management to control the effects of natural hazards and prevention of injury. We used a remote-sensing and geographic information system (GIS) platform and a machine-learning model to develop a flood susceptibility map of Kangsabati River Basin, India where flash flood is common due to monsoon precipitation with short duration and high intensity. And in this subtropical region, climate change's impact helps to influence the distribution of rainfall and temperature variation. We tested three models-particle swarm optimization (PSO), an artificial neural network (ANN), and a deep-leaning neural network (DLNN)-and prepared a final flood susceptibility map to classify flood-prone regions in the study area. Environmental, topographical, hydrological, and geological conditions were included in the models, and the final model was selected based on the relations between potentiality of causative factors and flood risk based on multi-collinearity analysis. The model results were validated and evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), which is an indicator of the current state of the environment and a value >0.95 implies a greater risk of flash floods. The AUC values for ANN, DLNN, and PSO for training datasets were 0.914, 0.920, and 0.942, respectively. Among these three models, PSO showed the best performance with an AUC value of 0.942. The PSO approach is applicable for flood susceptibility mapping of the eastern part of India, a subtropical region, to allow flood mitigation and help to improve risk management in this region.

AB  - Ulva prolifera green tides, one of the greatest marine ecological disasters, originate in the southern Yellow Sea of China and obtain the highest biomass in Haizhou Bay (latitude around 35 degrees N) during northward drift. U. prolifera shows different morphologies from southern Haizhou Bay (SH) to northern Haizhou Bay (NH). Owing to the distinct nutrient environments between SH and NH, we hypothesized that thalli in NH with poor nutrients increased the surface area to volume ratio (SA:VOL) to better absorb nutrients. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the SA:VOL of thalli in SH and NH. The results showed that the thalli in NH had a lower SA:VOL than those in SH, and SA:VOL had positive relationships with temperature and nutrients, contrary to the general hypothesis. The novel results suggested that morphological differences of U. prolifera were the result of developmental state rather than environmental acclimation. Indicators of reproduction (reproductive allocation ratio) were negatively related to variation in tissue contents of C, N, P, and crude protein, whereas indicators of growth (tissue contents of C, N, P, and crude protein) showed significant positive influences on SA:VOL. The results indicated that a trade-off relationship between reproduction and growth existed in the northward drift. All the results suggested that physiological functional traits affected morphological variation of U. prolifera in different environmental conditions during the drifting of green tides. This study presents new insights into the opportunist species nature of U. prolifera through morphological variation and associated functional consequences.

AB  - The article presents the linguistic features of the description as one of the types of monologue. It is determined that the description is a functional-semantic type of speech, which is its typified variety as a sample, a model of a monologue message in the form of recalculation of simultaneous or permanent features of an object in the broad sense and those having a definite linguistic structure for this purpose. Synchronous (simultaneous) connections, which are expressed in this type of speech, are explicit, visible, directly observable and require a logical comprehension. Linguistic features of the descriptive type of utterance are established according to its types: portrait, landscape, characteristic, interior, still life, description of action, object, state of nature or person. Structural and syntactic properties of this monologue type of speech are characterized. According to psycholinguistic data, it is established that a child in the process of thinking can record objectively existing relationships and express them in a language in the form of a description. The indicators of the communicative criterion were distinguished: the variety of descriptions that children create; the number of micro themes and the degree of their deployment; the informativeness of children's descriptions; the compositional features of descriptions; the syntax of a coherent whole (grammatical methods of inter phrasal communication); syntactic peculiarities of children's descriptions (word-combinations and sentences) and their grammatical system; the adequacy of lexical and grammatical means of child's expression to the language standards of discreption. The particular attention in the work is paid to the psycholinguistic analysis of descriptive statements of the 5-6 years old children according to the certain indicators of communicative criteria. According to the obtained results of the analysis of speech utterances - the descriptions of recipients, the assumption is made that the consideration of the linguistic features of this functional-semantic type of speech in the process of descriptive statements constructing will make it possible to use consciously the diversity of the syntactic content of the linguistic material inherent in this type of a monologue speech, to take into account its compositional peculiarities and grammatical methods of inter phrasal communication.

AB  - The toxicity, bioavailability, and mobility of the toxic element arsenic (As) vary with oxidation state and the chemical environment. Determining the precise fraction of individual As species as well as the total As content in various matrices is essential for evaluating the potential risk of As contamination. We present a synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopic study to characterise As species in a total of 14 different matrix certified reference materials (CRMs) and candidate materials of Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) include sediments, ash, ore tailings, seafood, commodity plastics, and cosmetic products. The validity of the method was evaluated by comparison with the results obtained using routinely applied extraction-based sample preparation and ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for speciation analysis. Our study of the As K-edge fine structure with linear combination fitting revealed details of both the composition and distribution of As species in intact solid samples. The key advantage of the present method is its capability to selectively and non-destructively probe As species with minimal risk of species transformation, thus complementary to more popular extraction-based analytical methods. Depending on the sample matrices and origins the investigated CRMs showed distinct As species compositions, the spatial distribution of which was also investigated. This study proposes that X-ray absorption measurement has the potential to determine the native fractions of individual elemental species.

AB  - Long-term (2000 to 2012) monthly data on communities of phytoplankton, and environmental variables were measured in water collected from Meiliang Bay and Wuli Lake of Tai Lake, China. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was conducted to explore relationships between the phytoplankton communities and environmental variables. Change points for concentrations of nutrients, which serve as early warnings of state shifts in lacustrine ecosystems, were identified using the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). The biomass of phytoplankton was positively correlated with the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), suspended solids (SS), water temperature (WT), and pH but negatively correlated with the N/ P ratio (by mass) and Secchi disk depth (SD). Furthermore, TP, rather than other factors, was a controlling factor limiting the primary production of phytoplankton in most of this region. The change points for concentrations of TP controlling the occurrences of sensitive and tolerant taxa were 56.1 and 103.5 mu g TP/L, respectively. These results imply that an abrupt change in this lacustrine ecosystem has occurred in most parts of the study area, and the turbid state of this lake can be altered by reducing TP loading. This study provides an alternative ecological method for exploring the production of algal blooms and could advance the understanding of HABs.

AB  - Based on the method of automated classification of artificial neural networks, an urban-ecological landscape cartographic model of Volgograd was constructed, using geomorphometric data to identify spatially homogeneous sections of the urban-geographic system landscape structures. The neural network approach and data of ecological-functional zoning allow us to carry out the spatial differentiation of urban ecosystems and to obtain reliable information that is necessary to improve the ecological situation of urban space. As a result of the application of the Self-organizing map learning algorithm and the created digital model, a cartographic model of urban landscapes was compiled, which is a reflection of the geographic environment and the processes of development of technogenic impacts on the state of the natural-anthropogenic complex. In the classification by the method of artificial neural networks, based on vertical differentiation, the features of horizontal geomorphometric indicators information is included. For the first time, the integration of selected genetic types of relief with the modern functional purpose of the zones of the studied urban ecosystem was carried out. The accumulative relief type of Volgograd is identified by the neural network algorithm as a single continual polygon, characterized by a fairly uniform orientation of the slopes. The above-terrace complex is represented by the Khvalynsk abrasive and accumulative terraces, identified by a neural network by morphometric parameters. The water partite geoecological area is presented by gully slopes and near watershed slopes. To classify the slope type of terrain, maps of the exposures along the lines of local watersheds are applied.

AB  - One of the goals of the French national campaign called "Etablissements Sensibles (Sensitive Establishments)" is to evaluate indoor air degradation in schools because of vapor intrusion of volatile compounds from soil gases towards the indoor air, related to the presence of former industrial sites on or near the establishment. During this campaign, as recommended by the United States of Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), indoor air quality was evaluated from soil gas concentrations using generic attenuation factors, and extra investigations into soil gases and indoor air were performed when the estimated values exceeded target indoor air concentrations. This study exploits matched data on subsurface soil gases and indoor air that came from the "Sensitive Establishments" campaign. It aims to consolidate and refine the use of attenuation factors as a function of environmental variables acquired routinely during environmental assessments. We have been able to select the measured environmental variables that have the most influence on vapor intrusion using Principal Components Analysis and hypotheses tests. Since the collected data are mainly related to weak sources (only 15% schools required risk management measures related to vapor intrusion), halogenated volatile organic compounds (HVOC) were selected as tracer compounds for vapor intrusion for this study. This choice enables the exclusion or minimization of background sources contributions.
   From the results we have calculated the descriptive statistics of the attenuation factors distribution for the subslab-to-indoor air pathway and refined the attenuation factors for this pathway through an easily obtained parameter, building age. Qualitative comparison of attenuation factors according to the building age shows that attenuation factors observed for building less than 50 years are lower than attenuation factors for buildings 50 years old and above. These results show the utility of creating databases for consolidating and refining attenuation factors and therefore improving their use. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This assertion is substantiated by the reality that inspite of these regulatory frameworks, the environment is largely degraded with negative ramifications for the twin goals of attaining sustainable socio-economic advancement and realization of environmental rights. Both national and regional state of environment (SoE) reports show that degradation is apparent. It is worthy of mention that almost all African countries have ratified and domesticated the various regional and subregional environmental agreement. Efforts to solve the puzzle have revealed that corruption and environmental degradation in Sub-Saharan Africa are closely linked. Financial impropriety in ecological funds management, poorly equipped environmental protection institutions, and inadequate citizens' environmental management awareness campaigns are outcomes of corruption in the public sector. Since corruption thrives in the absence of transparency and accountability, this study proposes a cutting-edge technology-based solution that promotes participatory environmental accountability using an e-Environment system. The web-based multi-tier e-Environment system will empower both citizens and government officials to deliberate online real-time on environmental policies, programmes and projects to be embarked upon. Both parties will equally put forward proposals on the use of tax payers money in the environment sector while monitoring discrepancies between amount budgeted, amount released and actual amount spent. We applied design and software engineering skills to actualize the proposed solution. Using Nigeria as case study, our research methodology comprised literature review, requirements gathering, design of proposed solution using universal modelling language (UML) and development/implementation on the Microsoft SharePoint platform. In view of our determination to evolve a zero-defect software, we applied Cleanroom Software Engineering techniques. The outcome obtained so far has proved that the model supports our expectations. The system is not only practical, but ecologically sound. It is anticipated that the full-scale implementation of such an enterprise e-Environment system will decrease the current tide of corruption in the environment sector, mitigate environmental degradation and by extension, reduce social-economic tensions and guarantee national security.

AB  - Natural disasters can trigger sudden transformations and move ecosystems to different states where the provision of ecosystem services is altered. These changes in ecosystem services affect local communities' well-being and challenge users' adaptation capacities. We used the ecosystem services framework to understand the impacts of abrupt transformations, in a coastal wetland, associated to a similar to 1.6 meter coseismic uplift after an 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile. Using mixed methods we (1) identified and prioritized ecosystem services from Tubul-Raqui wetland; (2) assessed conditions of services and human well-being before and after the earthquake; (3) investigated postcatastrophe human adaptations and responses; and (4) explored users' interests and visions about possible future social-ecological pathways. Results show spatially diversified effects of the uplift on ecosystem services, both negative and positive, representing threats and opportunities for different user groups around the wetland. The total loss of the cultivated seaweed "pelillo" is associated with the most manifest reduction in perceptions of well-being among coastal users. Adaptive capacities triggered by pre-existing livelihood portfolios generated intensification in the exploitation of less impacted or enhanced ecosystem services which could be reducing resilience. Results show that two years after the transformation there is little attempt to create untried, new beginnings in the Tubul-Raqui wetland from which user groups could evolve to a more innovative livelihood and resource management system after the shift. Although visions about the future are not homogeneous among users, common interests regarding the conservation of key services are shared. The analysis of abrupt transformations through an ecosystem services approach provides a powerful framework for the study of environmental change and associated impacts on local communities.

AB  - Ecological indicators are increasingly being used to monitor the state of the environment. Ideally indicators should quantify and summarise ecosystem function and overall health. However, there is a lack of consensus on the correct approach for the production of these indicators which is crucial to their success in achieving this overall aim. The selection of species and data to include in each indicator are key to the development of indicators. We examine the effects of changing the criteria for species inclusion in a high profile composite indicator based on population trends of breeding birds in England, currently used to represent the status of the overall environment. This is achieved by (i) applying an objective measure of categorisation, (ii) changing the minimum threshold for data quality, and (iii) changing from a species-level categorisation approach to one based on habitat-specific population trends for each broad habitat of interest. We show that the species in the current wild bird indicators, selected by expert judgement, is similar to the objective assessment that we propose. More generally, we show that indicators with the correct species selection are relatively robust to the habitat-specificity of the composite species trends. The most important consideration is the inclusion of scarce species which may be more sensitive to environmental change. Omission of these species can produce an over-optimistic assessment of the health of the ecosystem. We offer a simple but robust methodology that can be applied to a wide range of species and habitats with minimal knowledge of the specified habitat required. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The concept of accumulation by dispossession is often mobilized in political ecological and geographical literature, to explain the ways that capitalist accumulation depends on the violent and extra-economic seizure of land and resources. Yet dispossession is also mobilized as a fear about the future, as a way of articulating historical and non-capitalist motivations for land expropriation, and as an avenue for political action. Amid negotiations for a heavy mineral sands mine in the Casamance region of Senegal, narratives of dispossession circulated frequently, even though no mining had yet taken place. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative interviews, this article examines the contentious politics around the proposed mine, which mobilize multiple timescales. In this context, activists and village residents have engaged in an anticipatory politics that is influenced by past and present processes of land occupancy, environmental change, and state disinvestment, and is aimed at contesting potential dispossessions to come, making claims to resources, and securing a place in the imagined future. At the same time, state and corporate actors have engaged in their own anticipatory actions, through environmental impact assessments and other technologies of prediction that minimize, invalidate, or circumvent anti-dispossession movements. This article argues that experiences of and resistances to dispossession are mediated by the folding together of temporal frames and diverse displacements. In particular, it attends to anticipation as a key temporal mechanism through which dispossession is both enacted and contested. As such, it contributes to political ecology by combining materialist conceptions of dispossession and displacement with theorizations of anticipation and the future.

AB  - The commonness of metal contamination, even at considerable distances from industrial centers and intensively used economic areas, has become the interest of many researchers. The issue of evaluating the state of the environment with the help of living organisms has become a very important part in the control of the natural environment. Honey bee (Apis mellifera L) is a good bioindicator as it is inextricably linked to the natural environment in which it lives. The aim of the research, and at the same time the main assumption of the study, was to evaluate the effectiveness of honeybees (Apis mellifera L) as bioindicators for the presence of Cu, Cr, Zn, Mn, Fe in the urban area (example of Bialystok city). The study includes pilot studies covering three sampling periods (March, June and September 2015). Analyses of metals were made by ASA method. The results showed the presence of Cu, Cr Zn, Mn and Fe in all bees samples. An increased content of Cr in bees was also found, which may be the result of the presence of this element in the environment (air, soil, water, plants, pollen) and in the impregnation agent applied to protect wooden elements of the bee hive. The research showed seasonal variation of metals in bees bodies. The main sources of studied metals in bee samples seem to be motorization, industry, and municipal economy within the urban area. Statistical calculations showed a common origin of majority of studied metals. Bee studies for metals contents can be an important element of a bio-monitoring of changing natural environment as a consequence of anthropogenic activity.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variation in seabird demographic parameters is often pronounced and may be an important source of information on the state of marine ecosystems. Black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla in Britain and Ireland show strong regional structure in breeding productivity, and both temporal and spatial variation are probably related to abundance of the principal prey of breeding kittiwakes, the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus. Annual regional estimates of sandeel abundance do not exist, prohibiting direct tests of this hypothesis. We examined relationships between kittiwake breeding productivity and 2 potential proxies of sandeel abundance, winter sea surface temperature (SST) and abundance of Calanus copepods, within and among 6 regions in Britain and Ireland from 1986 to 2004. Means and trends in winter SST differed among regions, with higher means and less pronounced increasing trends in western (Atlantic) regions than in eastern (North Sea) regions. A negative relationship between breeding productivity and winter SST in the previous year was found within 2 regions (East Scotland and Orkney), as well as in a cross-regional analysis. Results were inconclusive for Calanus abundance, with a positive relationship in East Scotland and negative in Orkney. These results demonstrate that although a single environmental driver (SST) is related to both within- and between-region variation in a key demographic parameter, regional heterogeneity in SST trends as well as the importance of other factors may lead to highly variable responses. Understanding this heterogeneity is critical for predicting long-term effects of climate change or other anthropogenic drivers on marine ecosystems.

AB  - Phytoplankton size structure is an important indicator of the state of the pelagic ecosystem. Stimulated by the paucity of in situ observations on size structure, and by the sampling advantages of autonomous remote platforms, new efforts are being made to infer the size-structure of the phytoplankton from oceanographic variables that may be measured at high temporal and spatial resolution, such as total chlorophyll concentration. Largescale analysis of in situ data has revealed coherent relationships between size-fractionated chlorophyll and total chlorophyll that can be quantified using the three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010). However, there are variations surrounding these general relationships. In this paper, we first revise the three-component model using a global dataset of surface phytoplankton pigment measurements. Then, using estimates of the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, we investigate the influence of ambient light on the parameters of the three-component model. We observe significant relationships between model parameters and the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, consistent with ecological knowledge. These relationships are incorporated explicitly into the three-component model to illustrate variations in the relationship between size-structure and total chlorophyll, ensuing from variations in light availability. The new model may be used as a tool to investigate modifications in size-structure in the context of a changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This PRISMA scoping review explores existing research conducted with United States military samples utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to evaluate mental health outcomes. EMA facilitates understanding of temporal changes of dynamic variables subject to change difficult to capture in standard laboratory assessment. It also elucidates understanding of complex etiology of mental illness in military and veteran samples and treatment approaches. Thirty-two articles published between 1995 and 2019 met inclusion criteria. Most (68.7%) included studies examined mental health symptoms and their temporal relationship to other outcomes among servicemembers and/or veterans, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders. EMA was frequently employed to better understand underlying mechanisms of mental illness, predict symptom changes, assess feasibility among special populations, and assess treatment outcomes. Considerable variability existed in assessment period duration, number of daily assessments, and EMA modalities utilized. Several research gaps were identified, including underutilization of EMA to study suicide risk in veterans/servicemembers. EMA has great potential for increasing understanding of an array of complex mental health problems; however, this highly promising approach has been largely underutilized to study mental health issues among veteran and military populations to date, perhaps due to institutional delays in its adoption secondary to privacy/data security concerns.

AB  - The indirect collecting of quatitative data on the rates of the main abiotic factors by the parameters of the vegetation opens up the possibility of identifying ecological ranges for poorly studied hard-to-reach species, especially rare high-mountain plants. The ecological plasticity of the genus Ranunculus L. in contrasting conditions of high mountains acquires the properties of adaptability, which contributes to the formation of endemic species. Therefore, a necessary aspect in addressing the issues of regional diversification of the genus Ranunculus is taking into account and assessing environmental factors as triggers of intrageneric ecological differentiation of the genus. The aim of the study is to test an indicator values method to determine the synecological areas of high mountain taxa Ranunculus akkemensis Polozhij et Revjakina (See Fig. 1) and R. lasiocarpus C.A. Mey. (See Fig. 2) from the section Auricomus Schur., subsection Altimontana Schegol., endemic to the Altai-Sayan floristic province (ASP).
   To obtain the initial geobotanical material, we used the "Database of Siberian Vegetation (DSV)" computer database of releves of Siberian vegetation, registered in the international metabase "Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases" as ASRU-002 and implemented in the integrated botanical information system IBIS v.7.2. All calculations with indicator values were performed in the gradient analysis module of this information system, alongside with combined taxonomic lists generation. MS Excel 2013 and Past v.3.26 software served as auxiliary tools for data preparation, statistical processing and visualization of results.
   Geographic location of the releves: Altai Republic: Seminsky, Kuraisky, NotrthChuisky ridges; Altai Krai: Tigirek ridge; Tuva Republic: Sangilen ridge. The source of the initial ecological information was the combined indicator value scales for Siberia by Ivan Tsatsenkin et al. (1974, 1978). These scales inherit the amplitude-optimum format of the indicator school by Leontiy Ramensky. Of the four available environmental factors, moisture (120-grade scale) and richness-salinity (nutrients availability, or fertility) of soils (30-grade scale) were selected as the most significant for the differentiation of ecotopes of mountain plants.
   The ecological characteristics of habitats, where these Ranunculus species were recorded, were calculated in accordance with the previously presented methodology: weighted averaging (by cover and environmental tolerance) of all indicator taxa in a releve; the cover of taxa was expressed in a 9-grade geometric scale. Individual species indicator value optima were calculated according to our published algorithm - as weighted averaging taking into account environmental consensus index, rarity of the scale's grade in total sample, number of indicators per each releve. When compiling probabilistic ecological profiles for combined floras of coenoses with a selected taxon, an unimodal model was used, and the indicator value optimum statuses of indicator taxa were weighted by the sums of the percentages of their occurrence in such combined floras.
   Comparative analysis of the obtained values for the factors of soil moisture and fertility showed significant differences in the reaction of the coenotic environment of the model species to the level of these factors in habitats (See Fig. 3). Simultaneous mapping of phytocenoses with the participation of the studied species in the axes of soil moisture and fertility factors made it possible to assess and compare their ecological areas (See Fig. 4). The exact values of individual statuses (minimum, optimum, maximum) of the model species were calculated. When comparing the obtained quantitative parameters with earlier results of our ecological analysis of the genus Ranunculus in ASP, which took into account the confinement to a certain type of habitat and some morphophysiological properties of the species, the ecological characteristics of these species underwent changes. The results of the study enabled us to reasonably determine the belonging of R. akkemensis and R. lasiocarpus to particular ecological groups, as well as to prove the efficiency of the indicator value correction method on relatively small samples of geobotanical data. The study for the first time allowed quantifying the ecological parameters of two rare alpine species of the genus Ranunculus according to the factors of soil moisture and nutrient availability.

AB  - Impacts caused by plans that are the primary components of spatial development are one of the initial subjects of the planning process. Therefore, analysing and understanding the impacts of the plans constitute a critical stage in this process. With the aim of contributing and enhancing planning procedures, this study focuses on modelling the impacts of plans on environmental sustainability state of the planning area with an analytical approach. Thereby a plan can be assessed based on its impact/benefit on the use, consumption and sustaining of the natural resources. Today, possible environmental results of the plans are estimated mostly based on changes in quantity values such as changes of size or area of natural environments or changes of green space area per person. On the other hand, a plan's tangible results on the ecosystem process are not analyzed via an analytical method. For example, a plan's impact on air quality, adequacy of water resources or continuity of biodiversity is not or cannot be assessed. This sort of implementation leads to unexpected effects occurred by plans and transforms cities into unlivable areas. To remove this gap in planning process; this research focuses on development of a model that enables to define environmental sustainability as a function of ecosystem services and evaluate the impacts of especially strategic level spatial plans on services and benefits provided by ecosystems. In recent studies, there are various methods developed for understanding the ecosystem service potential of land uses. Among these models, Burkhard et al.'s (2009) study is notable by implementing an efficient matrix model that includes ecosystem service potentials of land uses. The values of the potential are gathered by the expert-based and data-based scoring of each land use's ecosystem services potential.
   In this research matrix model is re-evaluated and expanded to include the impacts of land uses in addition to ecosystem services. Hence both the benefits and harms on ecosystems occurred by land use are involved in the matrix. Then these values are integrated into GIS; consequences of a plan on current land are and sustainability performance of the plan and implementation area is analyzed. As a result, relationship between environmental sustainability and land use plan is modelled.

AB  - Description of the subject. The struggle against desertification and the implementation of consecutive steppic ecosystem protection plans have become a priority in Algeria over the last four decades. Among the restoration techniques set up to manage or even restore sensitive steppic rangelands have been (i) fencing and (ii) fencing and the planting of exotic shrubs.
   Objectives. This study aims at describing the effect of these two restoration modes with control plots after four years on soil physico-chemical and surface state parameters and phyto-ecological properties.
   Method. Three hundred twelve phyto-ecological and pedological releves were performed both on the restored plots and on controls four years after the initial implementation of management strategies. Phyto-ecological, soil surface and soil chemical parameters were measured for each modality.
   Results. Numerous parameters differed between the restored plots and the controls, including levels of total nitrogen and soil organic matter. However, textural parameters did not differ between the restored and the control plots.
   Conclusions. Our study shows that the implementation of both the restoration techniques in an arid region led within a relatively short space of time (four years) to an improvement in soil physico-chemical properties. We recommend the measurement of the percentage of coarse elements on the soil surface as an indicator of the system restoration state, and the use of the results as an important decision-making tool in reopening restored areas to grazing.

AB  - Residents of Port Harcourt in Rivers State, Nigeria, and its environs have since the last quarter of 2016 been experiencing adverse environmental impacts of particle (soot) pollution. This double air pollution burdenthe unresolved prevailing widespread air pollution and the added emergence of particle pollution considered an environmental health threat, led to protests against government inaction in some parts of the state. In February 2017, several months following the onset of the pollution, the government declared an Emergency, and set up a Task Force to investigate and find a solution to the problem. Global research suggests that particle pollution correlates positively with a range of morbidities and an increased risk of mortality among exposed populations. This underscores the need for rigorous implementation of existing environmental legislations established to protect the environment and public health. Nigeria's rapid response to the 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and successful prevention of its spread provides some lessons for addressing such environmental health emergenciesstrategic action, including effective environmental risk communication, environmental audit, and monitoring is key. Epidemiological studies of the affected population is imperative. A concerted effort by the Rivers State Ministries of Environment and Health, as well as academia and private organizations is required. Public service campaign in terms of government providing up to date information on the existing situation is required.

AB  - In New Zealand, streamside fencing is a well-recognised restoration technique for pastoral waterways. However, the response of stream ecosystem function to fencing is not well quantified. We measured the response to fencing of eight variables describing ecosystem function and 11 variables describing physical habitat and water quality at 11 paired stream sites (fenced and unfenced) over a 30-year timespan. We hypothesised that (1) fencing would improve the state of stream ecosystem health as described by physical, water quality and functional indicators due to riparian re-establishment and (2) time since fencing would increase the degree of change from impacted to less-impacted as described by physical, water quality and functional indicators. We observed high site-to-site variability in both physical and functional metrics. Stream shade was the only measure that showed a significant difference between treatments with higher levels of shade at fenced than unfenced sites. Cotton tensile-strength loss was the only functional measurement that indicated a response to fencing and increased over time since treatment within fenced sites. Our results suggest that stream restoration by fencing follows a complex pathway, over a space-for-time continuum, illustrating the overarching catchment influence at a reach scale. Small-scale (less than 2% of the upstream catchment area) efforts to fence the riparian zones of streams appear to have little effect on ecosystem function. We suggest that repeated measures of structural and functional indicators of ecosystem health are needed to inform robust assessments of stream restoration.

AB  - 1. Lake Victoria endured multiple stresses over the past century including population growth, increased cultivation of land, meteorological variability, resource extraction, intensive fishing, introduction of exotic species and more recently climate warming. These stressors became manifest through a fundamental and rapid change in the fish community and fishery in the early 1980s and visible eutrophication. However, the relation of these two phenomena and the possible interaction of the multiple stressors have been difficult to establish because of the temporally fragmented nature of the environmental data.
   2. Comprehensive limnological observations from the 1960s were repeated in the 1990s and established the eutrophication of the lake, but these do not provide insight to the time course of when changes in trophic state occurred. Comprehensive fishery catch data from 1965 to the present provide a time course of the change in community composition and yield but cannot be correlated in time with discontinuous and sparse limnological data to determine possible cause-effect relationships.
   3. Palaeolimnologic studies were conducted on three cores, two offshore and one nearshore, to establish a time course for the eutrophication of the lake that can be related to time-based data on the fishery. In the 1920s, the cores recorded an increase in nitrogen content of the sediments, but there was no significant response in the paleo-productivity indicators of biogenic Si deposition and change delta(13)C of deposited organic matter. Phosphorus deposition began to increase in the 1940s in all three cores after which biogenic Si deposition increased steadily over time. Responses in delta(13)C of organic matter begin in the 1960s at the coring sites. In the 1970s, the delta(13)C of organic matter at the nearshore site increased nearly 3 parts per thousand in a 10-year period likely as a response to a dramatic increase in internal P loading caused by spreading anoxia.
   4. Nile perch, the large predatory fish introduced in 1954, had become established through much of the lake at low abundances by the 1970s. In 1980, the catch of this fish began to increase, and by the end of the decade, the Lake Victoria fishery was the largest lake fishery in the world; and Nile perch dominated the catch. While catches of some other fishes also increased, the endemic haplochromines suffered a catastrophic decline in abundance and loss of biodiversity.
   5. The detailed chronostratigraphies for these sediment cores established that the major changes in the trophic condition of the lake were accomplished prior to the change in the fish community and that the increased primary productivity of the lake likely contributed to the increased fish catches after 1980. The increased algal abundance also would have greatly reduced visibility and facilitated the emergence of Nile perch as the dominant top predator.
   6. Thematic implications: multiple stresses were present in Lake Victoria over several decades, but transition to a new ecosystem state with a transformed food web and highly productive algal community may have been triggered by a period of low wind stress and then generally warming climate since the 1970s. Unless phosphorus loading is stabilised or reduced, the ecosystem's diversity and balanced productivity will not recover, and other state transitions may occur to the detriment of the lake and its riparian populations.

AB  - Field spectroradiometry of land surface objects supports remote sensing analysis, facilitates the discrimination of vegetation species, and enhances the mapping efficiency. Especially in the Mediterranean, spectral discrimination of common vegetation types, such as phrygana and maquis species, remains a challenge. Both phrygana and maquis may be used as a direct indicator for grazing management, fire history and severity, and the state of the wider ecosystem equilibrium. This study aims to investigate the capability of field spectroradiometry supporting remote sensing analysis of the land cover of a characteristic Mediterranean area. Five common Mediterranean maquis and phrygana species were examined. Spectra acquisition was performed during an intensive field campaign deployed in spring 2010, supported by a novel platform MUFSPEM@MED (Mobile Unit for Field SPEctral Measurements at the MEDiterranean) for high canopy measurements. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests have been applied to the continuum-removed reflectance of the species in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral range. Interpretation of the results indicated distinct discrimination between the studied species at specific spectral regions. Statistically significant wavelengths were principally found in both the visible and the near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spectral bands in the shortwave infrared demonstrated significant discrimination features for the examined species adapted to Mediterranean drought. All in all, results confirmed the prospect for a more accurate mapping of the species spatial distribution using remote sensing imagery coupled with in situ spectral information.

AB  - Industrial processes and the use of fertilizers are the main causes for the rapid eutrophication of lakes. Different indices, both chemical and biological, may be used to assess a level and a rate of the eutrophication process. Zooplankton indices can be among them, as zooplankton community structure is determined primarily by the physical and chemical environment and modified by biological interactions, i.e. predation and interspecific competition for food resources. Among biological indices of trophic state of lake, those based on densities and structure of crustacean communities seem to respond weaker. There are, however, patterns of crustacean communities connected with trophic state of lakes. Thus, an increase in trophic state causes: (1) an increase in the total numbers of crustaceans; (2) an increase in the total biomass of Cydopoida; (3) an increase in the contribution of the biomass of Cydopidae to the total crustacean biomass; (4) an increase in the ratio of the biomass of Cydopoida to the biomass of Cladocera; (5) a decrease in the average body weight of Crustacea; (6) an increase in the ratio of Cladocera to Calanoida numbers; (7) an increase in the ratio of Cydopoida to Calanoida numbers; (8) an increase in the dominance of species indicative of high trophy (Mesocyclops leuckartii, Thermocyclops oithonoides, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Chydorus sphaericus, Bosmina (Eubosmina) coregoni thersites) in the numbers of all indicative species. Crustacean zooplankton was sampled at the deepest place in a lake at 1 m intervals from the surface to the bottom of epilimnion layer, and then samples were pooled together for the layer. Samples were taken once a year, during the summer stagnation. The material was collected from a total of 41 dimictic and 33 polymictic lakes within Masurian Lake District, Ilawa Lake District and Lubawa Upland.
   Among above-mentioned indices, six were the best correlated with trophic state of lakes. Below are formulas which enable to assess trophic state of lakes regardless of their mixis type (TSICR) from parameters of abundance and structure of crustacean communities: (1) TSICR1 = 25.5 N-0.142 (R-2 = 0.32), where TSI = trophic state index; N = numbers (id. I-1); (2) TSICR2 = 57.6 Busi (R-2 = 0.37), where B = biomass (mg w.wt. I-1); (3) TSICR3 = 40.9 CB0.097 (R-2 = 0.35), where CB = percentage of biomass of Cyclopoida in the total biomass of Crustacea (%); (4) TSICR4 = 58.3 (CY/CL)(0.071) (R-2 = 0.30), where CY/CL = ratio of the Cydopoida biomass to the biomass of Cladocera (%); (5) TSICR5, = 5.08 Ln (CY/CA) + 46.6 (R-2 = 0.37), where CY/CA = ratio of Cydopoida numbers to the numbers of Calanoida; (the relationship covering exclusively dimictic lakes); (6) TSICR6 = 43.8 e(0.004 (IHT)) (R-2 = 0.30), where IHT = percentage of species indicative of high trophy in the indicative group's numbers. It was assumed that the lakes with a TSICR under 45 are mesotrophic, those with a TSICR value of 45-55 are meso-eutrophic, those with a TSICR value of 55-65 - eutrophic and those with a TSICR above 65- hypertrophic. Although crustacean indices of trophic state of lakes seem to be less useful than other biological indices, they may be recommended in assessing the quality of lake waters.

AB  - Adherence to dietary prescriptions is critical for successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance. However, research on specific instances of inadherence (lapses) is limited, and findings regarding the frequency, nature, and causes of lapses are mixed. Additionally, no studies have examined lapses over the course of a weight loss program.
   In the context of a reduced calorie diet prescribed as part of a behavioral treatment, we aimed to characterize lapse occurrence, examine lapse frequency across treatment, examine predictors of lapses, and assess the relationship between lapses and weight loss.
   Adults (n = 189) enrolled in a 12-month behavioral weight loss program completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment. At each EMA survey, participants indicated whether a lapse had occurred, and responded to questions assessing situational, environmental, and affective states.
   Lapse frequency showed a curvilinear relationship over time, such that frequency first decreased and then increased. Lapse frequency at baseline was negatively associated with early and overall weight loss. Lapses most often occurred at home, in the evenings, on the weekends, and entailed eating a forbidden food. Greater overall levels of assessed affective and environmental triggers predicted lapses, and greater momentary hunger and deprivation, and the presence of palatable food, also prospectively predicted lapses.
   In addition to characterizing lapse frequency, the current study identified prospective predictors of lapses across treatment. These findings support the importance of lapses to weight control and provide insight for potential targets of intervention to prevent lapse occurrence.

AB  - Recently, an approach for global sustainability, the planetary-boundary approach (PBA), has been proposed, which combines the concept of tipping points with global-scale sustainability indicators. The PBA could represent a significant step forward in monitoring and managing known and suspected global sustainability criteria. However, as the authors of the PBA describe, the approach faces numerous and fundamental challenges that must be addressed, including successful identification of key global sustainability metrics and their tipping points, as well as the coordination of systemic individual and institutional actions that are required to address the sustainability challenges highlighted. We apply a previously published framework for systematic and strategic development toward a robust basic definition of sustainability, i.e., the framework for strategic sustainable development (FSSD), to improve and inform the PBA. The FSSD includes basic principles for sustainability, and logical guidelines for how to approach their fulfillment. It is aimed at preventing unsustainable behavior at both the micro, e. g., individual firm, and macro, i.e., global, levels, even when specific global sustainability symptoms and metrics are not yet well understood or even known. Whereas the PBA seeks to estimate how far the biosphere can be driven away from a "normal" or "natural" state before tipping points are reached, because of ongoing violations of basic sustainability principles, the FSSD allows for individual planners to move systematically toward sustainability before all impacts from not doing so, or their respective tipping points, are known. Critical weaknesses in the PBA can, thus, be overcome by a combined approach, significantly increasing both the applicability and efficacy of the PBA, as well as informing strategies developed in line with the FSSD, e. g., by providing a "global warning system" to help prioritize strategic actions highlighted by the FSSD. Thus, although ongoing monitoring of known and suspected global sustainability metrics and their possible tipping points is a critical part of the evolving sustainability landscape, effective and timely utilization of planetary-boundary information on multiple scales requires coupling to a strategic approach that makes the underlying sustainability principles explicit and includes strategic guidelines to approach them. Outside of such a rigorous and systems-based context, the PBA, even given its global scale, risks leading individual organizations or planners to (i) focus on "shares" of, e.g., pollution within the PBs and negotiations to get as high proportion of such as possible, and/or (ii) awaiting data on PBs when such do not yet exist before they act, and/or (iii) find it difficult to manage uncertainties of the data once such have arrived. If global sustainability problems are to be solved, it is important that each actor recognizes the benefits, not the least self-benefits, of designing and executing strategies toward a principled and scientifically robust definition of sustainability. This claim is not only based on theoretical reasoning. A growing number of sectors, businesses, and municipalities/cities around the world are already doing it, i.e., not estimating "allowed" shares of, say fossil CO2 emissions, but gradually moving away from unsustainable use of fossil fuels and other unsustainable practices altogether.

AB  - Carabid fauna is not sufficiently explored in Central and Western Balkan areas, especially in mountain ecosystems with unique biodiversity which is a result of specific environmental factors and geologic history. Furthermore, distribution of species and adaptation to varying environmental parameters change along the altitudinal gradients. All this highlights the need for biodiversity and ecological studies in order to assess the state of the mountain ecosystems and conservation significance. Carabids as good bioindicator group can be used as a tool for monitoring those changes. The aim of this study was to analyse the differences of body size distribution and mean individual biomass (MIB) of ground beetle assemblages as a response of changing conditions and vegetation types along an altitudinal gradient on Belasitsa Mountain in south Macedonia. Both parameters significantly decreased with increasing altitude and were consequently associated with the vegetation type. Larger bodied individuals and higher values of MIB were recorded in the white oak and oriental hornbeam forest stands with the values decreasing in sessile oak forests towards submontane and montane beech forest stands. This research yielded first list of carabid species inhabiting Belasitsa Mountain with insight of carabid body length and biomass distribution along altitudinal gradient.

AB  - Increasing reports indicated that multiscale fashion is a general and efficient approach to investigate various natural and physiological states. To this end, a generalization of the q-complexity-entropy curve in the multiscale fashion (GMCE curve) is introduced. In addition, the concept of the minimum permutation entropy and the maximum statistical complexity are proposed to simplify the visualization of entropy/complexity in the multiscale fashion, so-called generalized multiscale permutation entropy (GMPE), which is proposed to yield a spectrum of entropy and complexity. We demonstrate that the proposed GMCE curve or the GMPE method is capable of identifying an irregular oscillation is either stochastic or chaotic, highly predictable or long-term correlated. Simulations include Gaussian white noise and 1 / f noise, stationary and fractionally integrated autoregressive processes, logistic map and Henon map. In the application of the GMCE curve and the GMPE method in real datasets, the GMCE loop of the daily streamflow of hydrologic alteration is found to be able of serving as an indicator to basin imperviousness or the level of urbanization. High basin imperviousness corresponds to narrower q-complexity-entropy loop. In the sleep analyses, both the minimum permutation entropy and the maximum statistical complexity show significant differences across sleep stages (p<0.0001*), whereas all five sleep stages are differentiable in the multiple comparisons. Both the real datasets present clearer visualization and discrimination among basin imperviousness or sleep stages than the standard multiscale entropy. Our approach enables us to investigate irregular oscillations with generalization in timescales and Tsallis q-entropy.

AB  - Emotion is a crucial indicator of the mental state influenced by environmental cognition, health, and intention. Therefore, modeling emotional patterns from daily communications is useful and vital for behavioral studies. This paper presents an analytical system that combines psycho-linguistics, statistical modeling, and computational algorithms to extract, analyze, and rank users' emotions from their emails. A new category of twelve emotions is proposed to identify a balanced set of six positive emotions and their negative counterparts, respectively. A lexicon-based algorithm is proposed to extract emotions from individual emails at the sentence level by combining thesaurus and parts-of-speech. A Markov chain model is then proposed for the time-dependent emotion stochastic process. Statistical characterization of the Markov chain model provides insights from four aspects: repetition, revisits, steady states, and emotional stability. Finally, an algorithm is discussed to compute the relative ratings of user emotions and subsequently ranking them from the most emotional to the least. As the verification that the proposed system is able to distinguish detailed emotional behaviors caused by mental activities, the Enron email dataset is used to model emotional patterns from 22 executives who were deemed guilty in the court of law vs. 21 non-guilty. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed system uncovers emotional patterns that are more distinct compared to the traditional emotion categorizations. It is also observed that the guilty subjects express more positive emotions in their emails compared to their non-guilty counterparts, while they are not more joyous than the non-guilty. Such insights have implications for employee risk assessment in organizations. The proposed approach can also be applied to other related areas such as mental health. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The interest in using ecological bioindicators - species or higher taxa, whose presence/absence or abundance reflect the abiotic or biotic state of an ecosystem - as cost-effective means of ecological monitoring has been globally increasing. The main aim of this study was to assess if such ecological bioindicator species could be identified within Afromontane grassland avifauna that would be used for monitoring the effects of livestock grazing on ecosystem in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. We collected data on birds and vegetation structure along 14 transects each in the light (protected) and heavy (unprotected) grazing sites in June 2014 (referred to as the first sampling period) and in December 2014 (the second sampling period). Then, we (i) initially identified potential bioindicator species for the light grazing site, based on data collected during the first sampling period; (ii) examined relationships between abundance of these bioindicators and level of grazing pressure; (iii) tested the consistency of those initially selected bioindicator species, based on independent data collected during the second sampling period. We used the Indicator Value (IndVal) Analysis method to identify bioindicator species for the light grazing site. Species with significant IndVal>60% were considered as potential bioindicator for the site compared to the heavy grazing site. Six species were initially identified as potential bioindicators from the first sampling period dataset, and four of these species were again consistently identified from the second sampling period. Furthermore, abundance of the bioindicators had significantly declined with increasing grazing pressure, but positively correlated with four habitat variables (i.e. heights of shrub, herb and grass, and cover of shrub). These findings suggest that those consistently identified four species represent suite of reliable bioindicators that can successfully be used for monitoring of changes in habitat structure in the site. Recommendations on how to apply these findings for ecological monitoring are provided.

AB  - The concept of frontier has been formed for a long time and in different directions. The main characteristics of a frontier - its flexible borders, a zone of space development characterised by uncertainty and instability - have proved their importance for understanding and describing the current state of the environment with regard to its social, cultural, communicative and linguistic indicators. The interdisciplinary (transcendental) potential of a frontier is realised in a complementary combination of natural-scientific and humanitarian scholarship. The aim of the present paper is to justify the scholarly integrity of the term frontier discourse the conceptual milieu of which is created through two overlapping multi-layered phenomena: frontier and discourse. The paper names the vectors of expanding the interdisciplinary possibilities of a frontier under the conditions of a discourse approach. Frontier as a flexible border is presented in the Internet communication, the socio-cultural space of the modern city, in the daily behavioural norms of the elite, in the family relations and in many other conceptual spheres the list of which remains open based on the ontological features of a frontier. Based on the examples from Russian and foreign literature, the author demonstrates the role of the frontier modus in the interpretation of literary texts whose plot, style and images are projected onto national history, culture, mentality in the by-border characteristics. Such frontier features as instability, its ability to create an interaction zone, which, under certain conditions, can lead to integration, are important for understanding the problems of modern language, speech and genre norms. The byborder territory is a place accumulating violations of traditional norms and providing the material which is necessary in order to anticipate the arising norm changes. The transformation of traditional genres and the formation of new ones also take place on frontier territories. It is concluded that frontier discourse ensures the understanding of norm movements in genre-stylistic characteristics.

AB  - We produced a biodiversity indicator, the Canadian Species Index (CSI), by gathering abundance data for Canadian vertebrate populations and adapting the Living Planet Index methodology. The final indicator incorporates over 3000 abundance time series and contains data for more than 50% of Canadian native vertebrate species. Species abundance declined by an average 10% between 1970 and 2014, with trends varying across taxonomic groups. To facilitate the interpretation of the indicator and contribute to the transparency of the reporting process, here we present a discussion of the indicator's coverage, data quality and data gaps. Using data collected for other purposes means the dataset inherits the biases in biodiversity monitoring. We therefore assessed taxonomic and geographic coverage of the data underlying the indicator to highlight which areas and groups are under-represented. Birds are comprehensively monitored across Canada and are considered good indicators of the state of the environment. Other taxonomic groups are less well monitored, and the data available for these groups often consist of shorter and less full time series, representing smaller segments of the national population. A disaggregation based on data quality appears to show that trends based on species with lower quality data are more negative than for species with higher quality data. We discuss possible sources of the difference, including the relationship between taxon and data quality. Additional data collection on species contributing to the lower-quality subsets is needed to confirm negative trends.

AB  - The advent of government transparency through online data publication should provide a transformative benefit to the information gathering practices of civic organizations and environmental advocates. However, environmental agencies and other reporters often disseminate this critical data only in siloed repositories and in technically complex, inconsistent formats, limiting its impact. We have developed a new open source web resource, the Archive of Massachusetts ENvironmental Data or AMEND, which curates information relating to federal, state, and local environmental stewardship in Massachusetts, focused on water quality. We describe the construction of AMEND, its operation, and the datasets we have integrated to date. This tool supports the development and advocacy of policy positions with published analyses that are fully reproducible, versioned, and archived online. As a case study, we present the first publicly reported analysis of the distributional impact of combined sewer overflows on Environmental Justice (EJ) communities. Our analysis of the historical geospatial distribution of these sewer overflows and block-level US Census data on EJ indicators tracking race, income, and linguistic isolation demonstrates that vulnerable communities in Massachusetts are significantly overburdened by this form of pollution. We discuss applications of this analysis to the state-level legislative process in Massachusetts. We believe that this approach to increasing the accessibility of regulatory data, and the code underlying AMEND, can serve as a model for other civic organizations seeking to leverage data to build trust with and advocate to policymakers and the public.

AB  - Seabird proxies have the potential to act as useful and cost-effective indicators of the state of the marine environment. Seabird time-activity budgets, in particular, reflect short-term changes in prey conditions. We tested an automated technique for long-term continuous recording of Cape gannet, Morus capensis, time-activity budgets using coded very high frequency (VHF) transmitters allowing for simultaneous monitoring of a large sample of study birds. Radiotransmitters attached to leg-rings had no impact on adult foraging trip and nest attendance durations, breeding success or chick growth. Furthermore, frequencies of nest attendance and foraging trip durations estimated by the VHF logging system were no different to those estimated from hourly direct observations. Using time-depth recorders, the relationship between the time that birds rested on the sea surface in relation to foraging trip duration was assessed. Trip duration during chick rearing was clearly an accurate proxy for foraging effort. The VHF monitoring system provides a simple method of accurately assessing the time-activity budgets of colonial seabirds, which can be expanded to a range of other colonially breeding taxa. In the case of seabirds, this approach can potentially provide sensitive, real-time indicators of prey abundance for fisheries management.

AB  - 1. The EC Water Framework Directive requires that Member States assess the ecological quality of their water bodies on the basis of a wide set of variables, including benthic invertebrates.
   2. The aim of the study was to find one or more faunistic indices that could be related to ecological status of shallow lakes, independent of different macrophyte types.
   3. Six invertebrate indices were calculated from abundance and biomass data in 10 Spanish shallow lakes: total abundance and biomass, Shannon's index, percentage of predators, percentage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, Orthocladiinae as a percentage of the total Chironomidae, and Chironominae as a percentage of the whole macroinvertebrate community. Taxon richness was also calculated.
   4. Differences in the values of indices across different macrophyte types were explored by means of a one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences were occasionally found when indices were calculated from biomass data. Total abundance was also significantly different across some architecture types. 5. No significant correlations were found between the overall values of the indices for each lake and the environmental variables measured (ecological status, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations, dynamics of the water flow, and naturalness of the shore), except in the case of total biomass.
   6. Values of indices were plotted (box plots) to detect potential differences between lakes of different ecological status. None of the index values was clearly related to ecological status. Thus, the approach used here, requiring relatively little sampling effort and taxonomic expertise, was of little use as a quality indicator for shallow lakes. The implementation of the Directive will therefore require different approaches to be developed and tested. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Regional ecological health, the core of comprehensive ecosystem assessments, is an important foundation for regional exploration, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. The mountainous areas in southwest China are backward in economy, but industrialization and urbanization have been rapid in recent years. This study assessed the ecosystem health of the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China using a pressure-state-response (PSR) model. Spatiotemporal patterns of regional ecosystem health were analyzed from 2000 to 2016, including overall characteristics as well as local characteristics. Ecosystem health in most regions was improved over time (Y = 0.0058X - 11.0132, R-2 = 0.95, P < 0.001), and areas with poorer ecosystem health decreased from half to one-third of the total area. Analysis of the primacy ratio and the variation coefficient confirmed that the gap in health scores between regions has gradually expanded since 2007, but there are more high quality regions overall (Z of Moran's index < 1.96, P > 0.05). Overall, the regional ecosystems to the east of the Hu line-an imaginary line dividing east and west China into roughly equivalent parts-were healthier than those to the west. The pressure and state scores of ecosystems were determined by physiographic condition, and the response scores by government policies and social concern. The spatiotemporal patterns of ecosystem health were dominated to a greater extent by natural than anthropogenic factors, which explains why the shift in the patterns aligned with the direction of the Hu line. Dividing regions into key management areas based on natural geographical conditions and socioeconomic development could contribute to the formulation of a reasonable ecological and environmental protection policy, guaranteeing ecosystem services in the long run.

AB  - Coral bleaching, cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns seastar, and reduced water quality (WQ) threaten the health and resilience of coral reefs. The cumulative impacts from multiple acute and chronic stressors on "reef State" (i.e., total coral cover) and "reef Performance" (i.e., the deviation from expected rate of total coral cover increase) have rarely been assessed simultaneously, despite their management relevance. We evaluated the dynamics of coral cover (total and per morphological groups) in the Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef over 25 years, and identified and compared the main environmental drivers of State and Performance at the reef level (i.e. based on total coral cover) and per coral group. Using a combination of 25 environmental metrics that consider both the frequency and magnitude of impacts and their lagged effects, we find that the stressors that correlate with State differed from those correlating with Performance. Importantly, we demonstrate that WQ metrics better predict Performance than State. Further, inter-annual dynamics in WQ (here available for a subset of the data) improved the explanatory power of WQ metrics on Performance over long-term WQ averages. The lagged effects of cumulative acute stressors, and to a lesser extent poor water quality, correlated negatively with the Performance of some but not all coral groups. Tabular Acropora and branching non-Acropora were the most affected by water quality demonstrating that group-specific approaches aid in the interpretation of monitoring data and can be crucial for the detection of the impact of chronic pressures. We highlight the complexity of coral reef dynamics and the need of evaluating Performance metrics in order to prioritise local management interventions.

AB  - Jun JJ, Longtin A, Maler L. Precision measurement of electric organ discharge timing from freely moving weakly electric fish. J Neurophysiol 107: 1996-2007, 2012. First published December 21, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00757.2011.-Physiological measurements from an unrestrained, untethered, and freely moving animal permit analyses of neural states correlated to naturalistic behaviors of interest. Precise and reliable remote measurements remain technically challenging due to animal movement, which perturbs the relative geometries between the animal and sensors. Pulse-type electric fish generate a train of discrete and stereotyped electric organ discharges ( EOD) to sense their surroundings actively, and rapid modulation of the discharge rate occurs while free swimming in Gymnotus sp. The modulation of EOD rates is a useful indicator of the fish's central state such as resting, alertness, and learning associated with exploration. However, the EOD pulse waveforms remotely observed at a pair of dipole electrodes continuously vary as the fish swims relative to the electrodes, which biases the judgment of the actual pulse timing. To measure the EOD pulse timing more accurately, reliably, and noninvasively from a free-swimming fish, we propose a novel method based on the principles of waveform reshaping and spatial averaging. Our method is implemented using envelope extraction and multichannel summation, which is more precise and reliable compared with other widely used threshold-or peak-based methods according to the tests performed under various source-detector geometries. Using the same method, we constructed a real-time electronic pulse detector performing an additional online pulse discrimination routine to enhance further the detection reliability. Our stand-alone pulse detector performed with high temporal precision (< 10 mu s) and reliability (error <1 per 10(6) pulses) and permits longer recording duration by storing only event time stamps (4 bytes/pulse).

AB  - Chemistry was misused in an anti-scientific manner to support the accelerated development of mankind, The new ''chemical'' solutions for the mounting social problems (energy, food, lodging, clothing, health care, etc.) explosive demand, were implemented before the establishment of their impact upon the environment or living organisms, Chemist's are not to be blamed for the premature use of their discovery, but this has been done, Being this the case (unfortunately) its imperative to promote actions to reduce the negative effects of the (bad) use of the scientific and technological achievements, Iniciatives toward this goal are being undertaken, Recent legislation, for example, states that major environmental risk assessments should be performed for all industral facilities; also, toxicity and biodegradability data should support release of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Joining this effort comes the rapid evolution of ''clean industrial technologies'' and the widespread use of ''green labels'' to guarantee products and services, Exaggeration put aside, these actions are due more to the organized society than to chemists, which always submit themselves to the politicians and industrial and national leaderships, Anyhow these initiatives have indeed contributed, to the awareness of the elite, towards the necessity to use ''chemistry'' in a responsible manner, developing the noble character of this science and its applications. On the other hand, there's a sector where chemists could and should lead this effort in preserving the environment and valuing life: it's the residue analysis (''lato sensu''), After all, the quality of life being pursued, depends on the means for its characterization, that would result in its better definition and control, But this depends upon the identification and quantification of the agents (molecules) which hinders the approach to the desired quality, In this context, the Analytical Chemistry will bring the redemption of we chemists, Through it, we will be able to guarantee an adequate quality of life and, who knows, the survival of the human race.

AB  - There has been a categorically unresolved crucial question in ecology and evolutionary theory for many decades; perhaps from the times of Charles Darwin himself: Is it possible, under natural conditions, that two species can perform a commonly shared ecological niche? There are two extreme conventional responses that have kept divided the scientific community in this regard for almost forty years: (a) No; that is to say, the well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP). (b) Yes; that is to say, the well-known hypothesis of full functional redundancy (HFR). Obviously, the reliability of both responses depends on an underlying and even more essential requisite: that the ecological niche of a given species can be assessed with such accuracy as we could want in order to detect the degree in which it is shared between coexisting species. This article is the seventh in a continuous series of interconnected recent publications that promotes an alternative understanding of ecology and evolutionary biology which is in favor of strong and mutually fruitful analytical links between biology and physics. This article analyzes the statistical behavior of ecological niches by taking into account two indicators that are essential to perform the ecological niche of all species: species diversity per plot (H-p) and eco-kinetic energy (E-e) as a proxy for trophic energy in a scalar field H-p, E-e in which an oscillating performance of ecological niches is deployed. According to our results, in the same measurement in which the accuracy of H-p assessments increases (reduction of Hp's standard deviation: sigma(Hp)) the accuracy of E-e assessment decreases (increment of sigma(Ee)), and vice versa, in agreement with a pattern that is completely equivalent to that of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics (i.e.: sigma(Hp) . sigma(Ee) >> 1/2h(e)(ec)/2 pi; where h(e)(ec): ecological equivalent of Planck's constant found in previous publications). As a result, the ecological niche is, even in principle in addition to in practice, indeterminable with enough exactness to arrive to a categorical response to the above-stated question. This means that CEP and HFR are simultaneously true and false in the same measure, because the only feasible option to keep the functional stability of ecosystems is a wave-like combination of both options: when species are pushed to a high degree of coexistence (increase of partition of the gradient) in regard to H-p values (a trend in favor of HFR), their degree of coexistence in regard to E-e values diminishes (decrease of partition of the E-e gradient, a trend in favor of CEP), and vice versa. The final sections of the article highlight the eco-evolutionary, biogeographical and socio-economic meaning of this result, by offering plausible alternative explanations to a wide spectrum of phenomena that appear to be only partially understood so far, e.g.: the contradictory results about the relationship between body size, species diversity and macroevolutionary rates; the general environmental scenario in favor of macroevolutionary leaps with a low probability to leave footprints in the fossil record; the unnecessary, although stimulant, influence of geographic isolation to promote evolutionary changes; the island rule; and the general meaning of the interaction between nature and society.

AB  - Ion channels are proteins that are located in the membranes of cells and are capable of conducting ions through the membrane. An ion channel is not always 'open' for transport. The ion channel molecule may reside in several configurations, some of which correspond to an open channel and others to a closed channel. The transitions of the channel between the different configurational states have a random nature. Markov processes are often used to describe this randomness. In practice, there often exist a number of candidate Markov models. The objective of this paper is the selection of a Markov model from a finite collection of such models. We propose a Bayesian setting in which the model indicator itself is viewed as a random variable, and we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in order to generate a sample from the posterior distribution of the model indicator given the data of a single-channel recording. A hidden Markov model is used to incorporate the correlated noise in recordings and the effects of filters that are present in the experimental set-up. The reversible jump MCMC sampler is applied to both simulated and recorded data sets.

We used two techniques: discriminant analysis represented by Random Forests and ordination represented by principal components analysis to discriminate among habitat type classification units, and assessed their relationships with the physical environment.
   Results: Neither habitat types nor series correspond well to environmental (climatic, physiographic, edaphic) differences. Plant indicator species (sensu Daubenmire) representing the habitat types generally failed in differentiating between important factors of the physical environment.
   Conclusions: The failure of the habitat type classifications in discriminating between key environmental factors calls into question the basic premise that habitat types, as used in much of the western United States, are representative of basic ecological units of land. Given its broad acceptance and importance in land management, a fundamental reexamination of the habitat type concept is warranted.

AB  - Ecosystem dynamics are often influenced by both environmental and anthropogenic pressures. Increased demand for living marine resources has resulted in global declines of targeted species, which are often managed under a single-species paradigm that does not fully incorporate ecosystem considerations such as ecological interactions or environmental factors. Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is a more holistic approach that concurrently addresses human, ecological, and environmental factors influencing living marine resources and evaluates these considerations collectively on a system level. For EBFM, reference points associated with management action need to be quantified. Methods have been developed to assign decision criteria to ecological indicators' response to human-use pressures, yet few efforts have established decision criteria in response to the combined influence of human-use and environmental pressures. We translated ecological indicator response into a surface dependent on both fishing and environmental pressures. Using generalized additive models, we empirically determined critical points at which a small change in fishing and environmental pressure results in an abrupt change in ecosystem status. For the Northeast United States Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem, we identified critical points in ecological indicators that represent system production, size distribution, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Our findings highlight the need to include both anthropogenic and environmental pressures for delineation of ecosystem decision criteria.

AB  - A debt-based economy requires the accumulation of more and more debt to finance economic growth, while future economic growth is needed to repay the debt, and so the cycle continues. Despite global debt reaching unprecedented levels, little research has been done to understand the impacts of debt dynamics on environmental sustainability. Here, we explore the environmental impacts of the debt-growth cycle in Indonesia, the world's largest debt-based producer of palm oil. Our empirical Agent-Based Model analyses the future effects (2018-2050) of power (im)balance scenarios between debt-driven economic forces (i.e. banks, firms), and conservation forces, on two ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation) and biodiversity. The model shows the trade-offs and synergies among these indicators for Business As Usual as compared to alternative scenarios. Results show that debt-driven economic forces can partially support environmental conservation, provided the state's role in protecting the environment is reinforced. Our analysis provides a lesson for developing countries that are highly dependent on debt-based production systems: sustainable development pathways can be achievable in the short and medium terms; however, reaching long-term sustainability requires reduced dependency on external financial powers, as well as further government intervention to protect the environment from the rough edges of the market economy.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Ecosystem services are defined as the outputs of ecological processes that contribute to human welfare or have the potential to do so in the future. Those outputs include food and drinking water, clean air and water, and pollinated crops. The need to protect the services provided by natural systems has been recognized previously, but ecosystem services have not been formally incorporated into ecological risk assessment practice in a general way in the United States. Endpoints used conventionally in ecological risk assessment, derived directly from the state of the ecosystem (e.g., biophysical structure and processes), and endpoints based on ecosystem services serve different purposes. Conventional endpoints are ecologically important and susceptible entities and attributes that are protected under US laws and regulations. Ecosystem service endpoints are a conceptual and analytical step beyond conventional endpoints and are intended to complement conventional endpoints by linking and extending endpoints to goods and services with more obvious benefit to humans. Conventional endpoints can be related to ecosystem services even when the latter are not considered explicitly during problem formulation. To advance the use of ecosystem service endpoints in ecological risk assessment, the US Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Assessment Forum has added generic endpoints based on ecosystem services (ES-GEAE) to the original 2003 set of generic ecological assessment endpoints (GEAEs). Like conventional GEAEs, ES-GEAEs are defined by an entity and an attribute. Also like conventional GEAEs, ES-GEAEs are broadly described and will need to be made specific when applied to individual assessments. Adoption of ecosystem services as a type of assessment endpoint is intended to improve the value of risk assessment to environmental decision making, linking ecological risk to human well-being, and providing an improved means of communicating those risks.

AB  - Desertification is a change in soil properties, vegetation or climate, which results in a persistent loss of ecosystem services that are fundamental to sustaining life. Desertification affects large dryland areas around the world and is a major cause of stress in human societies. Here we review recent research on the drivers, feedbacks, and impacts of desertification. A multidisciplinary approach to understanding the drivers and feedbacks of global desertification is motivated by our increasing need to improve global food production and to sustainably manage ecosystems in the context of climate change. Classic desertification theories look at this process as a transition between stable states in bistable ecosystem dynamics. Climate change (i.e., aridification) and land use dynamics are the major drivers of an ecosystem shift to a "desertified" (or "degraded") state. This shift is typically sustained by positive feedbacks, which stabilize the system in the new state. Desertification feedbacks may involve land degradation processes (e. g., nutrient loss or salinization), changes in rainfall regime resulting from land-atmosphere interactions (e. g., precipitation recycling, dust emissions), or changes in plant community composition (e. g., shrub encroachment, decrease in vegetation cover). We analyze each of these feedback mechanisms and discuss their possible enhancement by interactions with socio-economic drivers. Large scale effects of desertification include the emigration of "environmental refugees" displaced from degraded areas, climatic changes, and the alteration of global biogeochemical cycles resulting from the emission and long-range transport of fine mineral dust. Recent research has identified some possible early warning signs of desertification, which can be used as indicators of resilience loss and imminent shift to desert-like conditions. We conclude with a brief discussion on some desertification control strategies implemented in different regions around the world. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services are the nonmaterial ways in which humans derive benefits from ecosystems. They are distinct from other types of ecosystem services in that they are not only intangible, but they require an entirely different set of research tools to identify, characterize, and value them. We offer a novel way to assess how individuals perceive and use their local ecosystem, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art of cultural ecosystem service assessment. We identify distinct environmental "tastes" that represent general dispositions, preferences, or orientations regarding particular characteristics of the environment. We then use these environmental tastes to explain environmental behaviors (e.g., engagement in outdoor activities and resource conservation efforts) and opinions (e.g., perceived economic dependence on various environmental resources and opinions regarding environmentally focused development issues). We identify three distinct environmental tastes: "Landscape" is associated with the visual and sensory landscape; "Biota" is associated with living elements of the environment; and "Desert" is associated with the extreme climatic characteristics of the environment. We report that the "Biota" environmental taste has wide-ranging impact on subsequent measures of pro-environmental behaviors and opinions. We maintain that this taste dimension is important for the ability of researchers, land use managers, and policy-makers to understand and evaluate cultural ecosystem services and to characterize how humans perceive them and benefit from them.

AB  - Tree growth has been hypothesized to provide a reliable indicator of the state of the external environment. Elevated levels of background ionizing radiation may impair growth trajectories of trees by reducing the annual growth. Such effects of radiation may depend on the individual phenotype and interact with other environmental factors such as temperature and drought. We used standardized growth rates of 105 Scots pine Pinus sylvestris located near Chernobyl, Ukraine, varying in the level of background radiation by almost a factor 700. Mean growth rate was severely depressed and more variable in 1987-1989 and several other subsequent years, following the nuclear accident in April 1986 compared to the situation before 1986. The higher frequency of years with poor growth after 1986 was not caused by elevated temperature, drought or their interactions with background radiation. Elevated temperatures suppressed individual growth rates in particular years. Finally, the negative effects of radioactive contaminants were particularly pronounced in smaller trees. These findings suggest that radiation has suppressed growth rates of pines in Chernobyl, and that radiation interacts with other environmental factors and phenotypic traits of plants to influence their growth trajectories in complex ways.

AB  - Using the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Multimedia, Multipathway, Multi-receptor Exposure and Risk Assessment (3MRA) technology, a computer-based biosolids groundwater risk characterization screening tool (RCST) was developed. The RCST, which generates a non-carcinogenic human health risk estimate (i.e., hazard quotient or HQ value), has the ability to conduct screening-level risk-based characterization of potential human risks associated with pollutants released from biosolids land application sites. The HQ is a human health indicator that is equal to the ratio of the pollutant dose (mass of pollutant per unit body weight per time) to the specific pollutant reference dose (R(f)d) which, in turn, is a human health benchmark defined by the EPA as a scientific estimate of the daily exposure level. A HQ value equal to or greater than one (1) suggests that the resulting conditions pose an unacceptable risk to human health.
   The focus of the current study was to evaluate whether the present regulatory limits established for biosolids pollutants (e.g., heavy metals) were sufficiently protective of human health associated with potential groundwater consumption using a new EPA risk assessment tool. Application of the RCST to two biosolids land application sites located near Columbus, Georgia predicted that, when the depth to groundwater was maintained at a distance of at least 2 m, regulated pollutant concentrations as large as ten (10) times the current regulatory limit (i.e., Title 40 of the US Code of Federal Regulations Part 503 - Ceiling Concentration Limit) could be safely land applied at rates as high as ninety (90) Megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)) with no apparent non-carcinogenic human health effects associated with groundwater consumption. At these pollutant concentrations, the HQ ranged from 1.79 x 10(-9) for cadmium to 3.03 x 10(-3) for selenium.
   Only under unrealistically high biosolids application rates were the public health risks associated with groundwater impairment characterized as significant (HQ >= 1.0). For example, when the biosolids application rate was increased to 450 Megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)) and the pollutant concentrations were increased to ten times the 40 CFR Part 503 Ceiling Concentration Limit, a HQ value of 2.23 was estimated (selenium). Similarly, when the biosolids application rate was increased to 900 Mg ha(-1) and the pollutant concentrations were increased to ten times the regulatory limit, the HQ ranged varied from 1.4 (for zinc) to 324.0 (for selenium).

AB  - Identifying inorganic and organic soil contaminants in urban brownfields can give insights into the adverse effects of industrial activities on soil function, ecological health, and environmental quality. Liberty State Park in Jersey City (NJ., USA) once supported a major rail yard that had dock facilities for both cargo and passenger service; a portion remains dosed to the public, and a forest developed and spread in this area. The objectives of this study were to: 1) characterize the organic and inorganic compounds in Liberty State Park soils and compare the findings to an uncontaminated reference site (Hutcheson Memorial Forest); and 2) identify differences between the barren low-functioning areas and the forested high-functioning areas of the brownfield. Soil samples were solvent-extracted, fractionated, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and subjected to loss-on-ignition, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry, and optical microscopy analyses. Compared to soil from the reference site, the forested soils in Liberty State Park contained elevated percentages of organic matter (30-45%) and more contaminants, such as fossilfuel-derived hydrocarbons and coal particles. Microscopy revealed bituminous and anthracite coal, coke, tar/pitch, and ash particles. Barren and low-functioning site 25R had a similar organic contaminant profile but contained a higher metal load than other Liberty State Park sites and also lacked higher plant indicators. These can obscure the signatures of contaminants, and data from adjacent barren and vegetated sites are valuable references for soils studies. A deeper understanding of the chemistry, biochemistry, and ecology of barren soils can be leveraged to prevent land degradation and to restore dysfunctional and phytotoxic soils.

AB  - Gauging trends in forest biodiversity and relating these to forest management practice and environmental change requires effective monitoring and assessment of spatio-temporal trends in forest biodiversity. Taxa- and habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity, or 'biodiversity indicators', are commonly used to convey information about the state of the biological community since they can be assessed relatively quickly and cheaply by non-experts. Direct measures of a component of biodiversity are also increasingly feasible using DNA metabarcoding; 'Next Generation Sequencing' has facilitated the rapid characterisation of combined multiple species samples by sequencing their DNA barcodes in parallel, simultaneously reducing the need for taxonomic expertise and the time and cost required to obtain biodiversity data across a wide range of taxonomic groups.
   We investigated whether biodiversity information obtained from DNA metabarcoding of mass-trapped arthropods and from a range of taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. carabid beetles, vascular plants) provide: 1) similar estimates of alpha and beta diversity and 2) provide similar forest management related conclusions. We also explored how well habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. stand structure, volume of deadwood) predict observed biodiversity patterns. The study was conducted in Thetford Forest, UK within 15 forest plantation stands (5 Scots pine-oak mixtures, 4 Scots pine and 6 oak monocultures).
   Our results demonstrated a high level of congruence between the metabarcoding and taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity. The wider range of taxonomic groups identified using a metabarcoding approach offered the potential to identify taxa sensitive to the environmental variable that was being manipulated experimentally (i.e. the composition of forest stands). Most habitat-based measures of biodiversity failed to predict species assemblage differences between stands.

AB  - A central theme in ecology is the search for pattern in the response of a species to changing environmental conditions. Natural resource management and endangered species conservation require an understanding of density-dependent and density-independent factors that regulate populations. Marine mammal populations are expected to express density dependence in the same way as terrestrial mammals, but logistical difficulties in data acquisition for many large whale species have hindered attempts to identify population- regulation mechanisms. We explored relationships between body condition (inferred from patterns in blubber thickness) and per capita prey abundance, and between pregnancy rate and body condition in North Atlantic fin whales as environmental conditions and population size varied between 1967 and 2010. Blubber thickness in both males and females declined at low per capita prey availability, and in breeding-age females, pregnancy rate declined at low blubber thickness, demonstrating a density-dependent response of pregnancy to prey limitation mediated through body condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantitative relationship among per capita prey abundance, body condition, and pregnancy rate has been documented for whales. As longlived predators, marine mammals can act as indicators of the state of marine ecosystems. Improving our understanding of the relationships that link prey, body condition, and population parameters such as pregnancy rate and survival will become increasingly useful as these systems are affected by natural and anthropogenic change. Quantifying linkages among prey, fitness and vital rates will improve our ability to predict population consequences of subtle, sublethal impacts of ocean noise and other anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - In Amazonia, our knowledge of the trade-offs and possible thresholds in the relationships among social, economic and environmental parameters remains quite limited and hinders the design of sustainable socio-environmental systems. To fill this gap, we analyzed relationships among landscape metrics, socioeconomic patterns, biodiversity and soil-based ecosystem services within a total of 51 farms located at 6 sites of the Colombian and Brazilian Amazon. Farms were representative of an initial set of 274 and they represented colonization ages from 10 to 80 years and a range of public policies found in the region.
   Cluster analysis separated farms in 7 types of production systems according to 5 main criteria (size of the farm, human capital, incomes, farm,products and production intensity) selected from an initial set of 18 criteria. Biodiversity was summarized into a composite index Bd built with data from 8 different groups: trees, shrubs, grasses and forbs, birds, Saturnidae and Sphingidae moths, Drosophilidae, earthworms and ants. Provision of ecosystem services was quantified by a composite indicator of 6 sub indicators of soil hydrological functions, C storage and chemical fertility. Increasing intensity of production systems was linked to a significant decrease of indicators of natural capital biodiversity (Bd) and soil based ecosystem services (Es) with 20% and 37.3% variance explained, respectively. No relationship was observed between production systems and an indicator of human wellbeing (Sb) based on a set of 5 criteria identified with the farmers. Findings indicate that early colonizers migrate when a certain level of development has been achieved (as a result of their activities) and are replaced by wealthier populations. An overall indicator of sustainability (Su)- that combines production efficiency (Ep), Sb,Bd and Es indices (ranging from 0.1-1.0)- decreases significantly with the landscape intensification (Li) with 18.7% variance directly explained by this relationship. Su was also significantly related to production systems (36.4% variance explained): while this indicator remained relatively stable with a value of 0.5 across the early and intermediate phases following deforestation, it dropped down considerably (0.2) for production systems based on cattle ranching on highly degraded pastures with less than 2% forest cover remaining. Restoration with sylvopastoral systems allowed some farms of this former group to increase sustainability to a value of 0.35 after less than 5 years. Agroforestry systems on sites deforested at the same time maintained values around 0.5, as they allowed the maximum production efficiencies and maintained relatively high values of the Biodiversity (Bd) and Ecosystem services (Es) indexes. This is evidence that beyond the general negative trade-off between human development and natural capital observed in Amazonia, agro ecological options to revert the trend are quite promising. A general methodological approach for the reconstruction of sustainable landscapes in farms of the deforested Amazonian region is proposed as a conclusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article deals with environmental management of the objects and territories of the Eastern Podillya Nature Reserve in the structure of the regional ecological network from the standpoint of physical and geographical zoning. A system of approaches and principles is proposed, which should be used when forming a network of protected objects. The main criterion for the selection of these objects should be the principle of representativeness, while it is advisable to take into account their three types - biotic (botanical; zoological; mycological); geographical (landscape; biogeographic); geosozological (objective; categorical; functional). The area, its size, configuration, state of internal ecological equilibrium, he qualitative and quantitative composition of the protected objects, the degree of anthropogenic impact and the types of conservation regimes play an important role in the creation of the protected objects. But also, of great importance in forming a network of protected objects is the matrix representation, which is widely used in EU countries. The basis is the landscape-zonal principle, where the matrix of biodiversity and landscapes are systems of units of natural areas (biogeographical, geobotanical, floristic, zoogeographic, physical and geographical). According to this principle, the creation of protected objects must be represented by typical (indicator) species of biodiversity, landscapes of all natural zones, subzones, regions, provinces, sub-provinces, districts. On-site surveys of the Eastern Podillya have found that a large proportion of protected sites do not fulfill the function of biodiversity and landscape diversity. The conducted field studies have shown that in the present ecological conditions of the region there is a risk of loss of this diversity. Therefore, using the principle of representativeness, we propose to optimize the nature reserve fund of Eastern Podillya from the point of view of physical and geographical zoning.

AB  - Ecosystems may shift abruptly between alternative states in response to environmental perturbations [1-3]. Early warning indicators have been proposed to anticipate such regime shifts, but experimental field tests of their validity are rare [4-6]. We exposed rocky intertidal algal canopies to a gradient of press perturbations and recorded the response of associated assemblages over 7 years. Reduced cover and biomass of algal canopies promoted the invasion of algal turfs, driving understory assemblages toward collapse upon total canopy removal. A dynamic model indicated the existence of a critical threshold separating the canopy- and turf-dominated states. We evaluated common indicators of regime shift as the system approached the threshold, including autocorrelation, SD, and skewness [7]. These indicators captured changes in understory cover due to colonization of algal turfs. All indicators increased significantly as the system approached the critical threshold, in agreement with theoretical predictions [2, 8, 9]. The performance of indicators changed when we superimposed a pulse disturbance on the press perturbation that amplified environmental noise. This treatment caused several experimental units to switch repeatedly between the canopy- and the turf-dominated state, resulting in a significant increase in overall variance of understory cover, a negligible effect on skewness and no effect on autocorrelation. Power analysis indicated that autocorrelation and SD were better suited at anticipating a regime shift under mild and strong fluctuations of the state variable, respectively. Our results suggest that regime shifts may be anticipated under a broad range of fluctuating conditions using the appropriate indicator.

AB  - Phytoplankton size structure impacts ocean food-web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling, and is thus an important ecological indicator that can be utilised to quantitatively evaluate the state of marine ecosystems. Potential alterations to size structure are predicted to occur in tropical regions under future scenarios of climate change. Therefore, there is an increasing requirement for the synoptic monitoring of phytoplankton size structure in marine systems. The Red Sea remains a comparatively unexplored tropical marine ecosystem, particularly with regards to its large-scale biological dynamics. Using an in situ pigment dataset acquired in the Red Sea, we parameterise a two-component, abundance-based phytoplankton size model and apply it to remotely-sensed observations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, to infer Chl-a in two size classes of phytoplankton, small cells < 2 mu m in size (picophytoplankton) and large cells > 2 mu m in size. Satellite-derived estimates of phytoplankton size structure are in good agreement with corresponding in situ measurements and also capture the spatial variability related to regional mesoscale dynamics. Our analysis reveals that, for the estimation of Chl-a in the two size classes, the model performs comparably or in some cases better, to validations in other oceanic regions. Our model parameterisation will be useful for future studies on the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton size classes in the Red Sea, which may ultimately be relevant for understanding trophic linkages between phytoplankton size structure and fisheries, and the development of marine management strategies.

AB  - Background Population growth and intensified human activities in conjunction with climate variability continue to affect the hydrologic cycle, aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna. In this regard, understanding interactions among ecosystem functions, impacts of anthropogenic interventions and those of climate variability is vital for projecting future ecosystem responses to human activities and climate forcing. The objectives of this study are to determine the ecological flow state via eco-flow index based on discharge hydrograph, to model the ecological diversity through the Shannon diversity index, and to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration using indicators of hydrologic alteration and range of variability approach in six hydrometric stations along the Zayandeh-Rud River in central Iran. The river drains into Gavkhuni Marsh. Also, the streamflow-induced potential changes for Capoeta damascina (a cyprinid fish species of the genus Capoeta), Petroleuciscus esfahani (a small cyprinid fish) and Aphanius isfahanensis (a Cyprinodontid fish) are evaluated. The outcome is expected to assist managers with understanding the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate variability on Gavkhuni aquatic ecosystems so that management options that enhance species resilience and adaptability are outlined. Results Human activities, a primary factor influencing the natural flow regime, caused a significant increase in the minimum flow, July to March streamflow, low pulse number, and the number of reversals in most studied stations. On the contrary, some other hydrologic indices declined in value. Reservoir impoundment, the most prominent factor among human interventions, resulted in an overall alteration degree of 74.8% in streamflow. Climate variability impacted the natural flow regime in the range of low degree hydrologic alteration (27.3%). In addition, the biodiversity of the study basin, as modeled by the Shannon diversity index, had strong relevance to the annual eco-surplus and was more sensitive to summer floods and autumn hydrological droughts than other factors. Conclusions This study corroborates the effectiveness of scenario-based hydrological modeling framework in evaluating the impacts of climate variability and human activities imposed on natural flow metrics. Additionally, the recently introduced eco-flow metrics based on discharge hydrographs and the Shannon diversity index based on indicators of hydrological alteration may be adopted in basins lacking ecological data. These two indices can effectively identify the most prominent factors in hydrological alteration and biodiversity change through a river network and may provide scientific decision-making support for water resource management in the study area.

AB  - The control of mercury in the biosphere is of lasting importance, as it is a toxicant of the first hazard class. Bottom sediments, as a depositing medium, are an important indicator of the long-term ecological state of a water body. In Russia, the hygienic standards for the content of pollutants in bottom sediments of surface water bodies within populated areas have not been approved. To diagnose Hg accumulation, we used comparisons of our results with the background content and threshold levels of hazardous concentrations.These are the domestic regional and Norwegian standards, the Dutch lists of pollutants.
   The distribution of mercury in bottom silt-pelit and fine and fine-grained sands of dynamically heterogeneous zones of the KaliningradGulf, in the Kaliningrad Sea Canal (KSC) is olated from the open water area and in river mouths that flow into this Russian sector of the Vistula Lagoon of the Baltic Sea, was investigated. Peculiarities of accumulation - mercury scattering are traced for the period 2000-2019. Hg determinations were carried out by accredited laboratories using metrologically certified, but different in accuracy methods: 1) highly sensitive flameless atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) using the "cold steam" technique (Julia-5K instrument with a detection limit of 0.005 mg/g), 2) using a modified scheme of the Zeeman effect and mercury spectrometers (detection limits Hg = 0.001-0.005 mg/kg).
   It has been established: from spring to autumn, the activation of storms and surges in the lagoon, the strengthening of the leaching regime of the channels provide a significant decrease in river mouths, and in the dynamically weakened conditions of the KaliningradSeaCanal, an increase in the amount of mercury. The use of the IVA method has led to significant overestimation of the mercury content. In bays of the navigable sea channel, in dynamically problematic areas of the estuary of the gulf and the Primorskaya Bay, and also against the background (alluvium of the Daima River) over a 20-year period, metal accumulated in bottom sediments (up to 0.155-0.261 mg/kg; determination method - AAS). Against the background, the concentration increased by 3.6 times (from 0.023 to 0.082 mg/kg). In the dynamically weakened and active zones of the estuary - 1.7 and 1.4 times, respectively (from 0.90 to 0.155 mg/kg and from 0.050 to 0.070 mg/kg, respectively). The process ensured a transition from predominantly background accumulation of mercury (<0.15 mg/kg) to satisfactory conditions of a weak level of their pollution with the toxicant of bottom sediments. However, the safe target level of Hg = 0.3 mg/kg is still not exceeded and the current environmental and epidemiological situation regarding the mercury content in the component of surface water bodies that deposit pollutants in the region can be considered successful.
   Comparison of the results of mercury determinations by different methods indicates the inadmissibility of using low-sensitivity analysis methods for this purpose (inversion voltammetry). The indisputable priority in analytics belongs to the high-precision method of atomic absorption spectrometry using the technique of "cold vapor" and mercury spectrometers.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an important indicator of the state of marine ecosystems. In the current study, the interannual-decadal variation in the Bohai Sea's surface Chl-a concentration and the underlying dynamics are investigated based on 16 years (August 2002-February 2019) of satellite ocean colour observations. The Chl-a concentration shows a spatially coherent increasing trend from 2003 to 2011 and a decreasing trend from 2012 to 2018 in both the Bohai and North Yellow Seas. Both decadal trends are clearer in the Bohai Sea than in the Yellow Sea and in coastal waters than in offshore waters. The decreasing trend is more obvious than the increasing trend. The low-frequency variations are mainly controlled by sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall variations and eventually related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). During positive PDO phases, warm SST anomalies exist in the Bohai and Yellow Seas and negative rainfall anomalies exist over the sea and surrounding lands. These anomalies would decrease the surface layer dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration through suppressing the upward turbulent nutrient diffusion and reducing land-sourced nutrient fluxes into the ocean, leading to negative Chl-a concentration anomalies. During negative PDO phases, the opposite situation occurs. Human activities may make a secondary contribution through enhancing/reducing the anthropogenic nitrogen emission before/after 2011. This study emphasizes the natural climate variability in modulating low-frequency variations in surface Chl-a concentrations in the Bohai and Yellow Seas in recent decades and is useful for marine resource planning and marine ecological management in the Bohai Sea in the future.

AB  - The natural resources as the constituent of the natural environment and their condition are determined, which requires immediate action. The interaction of a person, his activity with the natural environment is characterized. Economic indicators, including price policy, social guarantees, protection and protection of economic activity in comparison with the international and European status are determined. The analysis of components of the environment in Ukraine is given and the legal bases for the settlement and protection of human rights and freedoms are defined. Potentially possible activities for Ukraine are outlined. The vectors of development and support from the state of Ukraine are analyzed. The direction of development of farming, which today is defined as the creation of a legal entity, with the statute, mandatory state registration, with the opening of an account in a financial institution, is determined in the framework of the current regulatory framework. Attention is drawn to the support of family forms of economic activity at the European level. In order to protect natural resources as constituents of the natural environment and components of human life, it is proposed to take measures to support and develop small and medium business entities, as well as directly owners of land plots, including land plots (shares). The prospects for the introduction of organic farming in Ukraine as an element of the state of the environment change are determined. The necessity of taking a number of economic and legal actions that will be directed not only to protect and protect the rights of citizens of Ukraine but also to meet the commitments that Ukraine has assumed through European integration will meet the generally accepted international and European requirements in the field of conducting international relations for different vectors, and also create conditions for attracting foreign investments into Ukraine.

AB  - Restoration of the Pinus palustris (longleaf pine)-wiregrass ecosystem of the southeastern United States requires information on reference conditions such as the historical fire regime. Aristida beyrichiana (wiregrass), a keystone perennial bunchgrass, was historically widespread throughout the southeast, but its dependence upon growing season fires for sexual reproduction hastened its decline in the face of decades of human fire suppression. The reproductive response of wiregrass is described by patterns of meristem allocation between competing life history strategies (i.e., vegetative growth vs. sexual reproduction). The temporal link between fire and flowering indicates this allocation was optimized to the historical fire regime through selection. In this study, we used the observed allocation of wiregrass reproductive effort to sexual reproduction as the response variable to examine reproductive response to fire season, using plant size as a covariate. Sexual reproduction was positively associated with plant size. Plants burned during early summer (May-June) produced a greater proportion of inflorescences than did those burned in early spring (March-April) or in late summer (August). Using state records of natural (lightning-ignited) and anthropogenic (human-ignited) fires from historical (1933-1946) and contemporary (19982010) periods we found that the distribution of maximum wiregrass reproductive output most closely reflected the distribution of historical fires with natural ignition sources. Moreover, while the monthly distributions of historical and contemporary fires were different for anthropogenic ignitions, they did not differ for fires with natural ignitions. Our predictions of peak allocation based upon the biology of wiregrass provide strong support for the use of wiregrass as an indicator of the historical fire season (early summer). Efforts to restore the longleaf pine ecosystem should therefore consider the biological response of wiregrass in planning prescribed fires.

AB  - Enterococci have been recommended as suitable bacteria indicators for assessing the microbial quality of recreational waters. However, recent studies have shown that bacteria, including enterococci, are able to enter a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state under environmentally stressed conditions, where they may remain undetected if culture-based methods are employed. To appreciate the extent of transformation of these cells in surface waters, a model Enterococcus organism, E. faecalis, was examined in laboratory controlled microcosms under different light and salinity conditions. Cells were detected by both standard culture-based and PMA-qPCR (propidium monoazide quantitative PCR) methods so that the VBNC cells could be enumerated. The decay rates from the culture based method (k(c)) and PMA-qPCR method (k(p)) were established for the different conditions. In general, the k(c) values (ranging from 0.0088 hr(-1) to 0.9755 hr(-1)) were always higher than the k(p) values (0.0019 hr(-1) to 0.2373 hr(-1)), implying that cells were able to retain their viability for much longer periods than what is shown by the culture-based method. In both cases, the k values generally showed an increasing trend with an increase in light irradiation, implying greater die-off with light. For freshwater microcosms, the k(p) values were 3-6 times lower than the k(c) values for different irradiation conditions, whereas for seawater the difference was up to 12 times, showing that E. faecalis adapts well to seawater. The kinetic data were used to develop models to describe the dynamics of VBNC formation in natural waters. At low light intensities (less than about 20 Wm(-2)), the proportion of VBNC cells was found to steadily increase to as high as 50%, even after 4 days. However, at higher light levels, this proportion was achieved more quickly (less than 5 h) but also diminished more rapidly. Hence, at high light levels, the percentage of VBNC cells is expected to be significant only for a few hours, whereas at low light levels, the VBNC cells can be expected to be present for a long period of time. These results have implications on the interpretation of microbial water quality data that are based on culture based methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Health assessment and risk factor identification represent the premise and foundation of scientific management and ecological restoration of urban lakes. Based on in-depth understanding of the nature-society duality of urban lakes, a framework for evaluating urban lake health was constructed, including four modules, namely, establishing an index system; determining the index weight; identifying risk factors; and a comprehensive lake health evaluation. Employing this framework, we evaluated Lianshi Lake, Beijing, classifying the lake condition as "sub-healthy". Based on the evaluation data, we identified the health risk factors of the lake. We applied standard difference rate (SDR) and risk degree (Rd) (safe degree (Sd)) concepts, and classified the indices of risk areas employing the Pareto analysis method. Finally, we identified the lake residence period, landscape connectivity, and eutrophication as the major risk factors in Lianshi Lake. Three factors constitute the basis of ecosystem health and are key targets of ecological restoration: the lake residence period represents the hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics of the lake; landscape connectivity is described from an ecological perspective, and represents the integrity of the lake ecosystem; and the eutrophication states describe the water quality characteristics and represent the availability of lake water.

AB  - In marine environments, noise from human activities is increasing dramatically, causing animals to alter their behavior and forage less efficiently. These alterations incur energetic costs that can result in reproductive failure and death and may ultimately influence population viability, yet the link between population dynamics and individual energetics is poorly understood. We present an energy budget model for simulating effects of acoustic disturbance on populations. It accounts for environmental variability and individual state, while incorporating realistic animal movements. Using harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) as a case study, we evaluated population consequences of disturbance from seismic surveys and investigated underlying drivers of vulnerability. The framework reproduced empirical estimates of population structure and seasonal variations in energetics. The largest effects predicted for seismic surveys were in late summer and fall and were unrelated to local abundance, but instead were related to lactation costs, water temperature, and body fat. Our results demonstrate that consideration of temporal variation in individual energetics and their link to costs associated with disturbances is imperative when predicting disturbance impacts. These mechanisms are general to animal species, and the framework presented here can be used for gaining new insights into the spatiotemporal variability of animal movements and energetics that control population dynamics.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development brought new constraints for the old-fashioned business models. At the same time, it created new opportunities for those who have a forward-looking strategy and strive to overcome "the limits to growth", in other words, to ensure a long-term blended value creation with economic and non-economic benefits.
   There are numerous sets of the sustainable development indicators and indices, but the weights of each particular component are different and need further clarification. Nowadays, the environmental risks in general and climate-related in particular are priced (e.g. environmental taxes) and have a strong impact on the social and economic relations by creating negative and positive externalities for our daily life. For this reason, economic agents are forced to become sustainable to the non-financial risks through switching to the new environmental and social business models. For this reason, better sustainable development indicators are crucial for an improved management of the non-financial risks and sustainable blended value creation.
   Hence, the aim of this paper is to examine the role of environmental risks in shaping sustainable development conditions on the macrolevel and to elaborate the ways for a better management of the nonfinancial risks (Environmental, Social and Governance - ESG). For this purpose, the impact of the most important environmental risks on the main economic and social indicators has been examined (e.g. Human Development Index and GDP per capita). Such an approach allowed us to identify the extent to which specific environmental factors influencing social and economic development can reshape the sustainable development conditions.
   In course of research, two sets of countries have been singled out to verify statistical significance of elaborated models. To achieve this goal, the authors have split an available dataset into two groups: EU and non-EU countries. The reason behind it is the fact that EU countries are among the leaders in the area of sustainable development and have already undertaken related environmental improvements in the last decades. Moreover, the above-mentioned countries are continuing such successful pathways today and with the new European Green Deal could go even far beyond this frontier.
   The results of current research suggest that existing indicators cannot fully encompass all the aspects of sustainable development and should be revised. Such findings relate both to the composition of the indicators and the weights attributed to each particular component. The application of regression analysis showed that such factors as water and air quality and biodiversity have the strongest explanatory power - 67% of the fluctuations in GDP per capita and 87% in case of HDI. The R-squared is ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 in both cases and confirms consistency of the elaborated models. To verify the results achieved, the similar models have been prepared only for the EU countries. As a result, all independent variables demonstrated the same significant impact on GDP per capita also for the EU countries. However, in this case the R-squared is only 0.27 due to the fact that ESG indicators within the EU area are rather homogenous. The impact of environmental factors on the level of HDI for the EU countries is much stronger comparing to GDP per capita. An overall explanatory power of the model for the EU countries exceeds 0.45 (R-squared). The most influential factor is the quality of water resources. Other important independent variables in the model for the EU member states are biodiversity and air quality.
   The authors argue that it is necessary to incorporate the above-mentioned environmental factors into the updated version of the Human Development Index as the most appropriate indicators of sustainable development. Consequently, the weights of the components should be recalculated to improve management of the non-financial risks on macrolevel, facilitating the blended value creation process.

AB  - Data from silage maize variety trials of the years 1999-2010 in the Central German dry region were subjected to a secondary analysis using methods of mathematical statistics:
   With the phenological ripeness indicators (grain dry matter content/TM of the residual plant) the differences in the ripeness dynamics of grain to residual plant and their effects on the economy and ecology compared to the current ripeness system with use-specific ripeness numbers are documented. This dependence on all directions of use in the maize of the environments and varietal types taking into account of the different plasticity of maize varieties is been quantified.
   The achievement of physiological ripening of the grain is the interface of all usage directions and at the same time basis for the comparable, agro-eco-efficient level of maturity (63% TM) in conjunction with the silage ripeness index (SRI of 2.8) by eco-silage maize crops. The specific characteristics of the usage directions are low and with regard to efficiency, environmental and consumer protection discussed.
   With the phenological stage indicator (SRI) can both replaced the DM content of the whole plant as a parameter to the harvest date of silage and energy maize as the usage-specific ripeness numbers to the variety choice for silage and grain maize. A classification of the varieties according to ripeness groups would fully correspond to the environmental maize production. In the preparation of production (breeding, approval, testing and type of election), the SRI serves as selection and during inventory management through differential ripening control in compliance with the environmental and field production conditions as ripeness index.
   The wide ripeness ratio between grain and residual plant is the phenotypic expression of maize varieties as indicator for the agro-eco-efficiency and multifunctional guarantee better plant health, the resource efficiency, as well as basic product safety and sustainability of the process of maize silage.
   A precise fixing of harvest time point (HTP) is possible only with the SRI. The correct HTP is in principle maximum possible SRI. This HTP differently from the silage optimum can be according to the environments and the type of election. Ideally a maximum high SRI of 2.9 and over to a high basic intake of ground feed when reaching for exclusive maize silage feeding ruminant more friendly, better structural efficiency and grain hardness for the bypass of starch in the small intestine.
   The variety and the harvest strategy are to focus their reasons of economy and ecology on a high proportion of stocks ripeness in the field of silage optimum (SRI > 2.6) reach. Standard for maximum efficiency of production process maize and its environmental and consumer protection in the field of view of social line is the reaching of the agro eco-efficient ripeness point (SRI of 2.8 at physiological ripeness of grain by 63%).

AB  - The state of marine ecosystems is increasingly evaluated using indicators. The indicator assessment results need to be understood in the context of the whole ecosystem in order to understand the key factors determining the status of these environmental components. Data available from the system's different components are, however, often heterogeneous: they may represent different spatial and temporal scales, and different parameters can be measured with different accuracy. This makes it difficult to evaluate the relationship between these variables and status of the environment using indicators. We studied whether probabilistic, machine learning-based classifiers could provide for assessing the relationships between multiple environmental factors and ecological indicators. This paper demonstrates the use of Bayesian network classifiers (Tree-augmented Naive Bayes classifier, TAN as the specific case example), used together with structural learning from data and Entropy Minimization Discretization (IEMD) algorithm to study environment-indicator relationships within coastal fish communities in the Baltic Sea. By using two Baltic-wide indicators of coastal fish community status and a heterogeneous set of potentially influential natural and anthropogenic variables, we explore and discuss the potential of the approach. Given pre-defined cutting points for the indicators, such as the classification thresholds of the indicator, the method enables identifying relevant variables and estimating their relative importance. This information could be used in environmental management to demonstrate at which threshold value the state of an indicator is likely to respond to a pressure or a combination of pressures. In contrast to many other multivariate statistical methodologies, the presented approach can handle missing data as well as data of varying types, from fully quantitative to presence-absence, in the same analysis.

AB  - Soil enzymatic activities and basal respiration are two important bio-indicators of soil quality and are closely related to soil fertility and sustainable crop growth. We collected soil samples from four long-term experimental stations of China differing both geographically and climatically - Shenyang Agro-Ecological Experimental Station (brown soil), Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station (fluvo-aquic soil), Taoyuan Agro-Ecological Experimental Station (paddy soil) and Qiyang Red Soil Experimental Station (red soil) - to investigate the effect of long-term application of chemical fertilizer and/or organic manure on soil enzymatic activities and basal respiration. In general, soil enzymatic activities and basal respiration increased in soils with long-term application of chemical fertilizers and manures, especially organic manure. Among stations, soil enzymatic activities were not consistently increased with organic manure alone (e.g. the sucrase and phosphatase activities in the paddy soil from Taoyuan and red soil from Qiyang). As well, soil enzymatic activities were characterized by distinct zonality. Soil cellulase and urease activity were the two main indicators of soil fertility as evaluated by principal component analysis. Regression analysis of the major abiotic factor(s) influencing enzyme activity revealed a dependence on the specific enzyme tested and the activity of specific soil enzymes depended on the location of the experimental station. Environmental factors, mainly soil temperature, moisture and pH, as well as soil texture, should be taken into account in evaluating the effects of long-term fertilization on soil biological activity and soil fertility in field experimental stations differing geographically and climatically.

AB  - The Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) provided the first statistically sound Summary of the ecological condition of streams and small rivers in the US. Information provided in the assessment filled an important gap in meeting the requirements of the US Clean Water Act. The purpose of the WSA was to: 1) report on the ecological condition of all wadeable, perennial streams and rivers within the conterminous US, 2) describe the biological condition of these systems with direct measures of aquatic life, and 3) identify and rank the relative importance of chemical and physical stressors affecting stream and river condition. The assessment included perennial wadeable streams and rivers that accounted for 95% of the length of flowing waters in the US. The US Environmental Protection Agency, states, and tribes collected chemical, physical, and biological data at 1392 randomly selected sites. Nationally, 42% of the length of US streams was in poor condition compared to best available reference sites in their ecoregions, 25% was in fair condition, and 28% was in good condition. Results were reported for 3 major regions: Eastern Highlands, Plains and Lowlands,and West. In the West, 45% of the length of wadeable flowing waters was in good condition. In the Eastern Highlands, only 18% of the length of wadeable streams and rivers was in good condition and 52% was in poor condition. In the Plains and Lowlands, almost 30% of the length of wadeable streams and rivers was in good condition and 40% was in poor condition. The most widespread stressors observed nationally and in each of the 3 major regions were N, P, riparian disturbance, and streambed sediments. Excess nutrients and excess streambed sediments had the highest impact on biological condition; streams scoring poor for these stressors were at 2 to 3X higher risk of having poor biological condition than were streams that scored in the good range for the same stressors.

AB  - Basin hypsometry has long been used as an indicator of stages in landscape evolution. It has also served as a tool for detecting tectonically active regions. Whether hypsometric curve and its integral are independent of differences in basin size and relief has been discussed in many recent studies. The Taiwan Mountain Range, the result of an oblique collision between the Phillipine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate, provides an excellent opportunity to study landscape evolution in relation to steady state conditions. Taking advantage of the space-for-time substitution concerning the building process of Taiwanese mountains, this study sampled major drainage basins for hypsometric analysis, from the southern tip of the island to the northern end. This study found that the area previously known as steady state topography is characterized by 1) the hypsometric integral (HI) close to 0.5, 2) S-shaped hypsometric curves, and 3) normally distributed elevations. The response time required for a drainage basin of various Strahler orders to evolve from exposure of sub-aerial erosion to steady state topography ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 My, and is longer for basins of a higher Strahler order. The HI value of 0.5 for a drainage basin seems critical in terms of landscape evolution. The scale dependence of basin hypsometry is manifested mainly by the fact that HI of basins increases as basin order and/or basin size decreases. This study also found that basin hypsometry is scale independent where topography is in a steady state; scale dependence occurs only when drainage basins are in a non-steady state.

AB  - The literature suggests that the establishment of seed yield potential in cool-season perennial grasses is based on developmental processes that take place before floral induction. The relationship between vegetative plant development to flowering and seed yield can be influenced by numerous factors, such as genotype, stand age, post-harvest regrowth environment, pests, manage ment practices and juvenility. The objectives of our investigations and survey of literature were to identify characteristics of vegetative plant development present before floral induction (autumn regrowth period) that were related to flowering (yield potential) and seed yield (utilization of seed yield potential). The number of fertile tillers present at anthesis is a function of the number and developmental state (or biological age) of vegetative tillers present prior to floral induction. The number and size of vegetative tillers before induction was correlated with flowering and seed yield in young stands of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) (r = 0.93 and 0.95 for first-year stands of orchardgrass and tall fescue, respectively), but older stands did not exhibit this relationship. The basal diameter of vegetative tillers in autumn was related to flowering and seed yield in young stands of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and creeping red fescue (F. rubra L.). As stands aged, basal diameter was not a primary indicator of subsequent flowering and seed yield. Tiller height at the end of the regrowth period was consistently related to flowering and seed yield in Kentucky bluegrass (r = -0.81, P < 0.01) and creeping red fescue (r = -0.87, P<0.01), regardless of stand age. Increasing the rhizome:root ratio caused reduction of flowering in creeping red fescue. Vegetative characteristics were not related to flowering and seed production in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and dryland bentgrass (Agrostis castellana Boiss. and Reut.). Green leaf number was a poor indicator of flowering and seed yield potential in all species tested. Ethylene production during autumn vegetative development has been implicated as a potential cause of reduced flowering in creeping red fescue. As much as 92% of the seed yield potential in several cool-season perennial grasses is set before the onset of conditions favouring vernalization of the crop. An increased understanding of developmental gateways in the formation of flowering and seed yield potential may be key to enhancing the economic and environmental sustainability of seed production enterprises.

AB  - Research in urban ecology has recently focused on the field of ecological security. Ecological security should be assessed at different scales, from global (to understand some processes of global change) to regional (to understand processes in specific areas) to urban (to consider the processes of urban development). Remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GISs) are widely utilized in ecological security evaluation, with remotely sensed images applied to determine the structure and quantitative indicators of urban ecological systems and GIS to manipulate, analyse, and visualize multisource information in urban ecology. This article focuses on urban ecological security assessment based on multitemporal RS information and GIS. As a case study, the changes in spatial patterns of urban ecological security in Xuzhou City are evaluated during its transformation from a coal mining industrial city to a modern one with decreasing mining production. The popular 'pressure-state-response' conceptual model is used to construct an evaluation framework according to geographical properties and data availability. A hierarchical weighted model is adopted to take different factors into account and determine the state of ecological security in the study area. Using Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) images as the main RS data source, the derived parameters, such as vegetation index, urban thermal information, and landscape pattern, are integrated to depict the structure and properties of the urban ecological system. Other ancillary information, including mining pressure, water pollution pressure, population density, and ecological flexibility are collected and managed by ArcGIS. The GIS is then used to manage ecological factors derived from remotely sensed data, statistical reports, and geographical data, to evaluate and analyse urban ecological security, and to generate quantitative evaluation and spatial patterns of ecological security. The resulting maps of urban ecological security situations in 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, and 2007 are analysed in both temporal and spatial dimensions. By analysing urban ecological security in both temporal and spatial dimensions, it is concluded that the ecological security of Xuzhou City is under increasing pressure. Influenced by the pressure of urbanization and mining industry development, the unsafe areas of Xuzhou City have greatly expanded, and with accelerating speed. Finally, suggestions for improving urban ecological security are provided.

AB  - The impact of climate change on the dynamics of populations has been well documented and is widespread. However, weather variability influences populations both directly and indirectly, and is mediated by species interactions. This complexity may impede proper climate impact assessments. Hence, predicting the consequences of climate change may require including processes that occur both with time lags and across trophic levels. Based on our current understanding of the mechanisms linking local climate and trophic interactions in tundra ecosystems, we used a state-space formulation of a mediation model that allowed for assessing the relative contribution of direct and indirect environmental (weather and trophic) effects on reindeer Rangifer tarandus reproductive success. Our study showed that the mediator effect of body condition caused delayed but predictable effects of weather, plant productivity, and reindeer densities on reproductive success. Furthermore, these predictors also affected reproductive success directly and with the same sign, suggesting that direct and indirect effects pulled in the same direction with respect to their combined total effect on reproductive success. Hence, poor weather conditions not only affect calf production negatively the same year, but also increase the likelihood of poor reproductive success the subsequent year. The results support the expectation that calf slaughter mass (as a proxy for herd body condition) is an important indicator of the state of reindeer herds with respect to their production potential and resilience to weather events and climate change. Finally, the model framework employed in the present study can be further developed as a potential vehicle for near-term forecasting, and thereby constitutes a useful tool for adaptive management.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the morphological, physical, and chemical properties of Histosols in wetlands and to infer aspects related to their pedogenesis based on C and N isotopes and C-14 dating to better understand ecosystem services, paleo-environments, and post-depositional processes based on preliminary results. Two Histosol pedons, located in different floodplains that refer to different sedimentation environments, were sampled in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Morphological, physical, and chemical characterization were performed, and the total C and N content of the substrate and the C content of humic substances were assessed. Elemental C and N and isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were performed every 10 cm, while C-14 dating of the humin fraction was performed at 40-50 and 190-200 cm. The interproxy approach combining pedological analyses, radiocarbon dating, and elemental and isotopic analyses of total C and N of organic matter, showed a mixture of algae and continental\terrestrial organic matter deposited in peatlands, over the last similar to 4000 cal years before present (BP). The studied soils were formed by geogenic and pedogenic processes (terrestrialization, paludization, and aggradation). Considering the relationships between delta C-13 and delta N-15, between C/N and delta C-13, and the soil characteristics, these deposits were probably formed by vertical accretion in lake environments. However, near 2300 cal yr BP, the radiocarbon dating and isotopic analyses suggest the occurrence of deposition of alluvial sediments transported by the Surui River in RJ-01. It is likely that the modern age obtained by C-14 dating in RJ-02, near 3600 cal yr BP, is probably due to the intense bioturbation by plant roots and the input of young material during the seasonal flood period.

AB  - Seabirds are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because they integrate across changes in the lower trophic levels and the physical environment. Signals from this key group of species can indicate broad scale impacts or response to environmental change. Recent studies of penguin populations, the most commonly abundant Antarctic seabirds in the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea, have demonstrated that physical changes in Antarctic marine environments have profound effects on biota at high trophic levels. Large populations of the circumpolar-breeding Adelie penguin occur in East Antarctica, but direct, standardized population data across much of this vast coastline have been more limited than in other Antarctic regions. We combine extensive new population survey data, new population estimation methods, and re-interpreted historical survey data to assess decadal-scale change in East Antarctic Adelie penguin breeding populations. We show that, in contrast to the west Antarctic Peninsula and western Ross Sea where breeding populations have decreased or shown variable trends over the last 30 years, East Antarctic regional populations have almost doubled in abundance since the 1980's and have been increasing since the earliest counts in the 1960's. The population changes are associated with five-year lagged changes in the physical environment, suggesting that the changing environment impacts primarily on the pre-breeding age classes. East Antarctic marine ecosystems have been subject to a number of changes over the last 50 years which may have influenced Adelie penguin population growth, including decadal-scale climate variation, an inferred mid-20th century sea-ice contraction, and early-to-mid 20th century exploitation of fish and whale populations.

AB  - The methodological approaches to the insurance against environmental risks are analyzed in the article. The methodology of environmental risk assessment, the methodical bases of the insurance of quality of land resources of agricultural producers to improve environmental safety at the regional level are justified. The paper provides for the assessment of environmental risks by means of the integral indicator of environmental hazard W-j, taking into account the indicators characterizing the quantitative parameters of the risk of violation of standard conditions of the ecosystem operation. The key indicators of hazard of the region are defined, and the environmental risk in the territory of Ukraine is analyzed. It has been proven that the application of the methodology of environmental risk assessment and analysis enables to determine the top-priority goals of the regional development strategy, to justify a risk level acceptable for the regions, to optimize the strategy of ensuring natural and technogenic safety of the regions, to conduct the territory zoning according to the degree of internal threat to life. The insurance reserve fund for the conservation and recovery of soil fertility is calculated on the example of Sumy Region (Ukraine) in order to improve the environmental safety of agricultural production. The need for environmental insurance as an effective way to minimize possible losses of the insured associated with the consequences of adverse accidental and catastrophic events to improve the regional environmental safety is proved.

AB  - The steady-state flow behavior serves as an important indicator of a natural circulation system, since it directly reflects the flow and heat transfer capacity of the system. Many studies have been conducted into the steady-state behavior of high-pressure natural circulation, while a few have focused on the open natural circulation. The steady-state flow behavior of the open natural circulation is however more complex due to its low-pressure property, which increases the likelihood of flashing. The position of flashing front and the distribution of void fraction in the riser are never fixed. Furthermore, due to the nonlinear characteristic of flashing and nonzero integral result of accelerated pressure drop along the loop direction, it is difficult to obtain an accurate mathematical expression of the relationship between flowrate and heating rate by using the integral of momentum conservation equations. Therefore, relevant theoretical formulations are inadequate and unavailable. In this paper, a theoretical formula to determine the steady-state flow behavior of a flashing-driven natural circulation system was derived by using a quasi-linear flashing mode and a special formula processing of accelerated pressure drop integral result. The prediction results of the formula were validated by experimental data. Furthermore, the influence of geometric and thermal-hydraulic parameters on the steady-state flow behavior was studied through calculation and validated by experimental data. This paper aims at providing technical support for the design of open natural circulation systems.

AB  - Changes in non-invasive stress biomarkers were studied in shaded (n = 8) and non-shaded (n = 8) Holstein bull calves exposed to extreme heat load conditions in a continental region. Ambient temperature and humidity data were recorded for the S and NS hutch and exercise pen environments. Temperature-humidity-index (THI) was also calculated. Respiratory rate, rectal temperature, heart rate, and the root mean square of successive differences between R-R intervals (RMSSD) were recorded as animal-based indicators during three periods: (1) day 1, control day, during which all calves were shaded for 24 h (shade removal from non-shaded calves at 2400 h); (2) day 2, heat stress day, with shade over shaded calves; and (3) days 3-5, post-stress period, with shade over shaded calves. On the heat stress day, the maximum temperatures were 44.3 and 46.7 A degrees C for the non-shaded hutch and pen environments, respectively. The temperatures were with 6.2 and 6.9 A degrees C (P = 0.015 and P = 0.008) and the THIs were with 5.9 and 4.2 units higher (P = 0.020 and P = 0.032) in the non-shaded than in the shaded environment for the hutch and exercise pen, respectively. Shaded calves had with 42.3 +/- 3.2 breaths/min higher respiratory rate than non-shaded ones on the heat stress day at 1200 h (P = 0.001), which was moderated to 20.1 +/- 2.4 breaths/min at 1600 h (P = 0.023). Significant differences in respiratory rate occurred earlier than in any other animal-based parameter between shaded and non-shaded calves on day 2. The only significant group difference in rectal temperature was found at 1200 h on day 2 when THI exceeded 91 units, with 0.59 A degrees C higher values for non-shaded calves (P = 0.045). The heart rate on days 2 and 3 was higher for non-shaded calves than for shaded ones. Group differences were also significant at 0800 h (18.2 +/- 1.2 beats/min, P = 0.008), 1200 h (22.3 +/- 1.4 beats/min, P = 0.003), 1600 h (15.3 +/- 0.8 beats/min, P = 0.012), and 2000 h (19.0 +/- 1.1 beats/min, P = 0.010) on day 2. Following a rapid daytime reduction, RMSSD showed a nighttime overcompensation in non-shaded calves on day 3 (between 0000 and 0600 h) and day 4 (between 0000 and 0800 h), exceeding the levels recorded on day 1 (control) and the levels for shaded calves, thus suggesting a recovery of the autonomic nervous system from heat stress. Based on our results, shading effectively reduced heat stress as evidenced by heart rate and RMSSD in addition to traditional measures of heat stress. Respiratory rate and heart rates exhibited by non-shaded calves support that the well-being of pre-weaned calves can be impaired in continental regions during following a heat stress day without providing shade.

AB  - Hong Kong has enjoyed more than 20 years of almost uninterrupted economic growth and the territory is widely recognized as one of the most successful of the newly industrializing economies. Economic success has, however, brought with it a variety of environmental problems including deterioration of air and water bodies and the loss of terrestrial and marine habitats. Environmental degradation also poses a serious threat to local biodiversity. Despite its stated commitment to environmental protection, the Kong Kong Government is still strongly growth-oriented and the territory's environmental institutions and policies often seem ineffective in resolving the conflicts that arise between development and the environment.
   To illustrate some of the contradictions inherent in Hong Kong's current approach to environmental and conservation issues, this paper focuses on the controversy surrounding the fate of the local population of the Indo-Pacific humped-back dolphin, or, as it is locally known, the Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis). The dolphin's habitat has been disrupted by major development projects, marine pollution and fishing and shipping activity. It is possible that the species will be extinct in Kong Kong waters by the beginning of the next century. The paper examines the background to the controversy that has arisen surrounding the future of the dolphins and evaluates the Government's attempts to develop a conservation strategy to protect them. The preferred option-the creation of a dolphin sanctuary within a designated marine park area-has been strongly criticized by some local marine biologists and conservationists as being inadequate and inappropriate. The failure to address effectively the problems faced by the Chinese white dolphin may be attributed to the lack of an overall conservation strategy in Hong Kong, shortcomings in the territory's environmental impact assessment system and limited local scientific knowledge concerning the dolphin population.

AB  - Wetlands are major sources of various ecological goods and services including storage and distribution of water in space and time which help in ensuring the availability of surface and groundwater throughout the year. However, there still remains a poor understanding of the range of values of water quality parameters that occur in wetlands either in its impacted state or under natural conditions. It was thus imperative to determine the health of Lunyangwa wetland in Mzuzu City in Malawi in order to classify and determine its state. This study used the Escom's Wetland Classification and Risk Assessment Index Field Guide to determine the overall characteristics of Lunyangwa wetland and to calculate its combined Wetland Index Score. Data on site information, field measurements (i.e. EC, pH, temperature and DO) and physical characteristics of Lunyangwa wetland were collected from March, 2013 to February, 2014. Results indicate that Lunyangwa wetland is a largely open water zone which is dominated by free-floating plants on the water surface, beneath surface and emergent in substrate. Furthermore, the wetland can be classified as of a C ecological category (score = 60-80%), which has been moderately modified with moderate risks of the losses and changes occurring in the natural habitat and biota in the wetland. It was observed that the moderate modification and risk were largely because of industrial, agricultural, urban/social catchment stressors on the wetland. This study recommends an integrated and sustainable management approach coupled with continuous monitoring and evaluation of the health of the wetland for all stakeholders in Mzuzu City. This would help to maintain the health of Lunyangwa wetland which is currently at risk of being further modified due to the identified catchment stressors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring small-scale fisheries (SSFs) is challenging due to the limited information available and their underlying socioeconomic characteristics. This constitutes a serious impediment to assess the compliance level of Aichi Biodiversity Targets (ABT). The European Union has committed itself to include an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in its Common Fisheries Policy. EAFM depends on suites of indicators that track the pressure exercised, the state of the ecosystem, and the socio-economic consequences of management objectives. Therefore, The Living Planet Index (LPI) is proposed here for describing the performance of SSF towards the ABT. We show that the LPI can be reformulated to track trends in Fishing Effort (LPIFE), trends in Fish Populations (LPIFP), and both the state and trends related to the contribution of fisheries to broader society (LPIDEB). The implementation of the LPI in SSF applies several principles of the EAFM, including decentralization, fishers participation, and consideration of local knowledge. In this paper, we used 10-year daily data from the Cofradia at Palamos port, Catalonia-Spain. This is a multi-species SSF landing ca. 130 species, from which 10.9% are of special interest, being listed by the IUCN or in agreements by regional conventions. We observe a decreasing trend in the LPIFP, the LPIFE, and in the LPIDEB, including 36 species or groups, accounting for 90% of total landings, suggesting an overall decrease in the sustainability of this SSF. We conclude that use of the LPIFP is especially well suited to standardize the reporting of information for multispecies fisheries using a wide array of fishing strategies, and results strongly suggest the feasibility of using the LPI methodology to standardize reporting of any given agreed fisheries indicator in order enhance management towards the ABTs.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that the rotational dynamics in crystals of molecular gyroscopes become more favorable (i.e., faster) when the packing coefficient of the corresponding lattice is decreased by increasing the steric bulk of the stator, as expected for structures with high protuberances or deep cavities. In an effort to explore the effects of increased stator size on the solid-state dynamics of these crystalline models for molecular machines, molecular gyroscope 4 with an "exploded" bis(tri(meta-terphenyOmethyl) stator was synthesized. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a packing structure with two crystallographically distinct gyroscope molecules and four ethyl acetate molecules per unit cell. Although a relatively low packing coefficient of 0.68 was determined for the corresponding packing motif, we noticed that rotators at the two sites have significantly different environments. The solid state rotational dynamics of the two central phenylenes in an ethyl acetate clathrate of 4 were explored by variable-temperature C-13 NMR with cross-polarization with magic angle spinning (C-13 CPMAS NMR) and by quadrupolar echo H-2 NMR measurements with isotopically labeled samples. It was found that the increased stator size does indeed allow for more free-volume and faster rotational dynamics as compared to molecular gyroscopes with smaller or more globular stators. However, the two crystallographic sites experience different rotational dynamics, suggesting that the average density available from the packing coefficient is a very crude indicator of solid-state dynamics.

AB  - Successful conservation of ecosystems and ecosystem services requires understanding the structural-functional relationships underlying resilience to disturbance pressures. State-and-transition models (STMs) are box-and-arrow diagrams conceptualizing system resilience, but many STMs lack functional descriptions. For a cattle-grazed sagebrush steppe ecosystem in northwestern Colorado, we aimed to update an existing STM by incorporating functional descriptions of the states to inform future hypotheses. In this STM, a diverse set of native perennial understory plants define a Diverse state, but long-term exclusion of disturbances to sagebrush results in a shift to a Depauperate state with increased bare ground interspaces and sagebrush dominance. We hypothesized that herbaceous species were inferior competitors to sagebrush over the long term for soil nitrogen. To examine evidence for this hypothesis, develop functional descriptions of the Diverse and Depauperate states, and identify more specific hypotheses for future studies, we measured the following: the mass, C:N, and distribution of the litter layer; nitrogen mineralization rates; nitrate pools; and soil attributes on plots classified as Diverse (n=5) or Depauperate (n=5). Plots in the Depauperate state had similar to 20% higher soil bulk density, half the clay and soil moisture concentrations, and 30% lower percent soil nitrogen compared to Diverse state plots; litter layer patchiness was nearly three times greater on the Depauperate plots than on the Diverse plots, but there was no significant difference between states in mean litter layer mass or C:N. We detected no significant differences between states in nitrogen mineralization rates or nitrate pools. This may be due to our sampling design, which examined nitrogen transformation at the plot level rather than at microsites within the plots, or it may be that another resource such as soil moisture is more limiting than nitrogen. Differences in soil texture between plots in the Diverse and Depauperate states may indirectly influence the competitive interactions between sagebrush and native herbaceous understory by controlling available soil resources. These results suggest that the vulnerability of sagebrush steppe ecosystems to state changes may be dependent on soil texture, which is highly variable across this broadly distributed ecosystem. Based on these insights, we present a revised STM and propose future work.

AB  - Humans experience climate variability and climate change primarily through changes in weather at local and regional scales. One of the most effective means to track these changes is through detailed analysis of meteorological data. In this work, monthly and seasonal trends in recent winter climate of the northeastern United States (NE-US) are documented. Snow cover and snowfall are important components of the region's hydrological systems, ecosystems, infrastructure, travel safety, and winter tourism and recreation. Temperature, snowfall, and snow depth data were collected from the merged United States Historical Climate Network (USHCN) and National Climatic Data Center Cooperative Network (COOP) data set for the months of December through March, 1965-2005. Monthly and seasonal time series of snow-covered days (snow depth >2.54 cm) are constructed from daily snow depth data. Spatial coherence analysis is used to address data quality issues with daily snowfall and snow depth data, and to remove stations with nonclimatic influences from the regional analysis. Monthly and seasonal trends in mean, minimum, and maximum temperature, total snowfall, and snow-covered days are evaluated over the period 1965-2005, a period during which global temperature records and regional indicators exhibit a shift to warmer climate conditions. NE-US regional winter mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures are all increasing at a rate ranging from 0.42 degrees to 0.46 degrees C/decade with the greatest warming in all three variables occurring in the coldest months of winter (January and February). The regional average reduction in number of snow-covered days in winter (-8.9 d/decade) is also greatest during the months of January and February. Further analysis with additional regional climate modeling is required to better investigate the causal link between the increases in temperature and reduction in snow cover during the coldest winter months of January and February. In addition, regionally averaged winter snowfall has decreased by about 4.6 cm/decade, with the greatest decreases in snowfall occurring in December and February. These results have important implications for the impacts of regional climate change on the northeastern United States hydrology, natural ecosystems, and economy.

AB  - Our objective was to use stable carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope ratios of the adductor muscles of cultured Crassostrea gigas to typify the trophic state of temperate coastal ecosystems. Young oysters were introduced on a regional geographical scale in 8 locations along the coast of Normandy (France) and sampled after 9 mo in cultivation. Food sources were also investigated using a mixing model based on food source isotopic composition data previously obtained. To strengthen the interpretation of trophic ecosystem functioning, values of stable isotope ratios were combined with environmental variables in a principal component analysis (PCA). Isotopic values of adductor muscles varied significantly between -19.94 and -17.26 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and between 7.73 and 12.14 parts per thousand for delta N-15. PCA discriminated 2 groups of coastal ecosystems that differed in coastal hydrology, inputs of nutrients, and size of their respective watersheds. Our results suggest that isotopic signature differences between these 2 spatial groups appeared too important to be due to (1) variations in the isotopic ratios of food sources and (2) differing trophic step fractionation between locations, These differences are more probably linked with differences in oyster diets. Finally, we conclude that cultured C. gigas is a useful spatial bio-indicator of coastal ecosystem trophic functioning in temperate ecosystems and an interesting biological model for the determination of isotopic baselines.

AB  - Restoration of the Florida Everglades, a substantial wetland ecosystem within the United States, is one of the largest ongoing restoration projects in the world. Decision-makers and managers within the Everglades ecosystem rely on ecological models forecasting indicator wildlife response to changes in the management of water flows within the system. One such indicator of ecosystem health, the presence of wading bird communities on the landscape, is currently assessed using three species distribution models that assume perfect detection and report output on different scales that are challenging to compare against one another. We sought to use current advancements in species distribution modeling to improve models of Everglades wading bird distribution. Using a joint species distribution model that accounted for imperfect detection, we modeled the presence of nine species of wading bird simultaneously in response to annual hydrologic conditions and landscape characteristics within the Everglades system. Our resulting model improved upon the previous model in three key ways: 1) the model predicts probability of occupancy for the nine species on a scale of 0-1, making the output more intuitive and easily comparable for managers and decision-makers that must consider the responses of several species simultaneously; 2) through joint species modeling, we were able to consider rarer species within the modeling that otherwise are detected in too few numbers to fit as individual models; and 3) the model explicitly allows detection probability of species to be less than 1 which can reduce bias in the site occupancy estimates. These improvements are essential as Everglades restoration continues and managers require models that consider the impacts of water management on key indicator wildlife such as the wading bird community.

AB  - European water policies aim to achieve a good ecological status in all water bodies. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) defined a group of biological elements to assess water quality. In reservoirs and lakes, phytoplankton is the only biological element used for water quality evaluation. However, zooplankton is an important link in the trophic web, since it is able to control the phytoplankton community and was already described as a good bioindicator, with high sensitivity to different environmental stresses. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate the ability of zooplankton communities to be used in the evaluation of water quality in reservoirs. A group of four reservoirs in the north of Portugal (Paradela, Alto Cavado, Alto Rabagao, and Venda Nova) were sampled every three months, during one year, to assess the water quality. Physical and chemical parameters, as well as phytoplankton communities, were studied according to the metrics proposed by the WFD for this typology of water bodies. Additionally, zooplankton communities were also sampled in each reservoir, to understand if their seasonal dynamics are influenced by alterations of the water quality in the reservoirs. Results show that the reservoirs present a good ecological potential, according to WFD reference values for physical and chemical parameters and phytoplankton communities, with occasional drops to moderate ecological potential due to variations in the dissolved O-2 and total phosphorus values. The results observed in the dynamics of zooplankton communities show that this biological element is sensitive to changes in the reservoirs and provides a more detailed image of the state of the ecosystem. Zooplankton communities responded to alterations in the water level in the reservoir, to shifts in the trophic status and in the water quality, both at the taxonomic level and on a functional perspective. Therefore, the metrics proposed by WFD to evaluate water quality in reservoirs seem to be insufficient to understand all the alterations that occur in these aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - In traditional single-species fish stock assessment natural mortality is considered constant, independent of age or size. It is argued that predation mortality is generally related to prey size, that it decreases with increasing size and that such size-specific signals can best be detected in stocks that are close to a virgin state. Size-specific natural mortality rates of westcoast steenbras (Lithognathus aureti) were determined by using length frequencies of rod-caught fish from a lightly exploited and closed population at Meob Bay, Namibia. It was assumed that natural mortality is inversely proportional to (body) length and approaching a constant minimum rate (M-infinity) as the fish grow bigger. Simple and new length-based catch curve methods were developed using the traditional simplification of neglecting variations in length at age. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters for annual mean growth as well as the coefficient of variation of length at age were estimated from analyzing age-length data. A simple deterministic simulation model was developed to examine the robustness of the methods and the impact of variability in individual growth. The model assumes that fish grow with a constant coefficient of variation in length at age. The simple method works within 10% precision criteria in most real cases. It is shown that overestimating mean length at old ((L) over bar(infinity)) counteracts the effects of overlapping lengths for consecutive age groups. This fact can be used to estimate fundamental mortality-to-growth ratio (M-infinity/K) without any prior knowledge on growth. The application of M-infinity for steenbras to obtain size-specific natural mortality rate for silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus), as an input parameter for virtual population analysis, is also proposed.

AB  - The article prents an assessment of the patterns of recovery of oil-polluted ecosystems based on the use of soil science methods, soil enzymology, microbiology, metagenomic analysis, soil zoology and geobotany. The dynamics of vegetation in the experimental remediation plots for the 17-year recovery period is analyzed. An original approach to the bio-diagnostics of ecosystems with oil pollution is proposed - the application of the concept of plant life strategies by Ramensky-Grime. It is shown that the use of this method, along with the traditional geobotanical methods, allows us to give an integrated assessment of the state of vegetation during recovery successions after oil pollution.
   For the first time, an attempt was made to use the data of metagenomic analysis in the diagnostics of the state of oil-polluted soils in the European Subarctic. The indicative significance of acidobacteria and ascomycetes was revealed. Trophic groups of soil microorganisms (ammonifiers, nitrificators, oligonitrophils, oil-oxidizing microorganisms) and soil invertebrates are represented as indicator taxa. Taxonomic groups of microarthropods acting as biomarkers of succession stages were presented: larvae of Diptera and mesostigmatic mites at the first stage, colletnbola at the second stage, and oribatid mites at the third stage. In the ex situ remediation model of peat soil, it was shown the informational content of cellulose and urease activity in terms of oil contamination. The complex of parameters observed characterize the state of biota in areas with oil pollution and can be recommended for determining the effectiveness of remediation methods.

AB  - The aim of this work is to verify the organic and inorganic contamination in Araca Bay, which contains one of the last remnants of mangrove forest on the northern coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, to improve the environmental management of this area, which is part of the Marine Protected Area of the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State (APAMLN) and the Environmental Protected Area of the Alcatrazes Municipality (APAMA). Surface sediments were analyzed to provide information on the levels, spatial trends and sources of trace elements, aliphatic hydrocarbons (All), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and fecal steroids. Low levels of trace elements were observed, and the enrichment factors showed no evidence of contamination in the area. The highest concentrations of all organic contaminants were recorded in the samples collected in the external sublittoral stations, mainly in the Sao Sebastiao Channel, which had the finest grain sizes and higher OC contents. With the exception of the samples collected in the inner part of the bay, most of the samples presented unresolved complex mixtures (UCM) of AH, which are indicators of petroleum and its derivative inputs. PAH concentrations were higher in the external stations, but the levels were below the limits of the sediment quality guidelines (SQG) recommended in Brazilian federal legislation on dredged sediments. The major sources of these compounds were from pyrolytic sources. Sewage contamination was detected mainly in the inner part of the bay, especially near the northern stream and the sewage outfall. The contaminant distributions were related to the hydrodynamics of the intertidal flat, with the most central dynamic areas presenting lower contaminant levels.

AB  - A 370,000-year paleoecological history of fire spanning four glacial cycles provides evidence of plant migration in response to And,an climate change. Charcoal, an indicator of fire, is only occasionally observed in this record, whereas it is ubiquitous in Holoccoc-aged Andean records. Fire is a transformative agent in Amazonian and Andcan vegetation but is shown to be rare in nature. As humans promote fire, fire-free areas become microrefugia for fire-sensitive species. A distinction is drawn between microrefugia resulting from fire-free zones and those caused by unusual climatic conditions. The importance of this distinction lies in the lack of warmer-than-modern microrefugia aiding upslope migration in response to warming, whereas fire-free microrefugia support tree species above modern tree line or in areas of Amazonia least used by humans. The synergy between fire, deforestation, and climate change could promote a state-change in the ecosystem, one where new microrefugia would be needed to maintain biodiversity. Past tipping points are identified to have occurred within ca. 1 degrees C-1.5 degrees C of modem conditions. The recent climatic instability in both Amazonia and the Andes is viewed in the context of ecological flickering, while the drought-induced and fire-induced tree mortality are aspects of critical slowing down; both possibly portending an imminent tipping point.

AB  - Changes in rainfall associated with climate change are expected to affect the tightly coupled water-carbon ecosystem dynamics. Here, we study the effects of altered rainfall at 33 sites in North America, as projected by the high-resolution/high-fidelity (similar to 4 km, 1 hr) continental-wide Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) convection-permitting model under a high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5). We make use of a stochastic weather generator to extend WRF outputs, accounting for natural variability and simultaneously separate the changes in total rainfall, its seasonality, and its intraseasonal pattern. We used these rainfall scenarios to study ecosystem responses with the state-of-the-art Tethys-Chloris terrestrial biosphere model. Model simulations suggest that increases in mean annual rainfall dominate ecosystem responses at dry sites, while wet sites are less sensitive to rainfall changes. Sites of intermediate wetness face reductions in productivity, due to reduced growing season rainfall and increased water losses under altered seasonality, which outpace any possible benefits induced by increases in mean annual totals. Changes in the fine-scale temporal structure of rainfall have an insignificant impact on ecosystem productivity and only alter hydrological dynamics, contradicting expectations based on some field experiments, which, however, are not tailored to directly quantify climate change impacts, but rather to understand the mechanisms leading to ecosystem responses. We further demonstrate how approaches following the "fewer but larger rainfall events" concept might exacerbate ecosystem responses.

AB  - Currently, a variety of models are available for predicting the uptake, translocation, and elimination of organic contaminants by plants. These models range from simple deterministic risk assessment screening tools to more complex models that consider physical, chemical, and biological processes in a mechanistic manner. This study evaluates the performance of a range of such models and model types against experimental data sets. Three dynamic, three regression-based, and three steady-state and equilibrium models have been selected for evaluation. These models differ in terms of their scope, methodological approach, and complexity. Data from nine published experiments were used to create scenarios to test model performance. These experiments consider plant contamination via both soil and aerial exposure pathways. A total of 19 different organic chemicals were used in the experiments along with 7 different plant species. Model predictions of chemical concentrations in the relevant plant compartments were compared with the experimentally recorded values. The results indicate that dynamic models offer performance advantages for acute exposure durations and for rapidly changing environmental media. Equilibrium/steady-state and regression-based models perform better for chronic exposure durations, where stable conditions are more likely to exist. The selection of an appropriate plant uptake model will therefore be dependent on the requirements of the assessment, the nature of the environmental media, and the duration of the source term. The results generated by the regression-based models suggest that in their current form these models are unsuitable for evaluating the uptake of organic chemicals from the air into plants.

AB  - In this paper, we describe an exploited continental shelf ecosystem (Gulf of Gabes) in the southern Mediterranean Sea using an Ecopath mass-balance model. This allowed us to determine the structure and functioning of this ecosystem and assess the impacts of fishing upon it. The model represents the average state of the ecosystem between 2000 and 2005. It includes 41 functional groups, which encompass the entire trophic spectrum from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels (e.g., fishes, birds, and mammals), and also considers the fishing activities in the area (five fleets). Model results highlight an important bentho-pelagic coupling in the system due to the links between plankton and benthic invertebrates through detritus. A comparison of this model with those developed for other continental shelf regions in the Mediterranean (i.e., the southern Catalan, the northern-central Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Seas) emphasizes similar patterns in their trophic functioning. Low and medium trophic levels (i.e., zooplanlcton, benthic molluscs, and polychaetes) and sharks were identified as playing key ecosystem roles and were classified as keystone groups. An analysis of ecosystem attributes indicated that the Gulf of Gabes is the least mature (i.e., in the earliest stages of ecosystem development) of the four ecosystems that were compared and it is suggested that this is due, at least in part, to the impacts of fishing. Bottom trawling was identified as having the widest-ranging impacts across the different functional groups and the largest impacts on some commercially-targeted demersal fish species. Several exploitation indices highlighted that the Gulf of Gabes ecosystem is highly exploited, a finding which is supported by stock assessment outcomes. This suggests that it is unlikely that the gulf can be fished at sustainable levels, a situation which is similar to other marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Widespread concern over the state of the environment and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem services and functions has highlighted the need for high-quality, long-term datasets for detecting and understanding environmental change. In July 2001, an international conference reviewed progress in the field of long-term ecosystem research and monitoring (LTERM). Examples are given which demonstrate the need for long-term environmental monitoring and research, for palaeoecological reconstructions of past environments and for applied use of historical records that inform us of past environmental conditions. LTERM approaches are needed to provide measures of baseline conditions and for informing decisions on ecosystem management and environmental policy formulation. They are also valuable in aiding the understanding of the processes of environmental change, including the integrated effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers and pressures, recovery from stress and resilience of species, populations, communities and ecosystems. The authors argue that, in order to realise the full potential of LTERM approaches, progress must be made in four key areas: (i) increase the number, variety and scope of LTERM activities to help define the operational range of ecosystems; (ii) greater integration of research, monitoring, modelling, palaeoecological reconstruction and remote sensing to create a broad-scale early warning system of environmental change; (iii) development of inter-disciplinary approaches which draw upon social and environmental science expertise to understand the factors determining the vulnerability and resilience of the nature-society system to change; and (iv) more and better use of LTERM data and information to inform the public and policymakers and to provide guidance on sustainable development.

AB  - An operational three-dimensional oil spill model is developed by the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC), State Oceanic Administration, China, and the model has been running for 9 a. On June 4 and 17, 2011, oil is spilled into the sea water from two separate oil platforms in the Bohai Bay, i.e., Platforms B and C of Penglai 19-3 oilfield. The spill causes pollution of thousands of square kilometres of sea area. The NMEFC's oil spill model is employed to study the Penglai 19-3 oil-spill pollution during June to August 2011. The wind final analysis data of the NMEFC, which is based on a weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, are analyzed and corrected by comparing with the observation data. A corrected current filed is obtained by forcing the princeton ocean model (POM) with the corrected wind field. With the above marine environmental field forcing the oil spill model, the oil mass balance and oil distribution can be produced. The simulation is validated against the observation, and it is concluded that the oil spill model of the NMEFC is able to commendably simulate the oil spill distribution. Thus the NMEFC's oil spill model can provide a tool in an environmental impact assessment after the event.

AB  - Biological traits offer valuable approaches to understand species distributions and underlying mechanisms. Their use has received a growing interest in marine community ecology, for both fundamental and applied purposes. The need of ecological indicators as part of marine directives and conservation programmes has promoted the use of multiple traits for indicator development, but in a questionable context regarding the state of fundamental developments. Biological Trait Analysis (BTA) is a complex research field, characterised by flexible concepts and applications. In order to enhance the development of relevant marine ecological indicators, this review provides baselines for better theoretical and applied BTA. A compilation of the existing literature reveals that specific topics have dominated the use of multiple traits in marine ecology unlike in freshwater and terrestrial ecology where tests of theories and uses of evolutionary concepts consistently preceded BTA applications. Availability of data sets and analytical techniques seemed to have driven the growing use of marine BTA rather than fundamental questions regarding life history theories in marine ecosystem components and the functional nature of traits. It is therefore suggested that greater focus on life history ecology and on the links between marine species traits and ecosystem functioning are still needed to support trait-based indicator development. Life history strategy understanding is put forward as a theoretically-sound basis and fundamental pre-requisite for trait-based marine indicator development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The mute swan (Cygnus olor) can be considered a representative species of birds associated with the aquatic environment and responding very clearly to changes in the environment. Assuming that the condition of the mute swan population well reflects the state of the environment, this species was used in our research as a bioindicative species. Thus, the aim of our study was to elucidate the association between metal contents in soil samples collected from a habitat of mute swans and element contents in their feathers as well as the levels of biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, oxidatively modified proteins, and total antioxidant capacity in the blood of mute swans living in three agglomerations in coastal areas in the southern part of the Baltic Sea (Pomeranian region, northern Poland). We compared the effects of inhabitation, age, and sex on the ecophysiological accumulation of metals in three wintering populations of the mute swan from coastal areas of northern Poland, i.e., Slupsk, Gdynia, and Sopot. In Slupsk, the anthropogenic pressure was related predominantly to the level of Al and, to a lesser extent, to the content of Rh and Ru. We found maximum levels of lipid peroxidation biomarkers in the blood of the mute swans from Gdynia (38.20 +/- 6.35 nmol MDA center dot mL(-1)). At the same time, maximum levels of aldehydic and ketonic derivatives of oxidatively modified proteins were noted in the blood of swans from Sopot compared to the values obtained in mute swans from Slupsk and Gdynia. This trend suggesting high levels of oxidative stress biomarkers was also confirmed by a decrease in the total antioxidant capacity in these groups.

AB  - Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) have been suggested to harmonize biodiversity monitoring worldwide. Their aim is to provide a small but comprehensive set of monitoring variables that would give a balanced picture of the development of biodiversity and the reaching of international and national biodiversity targets. Globally, GEO BON (Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network) has suggested 22 candidate EBVs to be monitored. In this article we regard EBVs as a conceptual tool that may help in making national scale biodiversity monitoring more robust by pointing out where to focus further development resources. We look at one country-Finland-with a relatively advanced biodiversity monitoring scheme and study how well Finland's current biodiversity state indicators correspond with EBVs. In particular, we look at how national biodiversity monitoring could be improved by using available remote sensing (RS) applications. Rapidly emerging new technologies from drones to airborne laser scanning and new satellite sensors providing imagery with very high resolution (VHR) open a whole new world of opportunities for monitoring the state of biodiversity and ecosystems at low cost. In Finland, several RS applications already exist that could be expanded into national indicators. These include the monitoring of shore habitats and water quality parameters, among others. We hope that our analysis and examples help other countries with similar challenges. Along with RS opportunities, our analysis revealed also some needs to develop the EBV framework itself.

AB  - The monitoring of animal populations is essential for reporting on the state of the environment, with birds often used as indicators of ecosystem health. Traditionally, bird monitoring has been done by field observers; however, there has been recent interest in use of automatic recording devices (ARDs) as an alternative. A monitoring programme managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC), used observers and ARDs concurrently for three survey seasons, providing the opportunity to compare results in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The difference in species-richness estimates from the two methods was small, with the observer method detecting slightly higher numbers of species in all habitat types. Detection probabilities for individual species, derived from occupancy analysis, were similar between methods, with a few exceptions: bellbird (Anthornis melanura), brown creeper (Mohoua novaeseelandiae), tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), North/South Island robin (Petroica longipes/australis), and rifleman (Acanthisitta chloris). Bellbird and rifleman had a higher probability of being detected by ARDs, whilst the remainder were more likely to be detected by observers. Differences in detection probability may be due to identification confusion in the case of bellbird and tui, and observer ability to detect and identify birds visually for brown creeper and North/South Island robin. The relationship between indices of abundance from the observer and ARD methods varied between species and habitat types. These inconsistencies suggested that the ARD results did not correlate closely with observed abundance, which may limit the ARD method to provision of confirmed presence data. Observer counts proved to be more time-efficient given present levels of processing technology, mainly due to the longer processing time required for ARD recordings. However higher numbers of people were required for observer counts, which may be problematic when there is a shortage of appropriately skilled observers at the required time of year.

AB  - The experimental data presented here relate to the question of whether terrestrial ecosystems will sequester more C in their soils, litter and biomass as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise. Similar to our previous study with relatively fertile growth conditions (Korner and Arnone 1992), we constructed four rather nutrient-limited model communities of moist tropical plant species in greenhouses (approximately 7 m(2) each). Plant communities were composed of seven species (77 individuals per community) representing major taxonomic groups and various life forms found in the moist tropics. Two ecosystems were exposed to 340 mu l CO2 l(-1) and two to 610 mu l l(-1) for 530 days of humid tropical growth conditions. In order to permit precise determination of C deposition in the soil, plant communities were initially established in C-free unwashed quartz sand. Soils were then amended with known amounts of organic matter (containing C and nutrients). Mineral nutrients were also supplied over the course of the experiment as timed-release full-balance fertilizer pellets. Soils represented by far the largest repositories for fixed C in all ecosystems. Almost 5 times more C (ca. 80% of net C fixation) was sequestered in the soil than in the biomass, but this did not differ between CO2 treatments. In addition, at the whole-ecosystem level we found a remarkably small and statistically non-significant increase in C sequestration (+4%; the sum of C accretion in the soil, biomass, litter and necromass). Total community biomass more than quadrupled during the experiment, but at harvest was, on average, only 8% greater (i.e. 6% per year; n.s.) under elevated CO2, mainly due to increased root biomass (+15%, P = 0.12). Time courses of leaf area index of all ecosystems suggested that canopy expansion was approaching steady state by the time systems were harvested. Net primary productivity (NPP) of all ecosystems - i.e. annual accumulation of biomass, necromass, and leaf litter (but not plant-derived soil organic matter) - averaged 815 and 910 g m(-2) year(-1) at ambient and elevated CO2, respectively. These NPPs are remarkably similar to those of many natural moist tropical forested ecosystems. At the same time net productivity of soil organic matter reached 7000 g dry matter equivalent per m(2) and year (i.e. 3500 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Very slight yet statistically significant CO2-induced shifts in the abundance of groups of species occurred by the end of the experiment, with one group of species (Elettaria cardamomum, Ficus benjamina, F: pumila, Epipremnum pinnatum) gaining slightly, and another group (Ctenanthe lubbersiana, Heliconia humilis, Cecropia peltata) losing. Our results show that: (1) enormous amounts of C can be deposited in the ground which are normally not accounted for in estimates of NPP and net ecosystem productivity; (2) any enhancement of C sequestration under elevated atmospheric CO2 may be substantially smaller than is believed will occur (yet still very important), especially under growth conditions which permit close to natural NPP; and (3) species dominance in plant communities is likely to change under elevated CO2, but that changes may occur rather slowly.

AB  - Environmental taxes have direct impact on sustainable energy development as energy production and consumption is the major source of GHG and classical pollutants emissions. There are number of EU member states which are using environmental pollution taxes as the main economic instrument of atmospheric air pollution reduction. The energy sector is the main source of atmospheric pollution therefore environmental taxes should have direct impact on sustainable energy development as these taxes create incentives to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and to switch to renewables and cleaner fossil fuels such as natural gas. The comparative study of environmental taxes and indicators of sustainable energy sector development in Baltics and Czech Republic and Slovakia was performed to assess what role environmental taxes are playing in achieving sustainable energy development in selected new EU member states.
   Analysis of environmental taxes in three Baltic States and Czech Republic indicated quite different energy and pollution tax rates as well as quite large differences in the share of environmental tax revenues as percentages of GDP in these countries. Estonia distinguishes with the best results in greening environmental tax system and one of the best results in achieving sustainable energy development targets. Latvia has one of the lowest share of environmental taxes as percentage of GDP and has very high shares of renewables in electricity generation and in final energy consumption however it is more related with favourable climate conditions and well developed hydro power plants.

AB  - As tectonic movements change the valley slope (low-gradient reaches of valleys, in sedimentary basins), the alluvial rivers, as sensitive indicators, respond to these changes, by varying their courses to accommodate this forcing. In our study sinuosity values, a commonly used characteristic parameter to detect river pattern changes, were studied for the major rivers in the Pannonian Basin in order to reveal neotectonic influence on their planform shape. Our study area comprises the entire Pannonian Basin (330,000 km(2)) located in eastern Central-Europe, bounded by the Alps, Carpathians and Dinarides. The studied rivers were mostly in their natural meandering state before the main river regulations of the 19th century. The last quasi-natural, non-regulated river planforms were surveyed somewhat earlier, during the Second Military Survey of the Habsburg Empire. Using the digitized river sections of that survey, the sinuosities of the rivers were calculated with different sample section sizes ranging from 5 km to 80 km. Depending on the bank-full discharge, also a 'most representative' section size is given, which can be connected to the neotectonic activity.
   In total, the meandering reaches of 28 rivers were studied; their combined length is 7406 km. The places where the river sinuosity changed were compared to the structural lines of the "Atlas of the present-day geodynamics of the Pannonian Basin" (Horvath et al., 2006). 36 junctions along 26 structural lines were identified where the fault lines of this neotectonic map crossed the rivers. Across these points the mean sinuosity changed. Depending on the direction of the relative vertical movements, the sinuosity values increased or decreased. There were some points, where the sinuosity changed in an opposite way. Along these sections, the rivers belong to the range of unorganized meandering or there are lithological margins.
   Assuming that the rivers indicate on-going faulting accurately, some places were found, where positioning of the faults of the neotectonic map could be improved according to the sinuosity jumps. However, some significant sinuosity changes cannot be correlated to known faults. In these cases other factors may play a role (e.g., hydrological changes, increase of sediment discharge also can modify sinuosity). In order to clarify the origin of these changes seismic sections and other geodynamical information should be analyzed to prove or disprove tectonic relationship if hydrological reasons can be excluded.

AB  - The analysis of the main reasons for the unsatisfactory hydrogeological-reclamation state of the Danubian rice irrigation systems was carried out and the ways of its improvement due to the increase of drainage ability of irrigated lands of rice systems were considered. On the saline lands of the rice systems of the Danube delta drainage network is the main means of active and directed influence on the water-salt regime of the reclaimed area, formation of the regime of groundwater level, both in the growing season and in the not irrigated period for rice and attendant crops. Drainage network is essentially a determining factor in the formation of productivity of agricultural lands. An analysis of the efficiency of the drainage operation on the rice systems of the Danube Delta has shown that drainage built in accordance with the design standards that were in force at the time of construction does not provide uniform drainage ability in the area and the soil profile of rice fields. This is one of the main reasons for their unsatisfactory hydrogeological-reclamation state and reducing the yield of rice and attendant crops. By conducting optimization calculations according to the expense indicator, taking into account that optimal vertical filtration rate for the Danubian rice irrigation systems is at the level of 6...8 mm/day the optimal distance between the drains - 100 m was determined. Constructive improvement of existing rice systems with the drainage network in the form of open drains and distances between them - 250...500 m can be accomplished through the installation of additional separate closed drain-collectors. These drain-collectors are appropriate to arrange along the checks, with the set distance. For reducing the value of the vertical filtration rate in the drainage zone where it reaches 25 mm/day it is advisable to practice maintaining of water levels in the drainage network. Consequently, it is possible to achieve a reduction of the filtration rate to 4.5 mm/day. Developed measures and corresponding reconstruction of rice systems will enable to maintenance of satisfactory hydrological and hydrogeological regimes,ensure uniform salinity of soils during the cultivation of flooded rice, create favorable conditions for oxidation-reducing processes and maintenance of favorable ecological-reclamation state on the system.

AB  - Moving toward ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) necessitates a suite of ecological indicators that are responsive to fishing pressure, capable of tracking changes in the state of marine ecosystems, and related to management objectives. In this study, we employed the gradient forest method to assess the performance of 14 key ecological indicators in terms of specificity, sensitivity and the detection of thresholds for EBFM across ten marine ecosystems using four modelling frameworks (Ecopath with Ecosim, OSMOSE, Atlantis, and a multispecies size-spectrum model). Across seven of the ten ecosystems, high specificity to fishing pressure was found for most of the 14 indicators. The indicators biomass to fisheries catch ratio (B/C), mean lifespan and trophic level of fish community were found to have wide utility for evaluating fishing impacts. The biomass indicators, which have been identified as Essential Ocean Variables by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), had lower performance for evaluating fishing impacts, yet they were most sensitive to changes in primary productivity. The indicator B/C was most sensitive to low levels of fishing pressure with a generally consistent threshold response around 0.4*F-MSY (fishing mortality rate at maximum sustainable yield) across nine of the ten ecosystems. Over 50% of the 14 indicators had threshold responses at, or below similar to 0.6* F-MSY for most ecosystems, indicating that these ecosystems would have already crossed a threshold for most indicators when fished at F-MSY. This research provides useful insights on the performance of indicators, which contribute to facilitating the worldwide move toward EBFM.

AB  - Marine ecosystems have numerous benefits for human societies around the world and many policy initiatives now seek to maintain the health of these ecosystems. To enable wise decisions, up to date and accurate information on marine species and the state of the environment they live in is required. Moreover, this information needs to be openly accessible to build indicators and conduct timely assessments that decision makers can use. The questions and problems being addressed demand global-scale investigations, transdisciplinary science, and mechanisms to integrate and distribute data that otherwise would appear to be disparate. Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and marine Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), conceptualized by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), respectively, guide observation of the ocean. Additionally, significant progress has been made to coordinate efforts between existing programs, such as the GOOS, MBON, and Ocean Biogeographic Information System collaboration agreement. Globally and nationally relevant indicators and assessments require increased sharing of data and analytical methods, sustained long-term and large-scale observations, and resources to dedicated to these tasks. We propose a vision and key tenets as a guiding framework for building a global integrated system for understanding marine biological diversity and processes to address policy and resource management needs. This framework includes: using EOVs and EBVs and implementing the guiding principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data and action ecology. In doing so, we can encourage relevant, rapid, and integrative scientific advancement that can be implemented by decision makers to maintain marine ecosystem health.

AB  - Sensory hair cells are mechanoreceptors found in the inner ear that are required for hearing and balance. Hair cells are activated in response to sensory stimuli that mechanically deflect apical protrusions called hair bundles. Deflection opens mechanotransduction (MET) channels in hair bundles, leading to an influx of cations, including calcium. This cation influx depolarizes the cell and opens voltage-gated calcium channels located basally at the hair-cell presynapse. In mammals, hair cells are encased in bone, and it is challenging to functionally assess these activities in vivo. In contrast, larval zebrafish are transparent and possess an externally located lateral-line organ that contains hair cells. These hair cells are functionally and structurally similar to mammalian hair cells and can be functionally assessed in vivo. This article outlines a technique that utilizes a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI), GCaMP6s, to measure stimulus-evoked calcium signals in zebrafish lateral-line hair cells. GCaMP6s can be used, along with confocal imaging, to measure in vivo calcium signals at the apex and base of lateral-line hair cells. These signals provide a real-time, quantifiable readout of both mechanosensation- and presynapse-dependent calcium activities within these hair cells. These calcium signals also provide important functional information regarding how hair cells detect and transmit sensory stimuli. Overall, this technique generates useful data about relative changes in calcium activity in vivo. It is less well-suited for quantification of the absolute magnitude of calcium changes. This in vivo technique is sensitive to motion artifacts. A reasonable amount of practice and skill are required for proper positioning, immobilization, and stimulation of larvae. Ultimately, when properly executed, the protocol outlined in this article provides a powerful way to collect valuable information about the activity of hair-cells in their natural, fully integrated states within a live animal.

AB  - The size of the basin of attraction in ecosystems with alternative stable states is often referred to as "ecological resilience." Ecosystems with a low ecological resilience may easily be tipped into an alternative basin of attraction by a stochastic event. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure ecological resilience in practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small perturbations ( sometimes called "engineering resilience") is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience. Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as "critical slowing down." We demonstrate the robust occurrence of critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical slowing down could also indicate other critical transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory, the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming regime shifts in a system.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD), requires European Member States to assess the "ecological status" of surface waters. As part of this, many European countries have developed an ecological quality classification scheme for chlorophyll concentrations as a measure of phytoplankton abundance. The assessment of ecological quality must be based on the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate baseline, or 'reference condition'. It is, therefore, necessary to determine chlorophyll reference conditions for all European lake types. This involves examining how chlorophyll concentrations vary by lake type, in the absence of any nutrient pressures from agriculture or wastewater. For this purpose, a dataset of 540 European lakes considered to be in a relatively undisturbed reference condition has been assembled, including data on chlorophyll concentration, altitude, mean depth, alkalinity, humic content, surface area and geographical region. Chlorophyll was found to vary with lake type and geographical region, and to be naturally highest in low-altitude, very shallow, high alkalinity and humic lake types and naturally lowest in clear, deep, low alkalinity lakes. The results suggest that light and mineral availability are important drivers of chlorophyll concentrations in undisturbed lakes. Descriptive statistics (median and percentiles) of chlorophyll concentrations were calculated from populations of lakes in this reference lake dataset and used to derive lake-type specific reference chlorophyll concentrations. These reference conditions can be applied, through a comparison with observed chlorophyll concentrations at a site, in the assessments of ecological status and provide a consistent baseline to adopt for European countries.

In the paper we propose and discuss accessibility and other indicators-based urban transport system analysis and GIS (geographic information systems) calculation method for indicating problematic transportation zones in Vilnius city. The main parameter is time-based accessibility from/to the central part of Vilnius and other transport zones in the city. Created GIS application computes the ranks for transport zones of Vilnius city according to accessibility and Vilnius statistics in these zones (street network density in city zones, number of working places, number of equipped parking places, number of attractive objects in transportation zones). The GIS decision support system is based on 2 calculation methods TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and SAW (Simple Additive Weighting). Application of transportation zones analysis improves the quality of basic environment statistics and fills many data gaps related to urban statistics, providing information to decision-makers and the general public concerning key factors determining the state of urban transportation environment. This paper outlines criteria and models used in Vilnius to develop urban transportation indicators and the reasons why the selected indicators represent the first important step to achieve a comprehensive system of indicators of urban transportation sustainability in Vilnius city. This model could be integrated in systems of urban transport planning and sustainable development planning.

AB  - Applying ecosystem services (ES) concepts and indicators in landscape planning requires them to be linked with models for decision-making by practitioners. The objective of this paper is to introduce an ES-in-Planning framework, which combines ES assessment and valuation indicators with the widely used Driving Forces, Pressures, State, Impacts and Responses (DPSIR) model. Within this framework, ES indicators become part of landscape planning as a means of assessing the current state of the environment and for determining how it might change in the future. The implementation and added value of the framework is illustrated in a case study of planning issues in the Mardorf community bordering the Steinhuder Meer Lake, Northern Germany. Two scenarios of potential landscape changes and possible response measures are considered in terms of alterations in a set of ES indicators. The ES examined are food production (a provisioning ES), climate mitigation (a regulation ES), landscape esthetics (as the basis for many cultural ES), and biodiversity. The ES indicators employed distinguish between services valued by humans and those which are actually utilized. Valuation of changes in ES has shown to reflect societal objectives (as institutionalized in legal requirements) and expert-based estimates. However, these valuations could be further validated by including economic and social valuation of impacts. The added value of applying ES in the planning process lies in improved opportunities for developing targeted response measures, for communicating trade-offs between planning options, and for facilitating joint implementation by partners.

AB  - Global change poses significant challenges for ecosystem conservation. At regional scales, climate change may lead to extensive shifts in species distributions and widespread extirpations or extinctions. At landscape scales, land use and invasive species disrupt ecosystem function and reduce species richness. However, a lack of spatially explicit models of risk to ecosystems makes it difficult for science to inform conservation planning and land management. Here, I model risk to sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems in the state of Nevada, USA from climate change, land use/land cover change, and species invasion. Risk from climate change is based on an ensemble of 10 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) projections applied to two bioclimatic envelope models (Mahalanobis distance and Maxent). Risk from land use is based on the distribution of roads, agriculture, and powerlines, and on the spatial relationships between land use and probability of cheatgrass Bromus tectorum invasion in Nevada. Risk from land cover change is based on probability and extent of pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla; Juniperus spp.) woodland expansion. Climate change is most likely to negatively impact sagebrush ecosystems at the edges of its current range, particularly in southern Nevada, southern Utah, and eastern Washington. Risk from land use and woodland expansion is pervasive throughout Nevada, while cheatgrass invasion is most problematic in the northern part of the state. Cumulatively, these changes pose major challenges for conservation of sagebrush and sagebrush obligate species. This type of comprehensive assessment of ecosystem risk provides managers with spatially explicit tools important for conservation planning.

AB  - The number of variables involved in the monitoring of an ecosystem can be high and often one of the first stages in the analysis is to reduce the number of variables. We describe a method developed for geological purposes, using the information theory, that enables selection of the most relevant variables. This technique also allows the examination of the asymmetrical relationships between variables. Applied to a set of physical and biological variables (plankton assemblages in four areas of the North Sea), the method shows that biological variables are more informative than physical variables although the controlling factors are mainly physical (sea surface temperature in winter and spring). Among biological variables, diversity measures and warm-water species assemblages are informative for the state of the North Sea pelagic ecosystems while among physical variables sea surface temperature in late winter and early spring are highly informative. Although often used in bioclimatology, the utilisation of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index does not seem to provide a lot of information. The method reveals that only the extreme states of this index has an influence on North Sea pelagic ecosystems. The substantial and persistent changes that were detected in the dynamic regime of the North Sea ecosystems and called regime shift are detected by the method and corresponds to the timing of other shifts described in the literature for some European Systems such as the Baltic and the Mediterranean Sea when both physical and biological variables are considered.

AB  - This paper sought to understand the current state of the management environment of Lake Malawi Basin, deduce a lake vision and develop indicators for assessing Integrated Lake Basin Management (ILBM) in the lake basin. The premise of the study was that targeted indicators are necessary to effectively monitor the lake basin and manage it sustainably. The study focused on the Malawian side of the lake. Interviews, field observations and review of existing lake management and indicator development approaches around the world were the methods employed. It was found that Malawi lacks focus on lakes in its strategies and the existing management of the lake is on a sector-to-sector basis with little coordination. Furthermore, the capacity of lake-related sector institutions is hampered by inadequate resources and unstable flow of funds. It was concluded that the current management of the lake basin is unsustainable and there is need to comprehensively monitor the lake basin as well as formulate and implement management plans and strategies that are based on the knowledge obtained from targeted monitoring. A set of governance indicators was developed taking into account the characteristics of the lake, the values that it offers and the threats that it is facing.

AB  - Within the current context of biodiversity loss a number of biodiversity indicators have been developed to help measure the state of nature and how it is changing. However, most indicators are derived from bird populations. Reptiles and amphibians could be useful ecosystem indicators, but this requires obtaining precise and unbiased population parameters. This is a particularly challenging task for these two groups of species, because individuals are extremely difficult to detect for various reasons. We illustrate the use of a sampling and analytical method that explicitly takes into account imperfect detection to assess the population dynamics of a reptile species and its temporal and spatial variation. European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) were sampled at two different locations during a 10-year study. The two sites differed by their water management regimes and number of livestock. At each site and for each sex, the data were modeled using a robust design capture-mark-recapture framework to obtain and compare estimates of survival, temporary emigration, time-specific abundance, density, and population growth rate, while taking into account effects of individual heterogeneity, trap-response, and time on capture probabilities. Temporary emigration was higher in males (0.344 +/- 0.046) (mean +/- SE) than in females (0.228 +/- 0.071), did not differ between sites for each sex, and was mainly Markovian. Apparent adult survival was higher in females (0.966 +/- 0.031) than in males (0.864 +/- 0.024), and was negatively related to the proportion of individuals with repaired shell fractures in the population. Average density was 63.7 +/- 6.6 turtles/km(2) but was higher for females (39.2 +/- 14.0 females/km(2)) than for males (23.5 +/- 5.7 males/km(2)). The population sizes of males and females decreased where long periods of artificial drought and the highest density of livestock occurred. This research highlights differences in demographic parameters according to sex and site in a turtle species, and it provides evidence that significant human-induced disturbance represents a potential risk to European pond turtle populations. The sampling and analytical approaches illustrated in this study are applicable to many other species of reptiles and amphibians, and estimated population parameters could be combined to produce population indicators useful for conservation and management.

AB  - Biomass harvesting and associated management practices increase the availability of forest-based feedstocks for emerging bioproduct and energy markets. Concerns about the sustainability of these practices have led to the development of biomass harvesting guidelines (BHGs) by state, national, and international agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Site productivity BHG provisions include retaining specific proportions of harvested residues and restricting biomass harvesting on some sites. Field experiments have shown that forest responses to biomass harvesting vary widely and are often counterintuitive. With site-specific data lacking, BHGs tend to rely on default assumptions supported by best professional judgment. These include (i) the natural or unmanaged state is an ideal frame of reference, (ii) conventional harvesting retains and distributes most residues across the site, (iii) biomass harvesting removes virtually all residues, (iv) decomposing residues always enhance soil C and site productivity, (v) biomass harvesting is conducted in the absence of operational practices that alleviate site deficiencies and sustain productivity, and (vi) changes in forest state are equivalent to changes in forest function. Effective BHGs are science based, operationally feasible, and protect values of interest while allowing managers the flexibility to prevent or mitigate potential impacts within constraints imposed by best management practices and forest certification provisions. While harvesting-induced nutrient deficiencies can be prevented or corrected with fertilizers or other soil amendments, soil disturbance and exposure may warrant greater attention. Policy-relevant field studies should incorporate operational practices, examine linkages between indicators and values of interest, and evaluate and improve prevention and mitigation options.

AB  - Michigan stream fish and macroinvertebrate community data from multiple sources were combined to conduct a statewide assessment of riverine ecological condition. Using regionally normalized metrics to correct for methodological inconsistencies and natural variation and statistically based scoring criteria, about 50% of all sampled sites were in expected or better ecological condition, 30% were ecologically impaired, and 20% were marginal. Structural Equation Modeling with this regional assessment dataset indicated that land use effects were more important than effects of point-source discharges. Biological metrics appeared to be more sensitive to urban than agricultural land use, and riparian than basin-wide agricultural land use. Invertebrate communities were marginally more sensitive than fish communities to the suite of anthropogenic stressors examined. Using the observed assessment status from sampled sites, Classification and Regression Tree models were used to estimate ecological condition in the state's remaining unsampled river segments. Combining observed and estimated site scores, 25% of the state's river kms were estimated to be impaired, with the Erie and St. Clair basins having the highest degree of impairment (52% and 44% of total channel lengths, respectively) and lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron basins had the lowest degree of impairment at 4%, 21% and 31%, respectively. We argue that correlations between the state of the Great Lakes and the ecological conditions of their tributary systems reflect both direct impact transmission from watershed to receiving waters, and also non-causal correlation due to shared anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - The relevance. Functioning of mining operations in modern conditions is characterized by the active influence of external and internal factors. In the conditions of unstable external environment, upon transition from one development stage to another, subsystems of mining operations have to submit to the purpose of ensuring steady functioning of the enterprise - providing output streams with the set parameters. During this period stability of mining and technical systems changes that have an impact on a condition of economic and social subsystems of mining operations, and also on the state of environment caused by changes in parameters of technology and engineering procedures. It demands the development of the new approaches and the management principles of work of the mining operations based on coordination of economic targets with the purposes in the field of ecology and social development.
   The main aim of the research is to form sustainable development concept of mining and technical systems in transitional periods of open pit mining based on systematization of the existing principles of sustainable development in the mining industry.
   Objects: mining operations, mining and technical systems, opening-up system of opencast.
   Methods: literature review, structural and functional analysis, system analysis.
   Results. The paper substantiates the key role of the opening-up system of opencast in the structure of the mining and technical systems for achieving sustainable development goals of the mining operations. The systematization of the sustainable functioning and development principles of the mining operations and their systems were carried out, four groups of principles were highlighted: system-wide principles of management, development principles of the mining operations, development principles of mining and technical systems, development principles of the subsystems of mining and technical systems. The idea of consecutive transformation of the subsystems of mining and technical systems at all design stages and operation considering economic, social and ecological aspects for ensuring the established parameters of functioning of the mining operations is the basis for the offered system of the principles. The authors proposed the concept of sustainable development of mining and technical systems in transitional periods of open pit mining. The use of the proposed approach during transition from open pit mining to the open-underground mining allows us to improve the economic, environmental and social indicators of the functioning of the mining operations systems.

AB  - The natural capital (NC) of India and its management system are essential conditions of the welfare path to the sustainable development of the country. We conduct an accounting process for India's NC to measure sustainability to ensure that future generations will have the equal total wealth per capita accessible to them as that available to the present generation. We then describe the combination of the renewable and non-renewable NC that is relevant within the concepts of welfare and sustainability. First, we note that India has successful forestation, which has enhanced welfare for its residents. However, the other renewables (e.g., cropland, fishery) and non-renewables (e.g., fossil fuels, minerals) are continuously degraded as a result of economic development and population growth. Second, we discuss the correlation between sustainable resource management and pro-environmental behavior (PEB) and explain the importance of considering these factors to achieve green growth. Third, to provide practitioners with useful information on how to promote PEB and to discover the determinants of PEB, we analyze the survey data of 5,200 respondents from all Indian states. We identify that environmental knowledge is an important determinant of individuals' PEB in India. In the policy analysis, we evaluate the challenges to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) using NC accounting in India. We recommend several policy implications to maintain NC at a sustainable level and to achieve SDGs.

AB  - Paleolimnological techniques can reveal long-term perturbations and associated stable state transitions of lake ecosystems. However, such transitions are difficult to predict since changes to lake ecosystems can be abrupt or gradual. This study examined whether there were past transitions in the ecological regime of Kings Billabong, a shallow River Murray wetland in southeast Australia. A 94-cm-long core, covering c. 90 years of age, was analysed at 1 cm resolution for subfossil cladocerans, diatoms and other proxies. Prior to river regulation (c. 1930), the littoral to planktonic ratios of cladocerans and diatoms, and bulk sediment delta C-13 values were high, while the period from c. 1930 to c. 1970 experienced considerable changes to the wetland ecosystem. The abrupt nature of changes of planktonic cladocerans and diatoms, particularly after the onset of river regulation (1930s), was triggered by inundation, high rates of sedimentation and shifts in bulk sediment delta N-15 values. However, the transition of a once littoral-dominated community, to one favouring an increasingly turbid, plankton-dominated trophic condition following river regulation was relatively slow and lasted for decades. The progression to a new regime was likely delayed by the partial recovery of submerged plant communities and related internal dynamics.

AB  - The environment project in the greater Mekong sub-region was the largest multi -field environmental coopera-tion launched by six countries (China, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia) in 2006, since the cooperation mechanism was established by Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1992. How to establish the in-dicators to assess the achievements of the biological corridor construction and the status of ecological en-vironment quantitatively is one of the prerequisites for the future project ongoing phase. The popular Pressure -State-Response (PSR) framework was employed in this study to assess the natural and human pressure, the healthy state of regional natural environment, and the subsequent response of ecosystem dynamic change in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Instead of using surveying based data as driving parameters, large amount of driving factors were retrieved from multi-source remote sensing data from 2000 to 2017, which provides access to larger updated and real-time databases, more tangible data allowing more objective goal management, and better spatially covered. The driving factors for pressure analysis included digital elevation, land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, light index, road network map, land cover dynamic change and land use degree, which were derived directly and indirectly from remote sensing. The indicators for state evaluation were composed of ve-getation index, leaf area index, and fractional vegetation cover from remote sensing directly. The comprehensive response index was mainly determined by the pressure and state indicators. Through the analysis based on an overlay technique, it showed that the ecological environment deteriorated firstly from 2000 to 2010 and then started to improve from 2010 to 2017. The proofs indicated that the natural forest and wetland ecosystems were improved and the farmland area was decreased between 2000 and 2017. This study explored effective indicators from remote sensing for the ecological and environmental assessment, which can provide a strong decision -making basis for promoting the sustainable development of the ecological environment in the greater Mekong subregion, as well as the technological support for the construction of the biodiversity corridor.

AB  - Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for metals are widely applied in ecological risk assessments and in the development of regulatory water quality guidelines in Europe, and in 2007 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended BLM-based water quality criteria (WQC) for Cu in freshwater. However, to-date, few states have adopted BLM-based Cu criteria into their water quality standards on a state-wide basis, which appears to be due to the perception that the BLM is too complicated or requires too many input variables. Using the mechanistic BLM framework to first identify key water chemistry parameters that influence Cu bioavailability, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, and hardness, we developed Cu criteria using the same basic methodology used by the USEPA to derive hardness-based criteria but with the addition of DOC and pH. As an initial proof of concept, we developed stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) models for species that have been tested over wide ranges of DOC, pH, and hardness conditions. These models predicted acute Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 77% to 97% of tests (5 species had adequate data) and chronic Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 92% of tests (1 species had adequate data). This level of accuracy is comparable to the BLM. Following USEPA guidelines for WQC development, the species data were then combined to develop a linear model with pooled slopes for each independent parameter (i.e., DOC, pH, and hardness) and species-specific intercepts using Analysis of Covariance. The pooled MLR and BLM models predicted species-specific toxicity with similar precision; adjusted R2 and R2 values ranged from 0.56 to 0.86 and 0.66-0.85, respectively. Graphical exploration of relationships between predicted and observed toxicity, residuals and observed toxicity, and residuals and concentrations of key input parameters revealed many similarities and a few key distinctions between the performances of the two models. The pooled MLR model was then applied to the species sensitivity distribution to derive acute and chronic criteria equations similar in form to the USEPAs current hardness-based criteria equations but with DOC, pH, and hardness as the independent variables. Overall, the MLR is less responsive to DOC than the BLM across a range of hardness and pH conditions but more responsive to hardness than the BLM. Additionally, at low and intermediate hardness, the MLR model is less responsive than the BLM to pH, but the two models respond comparably at high hardness. The net effect of these different response profiles is that under many typical water quality conditions, MLR- and BLM-based criteria are quite comparable. Indeed, conditions where the two models differ most (high pH/low hardness and low pH/high hardness) are relatively rare in natural aquatic systems. We suggest that this MLR-based approach, which includes the mechanistic foundation of the BLM but is also consistent with widely accepted hardness-dependent WQC in terms of development and form, may facilitate adoption of updated state-wide Cu criteria that more accurately account for the parameters influencing Cu bioavailability than current hardness-based criteria.

AB  - Amphibians are considered to be excellent bioindicators to their morphophysiological characteristics and life cycle. In this context, the present study investigated the morphological integrity of anuran larvae collected in preserved environments in the Emas National Park, in the municipality of Mineiros (Goias state, Brazil), and in environments representative of the agricultural matrix of the Rio Verde region, also in Goias, where there is a long history of the use of agricultural pesticides. Samples of water from temporary ponds, permanent dams, and veredas were analyzed for the presence of pesticides and, especially atrazine (5350g/L), found at significantly higher concentrations in the agricultural matrix. We observed a high percentage (approximately 10%) of morphological malformations including alterations of the fins in Boana albopunctatus and Scinax fuscovarius; alteration in oral structures in B. albopunctatus, Dematonotus muelleri, Physalaemus centralis, Physalaemus cuvieri, and Leptodactylus fuscus mainly in the tadpoles collected in the agricultural environment in comparison with those from the protected area (3.5%; P<0.0001, (2) 31.75). However, changes in the eyes, mouth, intestines, and nostrils, as well as amelia were observed only in the agricultural environment. The vast majority of the observed malformations were associated with the tail and oral disc, which suggests that these anatomical parameters may be used as sensitive morphological biomarkers. Given these findings, we reinforce that areas of agricultural land may have a deleterious effect on the morphological integrity of the tadpoles and consequently, on their development, and that these features may be used as indicators of environmental quality and health.

AB  - Invasive species have the potential to create positive feedbacks and push an ecosystem into an alternative state through a variety of mechanisms. Unless the drivers behind these feedbacks are understood, restoring a system to a more desirable state may not be possible. We used a long-term vernal pool restoration project based out of Travis Airforce Base, Fairfield, CA, U.S.A. to examine natural pools dominated by either invasive or native plant communities, and restored pools predominately composed of invasive plants. We determined that plant community structure is drastically altered towards invasive grasses with the addition of a single centimeter of litter. In the absence of this litter layer, community structure was driven by a non-native forb rather than native species. We also found that native plant-dominated vernal pools have a longer inundation duration and are deeper compared to invasive-dominated pools, regardless of construction status. These results suggest that once invasive grasses establish through lower inundation depths, their litter deposition can initiate a positive feedback to maintain an invasive alternative state. However, even after litter removal, non-native forbs can replace the grasses causing a second alternative state still separate from the most desirable native dominated state. This study directly demonstrates that invasive species, and their positive feedbacks, may limit the success of ecological restoration. To effectively restore a system all constraints must be identified and removed before successful restoration can occur.

AB  - Low energy electron beam (LEEB) treatment is an emerging non-thermal technology that performs surface decontamination with a minimal influence on food quality. Bacterial spore resistance toward LEEB treatment and its influencing factors were investigated in this study. Spores from Geobacillus and Bacillus species were treated with a labscale LEEB at energy levels of 80 and 200 keV. The spore resistances were expressed as D-values (the radiation dose required for one log(10) reduction at a given energy level) calculated from the linear regression of log(10) reduction against absorbed dose of the sample. The results revealed that the spore inactivation efficiency by LEEB is comparable to that of other ionizing radiations and that the inactivation curves are mostly log(10) -linear at the investigated dose range (3.8 - 8.2 kGy at 80 keV; 6.0 - 9.8 kGy at 200 keV). The D-values obtained from the wildtype strains varied from 2.2 - 3.0 kGy at 80 keV, and from 2.2 - 3.1 kGy at 200 keV. Bacillus subtilis mutant spores lacking alpha/beta-type small, acid-soluble spore proteins showed decreased D-values (1.3 kGy at 80 and 200 keV), indicating that spore DNA is one of the targets for LEEB spore inactivation. The results revealed that bacterial species, sporulation conditions and the treatment dose influence the spore LEEB inactivation. This finding indicates that for the application of this emerging technology, special attention should be paid to the choice of biological indicator, physiological state of the indicator and the processing settings. High spore inactivation efficiency supports the application of LEEB for the purpose of food surface decontamination. With its environmental, logistical, and economic advantages, LEEB can be a relevant technology for surface decontamination to deliver safe, minimally processed and additive-free food products.

AB  - Nonnative plants are widely recognized as stressors to wetlands and other ecosystems. They may compete with native plant species or communities and alter ecosystem properties, which can affect ecological condition, posing challenges to resource managers. As part of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA), we characterized the status of nonnative plants in wetlands across the conterminous United States (US). Our primary goals were to (1) document the composition of nonnative taxa at 1138 NWCA sites sampled in 2011 and (2) estimate the areal extent of wetland under stress from nonnative plants within the NWCA 2011 sampled population of similar to 25 million ha of wetland (represented by 967 sampled probability sites and the NWCA survey design). A total of 443 unique nonnative taxa were observed, encompassing a species pool adapted to diverse ecological conditions. For individual sites, the number of nonnative taxa ranged from 0 to 29, and total absolute cover of nonnatives ranged from 0 to 160%. We devised the nonnative plant indicator (NNPI) as a categorical indicator of stress (low to very high) from the collective set of nonnative plant taxa occurring at a particular location, based on a decision matrix of exceedance values for nonnative richness, relative frequency, and relative cover. Wetland area of the sampled population occurring in each NNPI category was estimated at the scale of the conterminous US and within five large ecoregions and four broad wetland types. Potential stress from nonnative plants, as indicated by the NNPI category, was low for approximately 61% (similar to 15.3 million ha), moderate for about 20% (similar to 5.2 million ha), high for about 10% (similar to 2.48 million ha), and very high for about 9% (similar to similar to 2.2 million ha) of the wetland area in the entire sampled population. Percent of wetland area with high and very high NNPI varied by ecoregional subpopulations: greater within interior and western ecoregions (similar to 29 to 87%) than within ecoregions in the eastern half of the nation (similar to 11%). Among wetland type subpopulations, greater percent of wetland area with high and very high NNPI was observed for herbaceous vs. woody types and for inland vs. estuarine types. Estimates of wetland area by NNPI categories are expected to be useful to policy makers or resource managers for prioritizing management actions by identifying situations where stress from nonnative plants is most extensive. We also considered four exploratory analyses aimed at providing ecological information useful in interpreting NNPI extent results. We conducted three population-scale analyses examining ecoregional and wetland type population means for (1) the three NNPI metrics, (2) absolute cover of growth-habit groups of nonnative plants, and (3) metrics describing human-mediated disturbance. Finally, we examined ecological relationships with site-level NNPI status using a random forest (RF) analysis with NNPI as the response variable and predictor variables including ecoregion, wetland type, and a variety of characteristics describing natural vegetation structure, environment, and human-mediated disturbance.

AB  - Measures of near-shore physical habitat structure have only recently been employed in large-scale assessments of lake ecological condition. We outline and evaluate a rapid approach for quantifying lake physical habitat structure and disturbance that was piloted in the Northeast United States by the US Environmental Protection Agency in its Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP-NE), then improved and applied in the 2007 National Lakes Assessment (NLA). This approach measures littoral habitat complexity, fish cover, substrate, aquatic macrophytes, riparian vegetation, and human disturbances. Of 46 NLA physical habitat metrics, 34 had repeat-visit standard deviations <10% of their potential ranges, indicating repeatability sufficient to distinguish 4 to 5 levels of habitat condition within that range. For 23 metrics, the signal to noise ratio (S/N) of among-lake to same-year repeat-visit variance was moderate to high (3-10), indicating that noise variance was a relatively small confounding factor in their interpretation. Most NLA metrics were 30-40% more precise than those of EMAP-NE, largely because NLA used a greater number of habitat percent cover classes. We conclude that the metrics and indices derived from the NLA physical habitat field approach are precise enough to quantify near-shore habitat structure for contributing to national, state, and ecoregional assessments of lake condition.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Air pollution has been of a major problem in the Pearl River Delta of south China, particularly during the last two decades. Emissions of air pollutants from industries have already led to damages in natural communities and environments in a wide range of the Delta area. Leaf parameters such as chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf area (LA), dry weight (DW) and leaf mass per area (LMA) had once been used as specific indexes of environmental stress. This study aims to determine in situ if the daily variation of chlorophyll fluorescence and other ecophysiological parameters in five seedlings of three woody species, Ilex rotunda, Ficus microcarpa and Machilus chinensis, could be used alone or in combination with other measurements for sensitivity indexes to make diagnoses under air pollution stress and, hence, to choose the correct tree species for urban afforestation in the Delta area.
   Methods. Five seedlings of each species were transplanted in pot containers after their acclimation under shadowing conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made in situ by a portable fluorometer (OS-30, Opti-sciences, U.S.A). Ten random samples of leaves were picked from each species for LA measurements by area-meter (CI-203, CID, Inc., U.S.A). DW was determined after the leaf samples were dried to a constant weight at 65degreesC. LMA was calculated as the ratio of DW/LA. Leaf N content,was analyzed according to the Kjeldhal method, and the extraction of pigments was carried out according Lin et al.
   Results and Discussion. The daily mean F-v/F-m (F-v is the variable fluorescence and F-m is the maximum fluorescence) analysis showed that Ilex rotunda and Ficus microcarpa were more highly resistant to pollution stress, followed by Machilus chinensis, implying that the efficiency of photosystem II in I. rotunda was less affected by air pollutants than the other two species. Little difference in daily change of F-v/F-m in I. rotunda between the polluted and the clean site was also observed. However, a relatively large variation of F-v/F-m appeared in the other two species, particularly in M. chinensis, suggesting that they were more sensitive to air pollutants than I. rotunda.
   The mean LA was reduced for all species growing at the polluted site. The mean LMA for all species exceeded the sclerophylly threshold given by Cowling and Campbell and increased for those under pollution stress, which could be explained as one of the acclimation strategies for plants to air pollution stress.
   Little difference in leaf chlorophyll content was observed in F. microcarpa and M. chinensis, while remarkable differences were found in I. rotunda growing at the polluted and the clean site. Content of leaf carotenoids was largely reduced in I. rotunda growing at the polluted site, but increased in E microcarpa and M. chinensis, compared with plants growing at the clean site. Plants growing at the clean site had a lower leaf N content than those growing at the polluted site. In addition, species with a higher resistance to pollution stress showed less difference in leaf N content than those sensitive species.
   Conclusion. Based on F-v/F-m. measurements of the three woody species, I. rotunda showed the highest resistance to air pollutants from ceramic industries, followed by E microcarpa. M. chinensis was the most sensitive species to air pollution, had lowest capacities to cope with the air pollution stress, which was consistent with visual injury symptoms observed in the crown profiles of plants at the polluted site. F-v/F-m, LAM, LA, leaf pigments and N content could be used alone or in combination to diagnose the extent of the physiological injury. The ratio of F-v/F-m, however, was the best and most effective parameter.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Tree species which have higher air-pollutant resistance, as diagnosed by such ecophysiological parameters, should be considered first and planted widely for urban afforestation or forest regeneration in areas where the forest was seriously degraded or forest health was markedly effected by the same kind of air pollutants.

AB  - Dung beetles are insects involved in the organic matter cycle, providing services in ecosystem functions through their feeding and reproductive behavior. Environmental degradation of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil causes a decrease in species richness, which may affect ecosystem processes. However, many of the characteristics related to the ecological functions of dung beetle species remains unknown. Our study aimed to describe the ecological characteristics of dung beetle species that inhabit the natural forest environments of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil. We used databases from research conducted from 2007 through 2014 coupled with standardized sampling methods to capture copro-necrophagous Scarabaeinae in 103 native Atlantic forest areas in 20 locations in the state of Santa Catarina. The 98 species collected, representing six tribes and 20 genera, were identified, photographed to scale and categorized according to their feeding habit, resource allocation behavior, did activity, relative abundance, body size, and distribution range in the state. Most of the species were of small size (n = 54) and tunnelers (n = 47), and almost half of the species (n = 42) were found only in one site, while 85 species were considered rare in relative abundance. In addition to contributing to the knowledge of dung beetle ecology in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, this study shows the species distribution in the region and highlights the importance of remaining forest fragments in the maintenance of biodiversity and the ecosystem functions carried out by these beetles.

AB  - Thyroid hormones (TH), thyroxine (T-4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3), play crucial roles in regulation of growth, development and metabolism in vertebrates and are targets for endocrine disruptive agents. Perturbations in TH action can contribute to the development of disease states and the US Environmental Protection Agency is developing a high throughput screen using TH-dependent metamorphosis of the Xenopus laevis tadpole as an assay platform. Currently this methodology relies on external morphological endpoints and changes in central thyroid axis parameters. However, exposure-related changes in gene expression in TH-sensitive tissue types that occur over shorter time frames have the potential to augment this screen. Using a combination of cDNA array and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) analyses, this study identifies molecular markers in tissues peripheral to the central thyroid axis. We examine the hindlimb and tail of tadpoles up to 96 h of continuous exposure to T-3, T-4, methimazole, propylthiouracil, or perchlorate. Several novel biomarker candidates are indicated that include transcripts encoding importin, RNA helicase II/Gu, and defender against death protein, DAD1. In combination with previously-identified biomarker candidates, these transcripts will greatly augment the predictive and diagnostic power of the Xenopus metamorphosis assay for perturbation of TH action.

AB  - Biodiversity can, on the one hand be seen as a basis for ecosystem services and consequently for the associated human welfare; on the other, biodiversity as such has an independent value for man. However, biodiversity means not only the diversity of species, but also encompasses a number of manifestations of land use and the occurrence of genes, which also contribute to biodiversity, and which require assessment by suitable indicators.
   The present study seeks to describe biodiversity not only at the species level, but also the level of landscape variety, and to ascertain the connections between them. Its purpose is to develop a set of indicators for a comprehensive representation of biodiversity which contains species and habitat characteristics and can be used for planning practice and for scenarios.
   The study area is the district of Gorlitz in the German state of Saxony, which borders Poland and the Czech Republic. Details regarding the population size of Red List bird species for the time period 2003-2007 were analyzed, using data from the MultibaseCS database of the Saxon state Conservation of Nature Authority. Land use and specific land elements derived from the 2005 biotope mapping process were described by state indicators. In addition, regional statistical data on traffic volume and paved areas were used as impact indicators. All indicators were compiled and compared based on a 1000 m grid, so as to ascertain statistical correlations.
   The highest correlations between a combined species metric ("species-sum index") and landscape structure indicators were ascertained for birds of water and wetland habitats. However, those indicators revealed only slight correlations for birds in the other two landscape types, forests and open country. The best connections for all three habitat types between species and structural data were found using edge density indicators. All significant correlations were helpful for the evaluation of future landscape scenarios and, therefore provide a good basis for the design and implementation of planning goals.

AB  - Water is transferred from the atmosphere to the land surface mainly via various forms of atmospheric precipitation, but the contribution of surface condensation and direct deposition (e. g., dew, hoar frost, occult precipitation, etc.) should not be neglected. Wet deposition (including surface condensation and direct deposition) scavenges pollutants from the atmosphere and contributes significantly to their transport. The composition of the runoff formed on contact with various surfaces might be further modified by the components of dry deposition collected on these surfaces or by substances leaching from the surfaces themselves. Samples of wet precipitation or direct deposition might be good indicators of the state of the atmospheric environment and can be used to trace the migration of chemicals emitted from various sources, including anthropogenic ones. This paper discusses the unique challenges present at every stage of the analytical procedures used for the determination of the pollutants in atmospheric precipitation and deposition. A brief review of the results of pollutant and toxicity determination in samples of various forms of atmospheric precipitation and (or) deposition is also included, together with a discussion of the application of chemometric techniques for data interpretation. The aim of this paper is to help interested readers discover the field of pollutant determination in wet deposition and to broaden the scope of their existing research.

AB  - Human use of land areas leads to impacts on nature in several ways. Within the framework of the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, it was stated that life cycle assessment (LCA) of land use should assess at least the impact on biodiversity, the impact on biotic production, and the impact on the regulating functions of the natural environment. This study focuses on the climatic impact of land use as determined by the CO(2) transfers between vegetation/soil and the atmosphere in the course of terrestrial release and re-storage of carbon.
   Compared with the potential natural vegetation as a baseline, areas getting transformed by man (land transformations) as well as areas forced to maintain their current non-natural state (land occupations) may store reduced amounts of carbon in soil and vegetation, whereby the mobilized carbon is essentially transferred to the atmosphere in form of CO(2), contributing to global warming. The size of this climatic impact is determined by the amount of carbon transferred per hectare, as well as by the duration of the carbon's stay in air. Generally, we consider this duration as limited by spontaneous reversal of vegetation and soil toward a quasi-natural form as soon as human land use ends. Taking the mean stay in air of 1 ton carbon from fossil fuel combustion as a basis of comparison, 1 ton carbon released by, e.g., a forest-to-cropland transformation can be adequately weighted by considering the timing of carbon backflow from air to the spontaneously regrowing forest.
   Carbon transfers to the air per hectare, as well as imputable durations of carbon stay in air, are determined for the most important types of land transformation and land occupation, for locations in any of the terrestrial biomes of tropical forest, temperate forest, boreal forest, tropical grassland, and temperate grassland. The carbon quantities are expressed as "fossil-combustion-equivalent" tons of carbon so that they can be summed up with carbon amounts from fossil fuel combustion into the usual LCA indicator for global warming potential.
   The results confirm that on a per hectare basis, transforming forests into cropland has a more serious climatic effect than continuing to occupy such land as cropland for one additional year. But on a global basis, maintaining current cropland areas for one additional year is a serious driver of global warming due to the huge area of croplands in zones where forest would be the natural vegetation. Furthermore, forest-to-cropland transformations cause carbon transfers to air per hectare of roughly similar size in tropical, temperate, or boreal zones, but due to slow forest restoration, transformation of boreal forests has a stronger influence on global warming.
   The results of this study facilitate a worldwide impact assessment of land use with respect to global warming. Together with the two separate studies covering the impacts of land use on biodiversity and on biotic production, a tool will be available for a reasonably complete LCA of land use at global level. However, the data quality needs further improvement.

AB  - State-of-the-art environmental assessment of waste management systems rely on data for the physicochemical composition of individual material fractions comprising the waste in question. To derive the necessary inventory data for different scopes and systems, literature data from different sources and backgrounds are consulted and combined. This study provides an overview of physico-chemical waste characterisation data for individual waste material fractions available in literature and thereby aims to support the selection of data fitting to a specific scope and the selection of uncertainty ranges related to the data selection from literature. Overall, 97 publications were reviewed with respect to employed characterisation method, regional origin of the waste, number of investigated parameters and material fractions and other qualitative aspects. Descriptive statistical analysis of the reported physico-chemical waste composition data was performed to derive value ranges and data distributions for element concentrations (e.g. Cd content) and physical parameters (e.g. heating value). Based on 11,886 individual data entries, median values and percentiles for 47 parameters in 11 individual waste fractions are presented. Exceptional values and publications are identified and discussed. Detailed datasets are attached to this study, allowing further analysis and new applications of the data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to postglacial isostatic uplift many stratified lakes, at different stages of isolation, are located along the shores of the White Sea. In five lakes, located near the White Sea Biological Station of Moscow State University, salinity, temperature, pH, concentration of dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and illuminance were measured. Distribution of microorganisms and spectral properties of water layers were also studied. All the lakes had a narrow bright coloured layer in the redox zone caused by mass development of phototropic microorganisms. Light absorption and fluorescence spectra indicated algae containing chlorophyll a predominate in the red water layers while the colouration of green and brown layers is caused by green sulphur bacteria with bacteriochlorophylls d and e. Sunlight is completely absorbed in the redox zone because of the high density of algae and/or bacteria, resulting in aphotic conditions below. Coloured layers act as a specific biotope for special communities of microorganisms. Eukaryotes identified by the 18S rRNA gene included different species of mixotrophic algae and ciliates resistant to anoxia. The water layer colour and spectral characteristics (i.e. light absorption and fluorescence) of water in the redox zone can be considered indicators of the stage of lake isolation from the sea, with the red colour caused by cryptophyte alga Rhodomonas sp. bloom found in earlier stages and brown and green colours caused by green sulphur bacteria in later stages.

AB  - Urbanization processes affect the ecosystem through alterations in ecological functions and landscape patterns. Currently, analysis of the total ecosystem services value (ESV) has targeted the overall benefits which human beings obtain from the regional ecosystem but does not generally include information regarding ecological structures and patterns. Therefore, the results cannot reflect the comprehensive state of the local ecosystem. We propose a new, integrative ecosystem quality indicator based on the ESVand landscape metrics for evaluating the quality of the regional ecosystem. We adopted the method of a coupled degree of coordination for evaluating the interrelationship between urbanization and ecosystem quality in Lianyungang City from 1985 to 2010. The coupling degree of coordination between urbanization and ecosystem quality showed an inverse U-shaped curve. At the primary stage of urbanization (1985aEuro'1995), the degree of coupling of urbanization and the ecosystem was just barely balanced. From 1995 until 2000, the coupling system reached a balanced condition, in which the urbanization level increased. Since 2000, the urbanization process has accelerated. The coordination between urbanization and the ecosystem achieved the optimum condition in 2005. A turning point appeared at the same time, and the degree of coupling coordination began falling from the optimum. Subsequently, the coupled system once more entered a barely balanced state. Overall, the comprehensive level of ecosystem quality decreased since 1985 and degraded sharply after 2005, suggesting an overall degradation of the local ecosystem quality.

AB  - Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) can devastate property and possessions by generating heavy rainfall and severe weather during summer over central-eastern China. If the critical parameters in determining whether concentrated convection would undergo upscale growth into an MCS are found, then the damages produced by severe weather can be prevented and reduced in central-eastern China. The NCEP data were used to compare the environments prior to MCS development with the environments of widespread convections (WCS) that did not undergo upscale growth and organization into MCS across central-eastern China (110 degrees E-124 degrees E, 27 degrees N-40 degrees N) during summer (June August) of 2008-2010.
   This analysis is based on the recognition result of 208 MCSs and 174 WCS. One method used in this analysis involved taking a single value of a given field for each case at a specific point. For MCSs the NCEP analysis data (time resolution every 6 h, spatial resolution 1 degrees X 1 degrees) were extracted at 6 h prior to development from the location of centroid of the MCS at initiation, which were taken at the time of the maximum number of convective cells from the approximate center of the group of thunderstorms for WCS. A statistical analysis of mean and standard deviations of the data was made once all of the point-value data were compared for the different conditions. A 14 degrees X 10 degrees movable grid centered on each case for the precursor environments of MCS and WCS was used to create composites of numerous parameters. An objective method of evaluation (POD, FAR, HSS, TS and BS) including making a dichotomous forecast was also implemented to test the skill and accuracy of the various parameters in forecasting MCSs.
   The precursor environments of hundreds of MCSs and instances of WCS were examined to gain insights into environmental conditions that support a concentrated group of thunderstorms into an MCS. Significant differences were found during these physical quantities between MCSs and WCS: (1) A statistical analysis of point-value data was performed to compare the precursor environments of MCSs and WCS through analyzing some basic physical and commonly derived quantities by using the methods of statistics of mean and standard deviations. The different quantities were obtained to identify MCSs and WCS: 2 m specific humidity, vapor flux divergence at 1000 and 850 hPa, relative humidity, specific humidity, temperature-dewpoint spread and temperature advection of 850 and 700 hPa, index of conditional convective stability (ILC), Showalter index (SI), lifted index on surface (LFTXS), convective available potential energy on surface (CAPES), total index (TTI), severe weather threat index(SWEAT), modified K index (MK), 0 similar to 1 km vertical wind shear and 0 similar to 3 km vertical wind shear. (2) Obvious characterization were found between MCSs and WCS by using storm-relative composites: 2 m specific humidity, relative humidity and temperature-dewpoint spread of 850, temperature advection of 850 and 700 hPa, SI, LFTXS, CAPES, TTI, SWEAT, MK, 0 similar to 1 km vertical wind shear and 0 similar to 3 km vertical wind shear. (3) Based on the previous results, five most important parameters in determining whether concentrated convective would undergo upscale growth into an MCS are obtained by using evaluation methods: LFTXS, SWEAT, MK, 2 m specific humidity and 0 similar to 3 km vertical wind shear.
   Statistically significant differences were found between these conditions through analyzing the environments of MCSs and WCS. The 2 m specific humidity stands for the water vapor in the atmosphere which is an essential factor for severe precipitation weather. MK and LFTXS represent a physical mechanism of thermal and instability factors that act to make thunderstorms occur. SWEAT represents the dynamic and thermal conditions that enhance and sustain the development of thunderstorms. The vertical wind shear further enhances upward motion at the leading edge of storm-generated cold pools, which promotes storm interaction and organization. The combination of these mechanisms appears to be the most favorable setting that leads to MCS formation and development.

AB  - What happens in meadows after populations of natural grazers rebound following centuries of low abundance? Many seagrass ecosystems are now experiencing this phenomenon with the recovery of green turtles (Chelonia mydas), large-bodied marine herbivores that feed on seagrasses. These seagrass ecosystems provide a rare opportunity to study ecosystem-wide shifts that result from a recovery of herbivores. We evaluate changes in regulation of seagrass productivity in a naturally grazed tropical ecosystem by (1) comparingThalassia testudinumproductivity in grazed and ungrazed areas and (2) evaluating potential regulating mechanisms ofT. testudinumproductivity. We established 129 green turtle exclusion cages in grazed and ungrazed areas to quantifyT. testudinumgrowth (linear, area, mass, productivity : biomass [P:B]). In each exclosure, we recorded temperature, irradiance, water depth, nitrogen : phosphorus ratio (N:P) of blade tissue, grazing intensity before cage placement, andT. testudinumstructural and nutrient characteristics.Thalassia testudinumexhibited compensatory growth in grazed areas via stimulated blade linear growth, blade area growth, and P:B across seasonal high and low growth periods and in shallow (3-4 m) and deep (9-10 m) seagrass meadows. Irradiance, depth, and N:P ratios had significant roles in regulating mass growth and P:B ofT. testudinumin ungrazed areas. Depth was a significant regulating factor of mass growth and P:B in grazed areas; rates were higher and more variable in shallow meadows than in deep meadows. Grazing intensity was also a significant regulating factor for P:B, stimulating tissue turnover with increasing grazing pressure. This study provides important insights into how recovery of a large marine herbivore can result in dramatic, sustainable changes in the regulation of seagrass productivity. We also highlight the need for a historical perspective and use of appropriate indicators, including P:B and grazing intensity, when evaluating seagrass response to green turtle grazing as meadows are returned to a natural grazed state. In an age of green turtle recovery and global seagrass decline due to anthropogenic threats, a thorough understanding of green turtle-seagrass interactions at the ecosystem level is critical to ensure the restoration of seagrass ecosystems and continued recovery of green turtle populations.

AB  - The article considers the main sources of pollutionin the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania. A study of environmental geophysical factors in the city of Vladikavkaz was carried out at 126 points; indicators of noise pollution, electric fields and the level of gamma radiation were measured. A geoaccumulation index of heavy metals in soils and indices of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks were calculated and corresponding maps were constructed. The obtained data supporting a high level of carcinogenic risk are consistent with a high level of cancer morbidity in the city, which indicates a close relationship between morbidity and the carcinogenic risk index. It has been determined that emissions from road transport are greater by an order of magnitude than stationary sources emissions, while there is a steady trend towards an increase in air pollution as a result of the increasing negative impact of motor vehicle emissions. It has been established that the most hazardous way for heavy metals to enter the human body from the soil is by inhalation. It has been determined that in areas where environmental pollution with heavy metals is higher, cancer morbidity is also higher.

AB  - Long-term ecological research (LTER) sites need a periodic assessment of the state of their ecosystems and services in order to monitor trends and prevent irreversible changes. The ecological integrity (EI) framework opens the door to evaluate any ecosystem in a comparable way, by measuring indicators on ecosystem structure and processes. Such an approach also allows to gauge the sustainability of conservation management actions in the case of protected areas. Remote sensing (RS), provided by satellite, airborne, or drone-borne sensors becomes a very synoptic and valuable tool to quickly map isolated and inaccessible areas such as wetlands. However, few RS practical indicators have been proposed to relate to EI indicators for wetlands. In this work, we suggest several RS wetlands indicators to be used for EI assessment in wetlands and specially to be applied with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We also assess the applicability of multispectral images captured by UAVs over two long-term socio-ecological research (LTSER) wetland sites to provide detailed mapping of inundation levels, water turbidity and depth as well as aquatic plant cover. We followed an empirical approach to find linear relationships between UAVs spectral reflectance and the RS indicators over the Donana LTSER platform in SW Spain. The method assessment was carried out using ground-truth data collected in transects. The resulting empirical models were implemented for Donana marshes and can be applied for the Braila LTSER platform in Romania. The resulting maps are a very valuable input to assess habitat diversity, wetlands dynamics, and ecosystem productivity as frequently as desired by managers or scientists. Finally, we also examined the feasibility to upscale the information obtained from the collected ground-truth data to satellite images from Sentinel-2 MSI using segments from the UAV multispectral orthomosaic. We found a close multispectral relationship between Parrot Sequoia and Sentinel-2 bands which made it possible to extend ground-truth to map inundation in satellite images.

AB  - The concentration of lysozyme in the immune organs of the pike (kidney, spleen, liver, and blood serum) was analyzed. The opposite of the intra-annual fluctuation of the nonspecific immunity indicators in the kidney and the spleen relative to the liver and the serum was found. The highest level of the enzyme in the kidney was observed during the winter months and in spring, and in the serum, it was from spring to autumn. In May, a significant increase in the lysozyme concentration was found in all organs studied and the serum, regardless of the direction of changes in the previous period. The size of the individuals did not affect the lysozyme concentration in the organs, and a correlation with the fish length was found only in the serum. The stages of gonadal maturity in pike showed a multidirectional effect on the enzyme concentration in the kidney and the serum. The intra-annual dynamics of the nonspecific immunity indicator in adult fish has a seasonal dependence, including a dependence on the water temperature in the water body. In the liver and serum, the relationship between the enzyme and temperature is direct, and it is the opposite in the kidney and spleen. Studies have shown that the seasonal dynamics of the lysozyme concentration in pike is influenced by a set of parameters characterizing the physiological state of fish and environmental factors. Serum lysozyme was found to be more dependent on various factors than the enzyme from the organs.

AB  - The emerging threat to the coastal urban ecosystems from increased intensity and frequency of weather events is a compelling reason for improving our understanding of the integrity of the existing ecosystem. Resilience of an ecosystem is a critical property that aids recovery and adaptation when subject to intense stress. Quantifying the resilience of an ecological system requires a detailed understanding of the vulnerabilities and interactions within a complex web of interconnected social, technological and economic networks. Through an ecological network analysis of ascendency and redundancy of the flux of energy and material flows, the causal relationships are established through structural equations modeling (SEM) techniques. A model based-on the five factors of driving force (D), pressure (P), state (S), impact (I), and response (R) (DPSIR), recognizes the different roles these factors play in the coastal urban ecological security system of China. Energy and material flows transmission equations of the ecological security network are developed to evaluate the resilience of the ecological security network. The results show that the ecological security network of Chinese coastal cities has a relatively high network occupation rate (A/C = 0.6898), indicating a relatively mature state of the ecological security network of coastal cities with sufficient metabolic capacity and steady status. The low vacancy rate (R/C = 0.3102) shows that the coastal ecological security network lacks flexibility of surplus space. The energy and material flows conversion and dissipation ability in the network are strong: the live factors of DPSIR are highly interdependent, and the ecological security network framework is both steady and mature. However, the resilience of the coastal urban ecosystem against external impacts is weak. It is critical for coastal cities to broaden their planning protocols to introduce more flexible space to increase resilience and guarantee a robust pathway for sustainable development This study contributes to a rational method for testing the internal causal relationships among DPSIR linkages toward quantifying our understanding of the resilience of a security ecosystem.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive legislates for sustainable, catchment level water management across the European Union. Principal goals of the Directive are that water bodies achieve Good status by 2015 and the use of biological quality elements in routine monitoring of surface water bodies.
   The bryophytes form a significant biotic component of riparian systems and can be associated with particular environmental conditions. Detailed studies on riparian Macaronesian bryophytes are lacking, in particular on the island of Madeira.
   This study outlines associations between within-stream bryophytes and key physicochemical water parameters in the streams of Madeira island. Bryofloristic characterization, results of ecological status and conservation interest of the habitats from Madeira's principal streams, describing possible measures for the sustainable management of these areas are covered. Bryophytes were found to be effective bioindicators of water quality in these unique Macaronesian riparian habitats and suitable biological quality elements for WFD compliant biomonitoring programmes.
   Results show that stream reaches classified as having High Ecological Status were mostly located on the northern slopes of the island, in upstream sections ot the streans, where the indigenous Laurisilva or heath forests predominate. These areas represent reference conditions forming the basis for the development and implementation of future restoration measures in degraded streams with the same typology. Sections classified as having Bad Ecological Status were situated in urban areas with higher levels of human intervention, subjected to various types of contamination which was reflected in the physicochemical parameters. Such areas are clearly degraded and should be restored through programmes of measures laid out in mandatory WFD River Basin Management Plans. The findings from this study present a contribution towards achieving Good ecological status as stated in the WFD, based on the Madeiran bryoflora.

AB  - The concept of nature as capital is gaining visibility in policies and practices in both the public and private sectors. This change is due to an improved ability to assess and value ecosystem services, as well as to a growing recognition of the potential of an ecosystem services approach to make tradeoffs in decision making more transparent, inform efficient use of resources, enhance resilience and sustainability, and avoid unintended negative consequences of policy actions. Globally, governments, financial institutions, and corporations have begun to incorporate natural capital accounting in their policies and practices. In the United States, universities, nongovernmental organizations, and federal agencies are actively collaborating to develop and apply ecosystem services concepts to further national environmental and economic objectives. Numerous federal agencies have begun incorporating these concepts into land use planning, water resources management, and preparations for, and responses to, climate change. Going forward, well-defined policy direction will be necessary to institutionalize ecosystem services approaches in federal agencies, as well as to guide intersector and interdisciplinary collaborative research and development efforts. In addition, a new generation of decision support tools are needed to further the practical application of ecosystem services principles in policymaking and commercial activities. Improved performance metrics are needed, as are mechanisms to monitor the status of ecosystem services and assess the environmental and economic impacts of policies and programs. A greater national and international financial commitment to advancing ecosystem services and natural capital accounting would likely have broad, long-term economic and environmental benefits.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the application of ecological models to improve the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of toxicants. For this study, the AQUATOX model was implemented using 18 pelagic and benthic populations derived from field data obtained at Baiyangdian Lake between April 2009 and March 2010. The model was evaluated to examine its utility in assessing the ecological risk of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in aquatic ecosystems. Model parameters were calibrated to simulate the complex seasonal patterns of Baiyangdian Lake biomass populations. Sensitivity analysis revealed the potential importance of indirect effects and demonstrated the vital role of parameter values in determining the biomass of each trophic level. The model was highly sensitive to parameters related to temperature limitations and respiration rates. Moreover, it was effective in estimating risks associated with the direct toxic PCB effects of each population and the indirect ecological effects distributed through the coupled pelagic-benthic food web. Benchmarks derived from AQUATOX-Baiyangdian were approximately one order of magnitude less than the benchmarks derived from NOEC in a report by the United States of America's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Comparison analysis determined the model could provide a good basis in ascertaining ecological protection levels of "chemicals of concern" for aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, AQUATOX can potentially be used to provide necessary information corresponding to early warning and rapid forecasting of pollutant transport and fate in the management of chemicals that put aquatic ecosystems at risk.

AB  - While increased tourist demand has brought economic benefits to tourist destinations, it has also put tremendous pressure on tourism-related ecological environments. Therefore, the relationship between regional urban tourism's economic benefits and tourism ecologies must be considered by increasing the ecological security levels of regional urban tourism and promoting sustainable tourism development. This paper defines the ecological security of regional urban tourism, constructs an indicator system of said ecological security based on a pressure-state-response social-economic-environment (PSR-SEE) model, uses the entropy method to objectively assign weights to the indicator system, constructs a dynamic multi-scenario simulation model to assess ecological security under continuous, economic priority and various ecological protection scenarios, employs ArcGIS software to analyze the spatial distribution patterns of the ecological security of regional urban tourism, and uses a standard deviation ellipse method to analyze the space-time evolutionary track of the ecological security of regional urban tourism. The index system is applied to 16 cities in Hubei Province to measure the ecological security levels and test the viability of the system. The present research focuses on the space-time evolution of the ecological security of regional urban tourism, addresses the contradictions between socioeconomic development and the ecological security of regional urban tourism, provides an important reference for tourism destination planning, and can assist in improving the levels of the ecological security of regional urban tourism to promote sustainable tourism development.

AB  - Concurrently high values of the maximum potential wind speed of updrafts (W-max) and 0-6km wind shear (Shear) have been found to represent conducive environments for severe weather, which subsequently provides a way to study severe weather in future climates. Here, we employ a model for the product of these variables (WmSh) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research/United States National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis over North America conditioned on their having extreme energy in the spatial field in order to project the predominant spatial patterns of WmSh. The approach is based on the Heffernan and Tawn conditional extreme value model. Results suggest that this technique estimates the spatial behavior of WmSh well, which allows for exploring possible changes in the patterns over time. While the model enables a method for inferring the uncertainty in the patterns, such analysis is difficult with the currently available inference approach. A variation of the method is also explored to investigate how this type of model might be used to qualitatively understand how the spatial patterns of WmSh correspond to extreme river flow events. A case study for river flows from three rivers in northwestern Tennessee is studied, and it is found that advection of WmSh from the Gulf of Mexico prevails while elsewhere, WmSh is generally very low during such extreme events.

AB  - To date, there are a high volume of studies concerning climate change impact assessments in ecosystems. Meta-analysis, scenario development, and causal chains/loops have been used as tools in these assessments as well as in decision making either individually or combined in pairs. There exists a need to develop decision support tools that improve the linkage between climate-impacts research and planning, management, adaptation, and mitigation decisions by providing quantitative and timely information to stakeholders and managers. The overall goal is to address this need. A specific objective was to develop a decision support tool in eco-hydrological applications that combine three components: meta-analysis, scenario development, and causal chains/loop. The developed tool is novel, warranted, and timely. The use of the tool is demonstrated for Florida. The meta-analysis of 32 studies revealed precipitation changes ranged between +30% and -40%, and temperature changes ranged from +6 degrees C to -3 degrees C for Florida. Seven incremental scenarios were developed at 10% increments in the precipitation change range and nine scenarios with 1 degrees C increments in the temperature change range (driving forces). The causal chains/loops were developed using Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework for selected ecosystems and environment (e.g., agroecosystem, mangroves, water resources, and sea turtles) in Florida. The driving force puts pressure on the ecosystem or environment impacting their state, which in turn had a response (e.g., mitigation and adaptation strategies). The framework used indicators selected from studies on climate impact assessments (meta-analysis and others) for the selected ecosystems as well as author expertise on the topic to develop the chains/loops. The decision tool is applicable to stakeholders and any ecosystem within and outside of Florida.

AB  - Measures of seabird breeding success are often used as bio-indicators for the state of the marine environment. For many seabirds, productivity is estimated by averaging data from a number of survey plots. This may lead to evidence of change being confounded if plots differ in the factors affecting productivity. To test for such differences, the productivity of the Common Guillemot Uria aalge was monitored at four plots on Skomer Island in 2011 and 2012. The relationship between site openness and breeding success varied between plots, and the plots themselves differed in productivity. At three plots, open sites had lower breeding success than more protected sites, but at one plot, no relationship was observed between site openness and productivity. Analysis of historical data revealed inter-plot differences in the relationships between productivity and the number of breeding birds in a plot. At only one plot was there evidence consistent with the theory that increasing numbers of breeding birds lowered productivity by forcing the use of more open sites. Inter-plot differences mean that evidence of changes in productivity may be confounded in estimates based on data from multiple plots. Specifically, increasing populations may act to reduce productivity at some plots but not at others. Simple analyses of site openness, breeding success and breeding numbers can provide important information about the factors driving changes in Guillemot productivity.

AB  - Ecological thresholds, associated with abrupt changes in the state and organisation of ecosystems, challenge both scientists and managers. Adaptive response to such changes, and planning for their occurrence, requires an understanding of the underlying drivers and system responses as well as appropriate monitoring. In addition to field studies, modelling can advance our ability to anticipate or deal with such major ecosystem shifts. Here, we used an existing multi species model with smooth continuous functions that were modified to include thresholds representing 3 alternative scenarios of predator responses when prey numbers drop below a critical threshold: (I) no threshold-like response; (II) an abrupt decrease in breeding success by 90%, and (III) an abrupt halving of adult survival. Second, we analysed field observations from 3 independent marine case studies (abalone, starfish, penguins) for evidence of abrupt non-linear responses of predators to changes in abundance of principal prey. Third, we compared the model output with empirical results and tested (using both a statistical method and by fitting multispecies models) the 3 alternative response scenarios. With this approach, we found evidence for nonlinear changes in population parameters (such as survival rate) of predators as prey numbers declined below critical thresholds. As an example of the potential for this approach to inform management, we found that abundances of a range of marine predators become more variable as prey numbers decline, which may be a useful indicator that a system is approaching a tipping point.

AB  - The definition of coastal waters in relation to the European Union (EU) environmental legislation was clearly stated in the Water Framework Directive. In compliance with this Directive, most of the EU Member States have delineated their coastal waters' boundaries. However, these delineations are not as complete and homogeneous as could be expected. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive and unambiguous delimitation of European coastal waters. This paper aims at bridging this gap, providing a pan-European mapping of coastal waters, covering 553,817 km(2) in 30 seaside countries, 340,524 km(2) of which pertain to the 22 EU Member States connected to the sea. For this purpose, a comprehensive geographical analysis of the national baselines and transitional waters distribution was performed. A pan-European baseline of 63,340 km was delineated, together with the coastal waters delimitation (the final GIS layers are provided as supplementary material of this article). The results show significant differences between the available national declarations of coastal waters and the areas identified in this work (almost 12% of the compared area), the former defining an additional 29,337 km(2) of coastal waters with respect to the latter. The largest deviations seem to be due either to misinterpretations of the definition of coastal waters, or to one-sided national modifications. A clear identification of European coastal water boundaries is crucial for the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive implementations, which depend on an accurate ecological/environmental assessment of those waters.

AB  - The current alarming state of many coastal ecosystems and fisheries calls for the development of tools to support recovery of exploited stocks, ensure their sustainable exploitation and protect marine ecosystems. Multi-zone Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are often advocated to reconcile conservation and fisheries benefits. However, while there is a consensus about the ecological benefits whether such types of MPAs can really provide both benefits is still uncertain. Here, we analysed three existing Northwestern Mediterranean multi-zone MPAs (Cerbere-Banyuls, Cap de Creus and Medes Islands) using a comparative temporal ecosystem modelling approach to assess their effectiveness over time in recovering marine resources and ecosystem in the area. Our results showed differences in the ecological effectiveness of the three MPAs, potentially driven by MPA design, management and implementation features. Temporal increases of benefits were small, whenever detected, and showed slight recoveries of some target species and ecological indicators, mostly in Cerbere-Banyuls and Medes Islands MPAs. Our results confirm the benefits of protection to coastal marine resources and ecosystems when MPAs are enforced but highlight the current limitations of the three MPAs due to their small size and the significant impacts of small-scale and recreational fisheries. This study illustrates the capability to evaluate protection effects of small multi-zone MPAs with an ecosystem modelling perspective and represents the baseline to develop future scenarios of alternative management options to foster ecosystem recovery and resource rebuilding in the studied MPAs.

AB  - Why do some exotic plant species become invasive? Two common hypotheses, increased resource availability and enemy release, may more effectively explain invasion if they favor the same species, and therefore act in concert. This would be expected if plant species adapted to high levels of available resources in their native range are particularly susceptible to enemies, and therefore benefit most from a paucity of enemies in their new range. We tested this possibility by examining how resource adaptations influence pathogen richness and release among 243 European plant species naturalized in the United States. Plant species adapted to higher resource availability hosted more pathogen species in their native range. Plants from mesic environments hosted more fungi than plants from xeric environments, and plants from nitrogen-rich environments hosted more viruses than plants from nitrogen-poor environments. Furthermore, plants classified as competitors hosted more than 4 times as many fungi and viruses as did stress tolerators. Patterns of enemy release mirrored those of pathogen richness: competitors and species from mesic and nitrogen-rich environments were released from many pathogen species, while stress tolerators and species from xeric and nitrogen-poor environments were released from relatively few pathogen species. These results suggest that enemy release contributes most to invasion by fast-growing species adapted to resource-rich environments. Consequently, enemy release and increases in resource availability may act synergistically to favor exotic over native species.

AB  - One difficulty in protecting historical and cultural cities in developing countries is the need to improve both the level of urban sustainable development and the rational use of historical and cultural resources. Currently, the city development index (CDI) ignores the fact that urban resources are being consumed at a rapidly increasing rate, and it is further unable to measure the coordination between urban development and ecosystems. The case study selected Xi'an, and calculated its CDI and ecological footprint per capita (ef), carbon footprint per capita (cf) and water footprint per capita (wf) in 2007-2017. A decoupling analysis was applied. The results showed only an 18.29% increase in the CDI, while the increase in the per capita values of the footprint family indicators are 38.97%, 44.41%, and 42.95%, respectively, which characterize the conflict between developing cities and maintaining urban ecosystems. There is no real decoupling between the CDI and the footprint family indicators, reflecting the dynamic reciprocal characteristics of "strong decoupling, expansive decoupling, weak decoupling, recessive decoupling" and indicating a very unstable situation. The analysis confirmed that the changes in the CDI and the footprint family indicators are the same as the left half of the inverted "U" of the "Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)" that has not yet reached its "inflection point". This discovery helps to focus attention on the role of restoring urban ecosystems to support urban development. To this end, policy suggestions are proposed to improve urban land use efficiency, encourage low-carbon energy structure to improve energy use efficiency, improve urban carbon sequestration capacity, and implement differential water prices. This study compensates for the inability of the CDI to express the state of urban ecosystems and helps enhance the understanding of the inclusive sustainable development of cities in developing countries, which embodies human well-being.

AB  - The Suwannee River watershed is one of the least developed in the eastern United States, but with increasing urbanization it is facing potential long-term alterations in freshwater flow to its estuary in the Gulf of Mexico. The purpose of this study was to develop biological indicators of oyster reef state along a natural salinity gradient in the Suwannee River estuary in order to allow the rapid assessment of the effect of changing freshwater input to this system. Percent cover and density of three size classes of living oysters, as well as the abundance of several predominant reef-associated invertebrates, were measured along a broad salinity gradient in the estuary and were correlated with salinity estimates from a long-term database for the preceding 12-24 mo. All eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, parameters (percent cover and density of three size classes) were significantly and negatively related to salinity. Data from samples collected near the lower intertidal were more closely dependent upon salinity than were samples from the higher intertidal at the same sites. Salinity differences were most closely reflected in differences in total oyster cover. This relationship corresponded with a general decline in oyster habitat with increasing distance from the mouth of the Suwannee River. Species richness was significantly and positively correlated with all C virginica parameters (percent cover and density of three size classes), but the relationship explained only about half the variability. Density data of the hooked mussel, Ischadium recurvum and a mud crab, Eurypanopeus depressus, were positively and strongly correlated with C virginica parameters, likely reflecting the abundance of habitat provided by C virginiva shells. All of the biological indicators measured responded similarly along the salinity gradient, indicating they provide reliable indices of the effect of changing salinities in the Suwannee River estuary over the previous I or 2 yr. Some areas of positive relief defined as reefs 30 years ago are no longer oyster habitat, suggesting an ongoing decline, but nearshore C virginica were abundant.

AB  - This paper reviews water-borne soil erosion in Australia in the context of current environmental policy needs. Sustainability has emerged as a central tenet of environmental policy in Australia and waterborne hillslope soil erosion rates are used as one of the indicators of agricultural sustainability in State of the Environment reporting. We review attempts to quantify hillslope erosion rates over Australia and we identify areas at risk of exceeding natural baseline rates. We also review historical definitions of sustainable, or 'tolerable' erosion rates, and how to set these rates. There are many ways to estimate hillslope erosion and these can create confusing results. Moreover their application for land management purposes requires nuanced interpretations that ultimately depend on the desired objective of decision-makers. Soil is the earth surficial material that serves as a medium for plant growth and the notion of tolerable soil erosion arose historically to assess the impact of soil loss on agricultural uses. However now that the impact of erosion on aquatic ecosystems been recognized as a major concern for Australia, the concept of tolerable erosion needs to be revised. Here we discuss three definitions of tolerable soil erosion, following recent literature. We derive estimates of long-term agricultural sustainability based on natural soil production rates and discuss this in relation to other defined land-management objectives such as aquatic ecosystem health. We conclude that the desired objectives of land managers must be clearly articulated before questions of 'where to invest to control erosion' and 'how to assess return-on-investment' can be answered.

AB  - A review of the literature on the selection of optimal indicators for the integrated assessment of surface water quality is given. The restriction of the amount of polluting ingredients analyzed in the water is indicated in the Kazhydromet system, which to a certain extent results in a water quality assessment of the results that do not correspond to the actual ecological and toxicological state of the reservoir.
   The need for state monitoring of the level of accumulation and spread of persistent organic pollutants (POPs): organochlorine pesticides (CVD) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the water bodies of the Republic of Kazakhstan is reasonably justified on the basis of: high toxicity for living organisms and the environment, extreme stability in natural environments, active migration capacity in nature and trofical chains, existing in the RK, powerful sources of pollution of natural and water bodies, pollution the strict adherence to the Stockholm Convention on POPs, ratified by it in 2007. Contamination with these dangerous xenobiotics of some reservoirs of the Russian Federation and a number of large water objects of the Republic of Kazakhstan is shown on the basis of a generalization of the literary data, as well as the results of the author's own research into various periods. The level of contamination of water, biological resources and atmospheric precipitation of the Ile-Balkhash basin with highly toxic PCBs is graphically illustrated on the basis of the monograph on POPs published in Kazakhstan for the first time.
   On the basis of irrefutable scientific data, the need to monitor the dynamics of POPs for objective assessment of water quality in the water bodies of the Republic of Kazakhstan, especially large transboundary water basins, is proved.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the effects of various petroleum-derived substances (PDSs), namely petrol, diesel fuel, and spent engine oil, on life history traits of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi L., and on the growth and chemical composition of its host plant-winter wheat Triticum aestivum L. Each substance was tested separately, using two concentrations (9 and 18 g kg(-1)). Plants were cultivated in both control and contaminated soils. In early October 2013, soil was contaminated and after 1 week, winter wheat seeds, 'Batuta' cultivar, were sown. In early June 2014, observations of the effect of petroleum-derived substances on traits of three successive generations of aphids were conducted. Aphids were inoculated separately on leaves using cylindrical cages hermetically closed on both sides. Contamination of aphid occurred through its host plant. Results showed that all of the applied petroleum-derived substances have a generally adverse effect on the developmental parameters in aphids, resulting in the decrease of its fecundity, shortening its average life span, and most often lowering of the population intrinsic growth rate. PDSs caused the limitation of growth in wheat plants; whereas, changes in nutrient contents and heavy metals depended on the part of the plant analysed, the substance applied, and on its dose. The negative relationships between the contents of both some macro-elements (Ca, K, P) and heavy metals (Mn, Cd, Cu, and Zn) and the developmental parameters of particular generations of R. padi were observed. The high susceptibility of R. padi to the presence of PDSs in the substrate for the host plant should be emphasised-the clear-cut changes in the life span and fecundity, with relatively small changes in the chemical composition of the plant, constitute an evident indication that the developmental parameters of aphids have the potential for the use as bio-indicator to evaluate the state of the environment contaminated by PDSs.

AB  - After committing an error, humans often adopt strategies to change error behaviors, this phenomenon is termed post-error adjustment. The post-error adjustment ability is fundamental to flexible behavior and survival in a complex, varying environment. Resting-state neural activity has been associated with a variety of cognitive abilities, yet its relevance to post-error adjustment has been unclear.
   Resting-state fMRI is a powerful tool for investigating this spontaneous brain activity, since it can reveal the correlation of the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain and the extrinsic behavior performance. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF, 0.01-0.08 Hz) is widely used as an indicator of spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity. It has been suggested to reflect individual differences in cognitive control and personality traits. Therefore, the investigation of the spontaneous brain activity related to the post-error adjustment will provide novel insight into the understanding of the generation mechanism of post-error adjustment.
   The current study employed a modified Go/NoGo task to investigate the intrinsic neural correlates of post-error adjustment by analyzing the ALFF. To yield a sufficient number of error trials, we instructed subjects to withhold their responses in two circumstances. (1) When word meaning and the font color of word were inconsistent, this trial was termed as incongruent Nogo; (2) when a word was presented on two consecutive trials (same meaning and same font color). Considering previous studies have demonstrated that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral insula play an important role in the error monitoring and error adaptation, thus the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula were selected as the regions of interest (ROIs) in the present study. Additionally, the small volume correction was performed for multiple comparison. Moreover, since low-frequency fluctuations in the gray matter were higher than those in the white matter, the ALFF was calculated only in the gray matter.
   As a result, the ALFF-behavior analysis revealed that the magnitude of post-error adjustment in reaction time was not correlated with the ALFF in ACC. However, the magnitude of post-error adjustment in reaction time was positively associated with the ALFF in bilateral insula. Specifically, stronger spontaneous neuronal activity in bilateral insula corresponded to slower post-error adjustments. Together, the findings suggest that spontaneous activity in the bilateral insula may be the neural indicator of the individual difference in post-error adjustment, which may predict the adjustive time of post-error behavior.

AB  - A high quality data collection has been carried out between 2004 and 2014 to develop the first trophic ECOPATH model for the functioning of the sub and intertidal zones of Ria de Aveiro. This schematic representation allows the characterization of the most important compartments of biomass and flows of energy representing the functioning of the ecosystem, and can be used in the fields of decision-making and management. The model considered 26 functional groups from primary producers to top-predators and two different fisheries (artisanal and leisure), and showed that Ria de Aveiro is a dynamic ecosystem dominated by a high biomass of primary producers, where the transference of energy among compartments is, to a large extent, accomplished through the detritus path. The model also provides several ecological indicators on the state of maturity of the ecosystem, showing that Ria de Aveiro is in an intermediate state of maturity with a relatively complex food web and resilience to environmental changes. As discussed, this state of maturity is probably determined by human action pervading the system to advance in the expectable ecological succession of a coastal lagoon. These aspects, together with indicators of elevated fishing pressure and predation within the system, underline the necessity of controlling illegal extraction activities and monitoring the biomass of the main functional groups of the system, especially top predators, in order to keep the functioning of the ecosystem of Ria de Aveiro in its current condition.

AB  - Throughout Japan, numerous restoration projects and efforts to conserve the river environment are underway. However, in spite of such efforts, effective measures to conserve the river ecosystem or post-evaluation of restoration projects remain insufficient due to a lack of environmental indicators. In many European countries and the United States, a number of biological indicators have been developed and adapted. However, it appears to be difficult to directly apply these indicators to Japan, because its biota is finely classified according to its many islands and peninsulas. The ultimate goal of this study is to comprehensively evaluate indicators of aquatic biodiversity from both physical and biological aspects. We divided the Kyushu region in Japan into several ecoregions as a preliminary step to establish an indicator. We delineated the ecoregions of the Kyushu region using the fish fauna data of 21 rivers within the Kyushu region. Presence-absence (0/1) data for each fish species were used to run a two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN analysis). As a result, the Kyushu region was divided into four ecoregions (A: northwest Kyushu, B1: northeast Kyushu, B2: south Kyushu, and C: Amami-Oshima Island). Each ecoregion was characterized by the following fish species: (A) Cyprinidae, in particular Acheilognathinae, is abundant; (B1) Gobiidae is abundant, while Cyprinidae such as Tanakia limbata (not confirmed in B2) are also present; (B2) Gobiidae is abundant, while Rhingobius sp. DA and Rhingobius sp. CO (not confirmed in B1) are present. These results indicate that the fish fauna of the Kyushu region is finely delineated, and that an assessment standard for biological integrity should be established, based on differences in fish fauna.

AB  - The United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals have articulated sustainable development requirements at the international level. SDG14: life below water, has in particular, provided a future pathway for sustainable development of the ocean environment. With the establishment of this global perspective has come a renewed emphasis on the need for global ocean knowledge production. The 2015 First World Ocean Assessment (FWOA), which was produced by the first cycle of the United Nations' Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socio-economic Aspects, is widely viewed as a primary tool to guiding action on SDG14. This research investigates how effective the FWOA has been at supporting these efforts toward sustainable development of the ocean environment. We use a combination of approaches, including document mining, an internationally distributed survey and semi-structured interviews to better understand the impact of the FWOA as well as the interrelated functioning of the Regular Process' first cycle. While the FWOA was successful in compiling well accepted and credible ocean information, it was unable to generate the impact on sustainable ocean management activities that had originally been expected of it. Funding restrictions, participation issues and political anxieties seemed to derail the first cycle of the Regular Process from initial recommendations and directed the process into unorthodox operations and substantial political control. With the Second World Ocean Assessment (SWOA) well underway, it is imperative that trust is built and social learning is encouraged between participants in the Regular Process.

AB  - Demands for management advice on mixed and multispecies fisheries pose many challenges, further complicated by corresponding requests for advice on the environmental impacts of alternate management options. Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam trawl, otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and otter trawl fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam trawl yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to F-MSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment.

AB  - Amethodology for mapping ecosystems and their potential development under climate change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition was developed using examples from Germany. The methodology integrated data on vegetation, soil, climate change and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. These data were used to classify ecosystem types regarding six ecological functions and interrelated structures. Respective data covering 1961-1990 were used for reference. The assessment of functional and structural integrity relies on comparing a current or future state with an ecosystem type-specific reference. While current functions and structures of ecosystems were quantified by measurements, potential future developments were projected by geochemical soil modelling and data from a regional climate change model.
   The ecosystem types referenced the potential natural vegetation and were mapped using data on current tree species coverage and land use. In this manner, current ecosystem types were derived, which were related to data on elevation, soil texture, and climate for the years 1961-1990. These relations were quantified by Classification and Regression Trees, which were used to map the spatial patterns of ecosystem type clusters for 1961-1990. The climate data for these years were subsequently replaced by the results of a regional climate model for 1991-2010, 2011-2040, and 2041-2070. For each of these periods, one map of ecosystem type clusters was produced and evaluated with regard to the development of areal coverage of ecosystem type clusters over time. This evaluation of the structural aspects of ecological integrity at the national level was added by projecting potential future values of indicators for ecological functions at the site level by using the Very Simple Dynamic soil modelling technique based on climate data and two scenarios of nitrogen deposition as input. The results were compared to the reference and enabled an evaluation of site-specific ecosystem changes over time which proved to be both, positive and negative. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Welsh et al. [Welsh, H.H., Jr. Pope, K.L., Wheeler, C.A., 2008. Using multiple metrics to assess the effects of forest succession on population status: a comparative study of two terrestrial salamanders in the US Pacific Northwest. Biological Conservation 141, pp. 1149-1160] argued for the use of four metrics to monitor population status of two terrestrial amphibians, the Siskiyou Mountains (Plethodon stormi) and Del Norte (Plethodon elongatus) salamanders. We show that inherent problems exist with Welsh et al.'s application of all four of these metrics, and that their inferences about population status are likely to be uncertain as a consequence and potentially misleading to managers. Welsh et al. (2008) used data from different populations and different years to estimate detection probabilities for both P. elongatus and P. stormi, a decision which assumes that detection probabilities do not differ across sites and populations are closed. In addition, Welsh et al. (2008) present count data for both salamanders, a metric that assumes capture probability does not vary by age, gender, size, other individual characteristics, and most importantly in their application, habitat characteristics. Welsh et al. (2008) estimated survival based upon age ratios. Age ratios are known to be biased when immigration and emigration are unequal Conn et al. [Conn, P.B., Doherty, P.F., Jr. Nichols, J.D., 2005. Comparative demography of New World populations of thrushes (Turdus spp.): comment. Ecology 86, pp. 2536-2541]. In source-sink systems, immigration and emigration are expected to be unequal. Thus, the use of this estimation technique to characterize survival in source-sink systems is invalid unless it can be shown that immigration and emigration are equal, a rare occurrence in source-sink systems. The final metric used by Welsh et al. (2008) was an index of body condition, i.e., the residuals of a least squares regression of mass on the length. Several recent articles have outlined a number of potential problems with the technique and a theoretically more robust and efficient alternative has been published. Unfortunately, Welsh et al. (2008) did not provide the details (model diagnostic statistics, tests of assumptions) needed to assess whether or not their analyses of body condition may be accurate. We think that evaluation of specific hypotheses, well-designed sampling programs, and methods such as mark-recapture and ratio sampling are more likely to provide reliable inference than re-analysis of old data sets that were collected for other purposes and obsolete methods (i.e.. counting individuals on single occasions) that are known to be flawed. We agree that potential forest management impacts to sensitive taxa require evaluation and monitoring, and that changes in occupancy and abundance are useful metrics for this task (while recognizing that, when feasible to collect, information about reproductive success and survival is superior). However, reliable inference about potential impacts can only be made if reliable methods are employed and if critical assumptions receive empirical evaluation. We offer several suggestions to strengthen inference about management treatments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Threadfin porgyEvynnis cardinalisis both a dominant fish species and an important fishing target in bottom trawl fisheries in the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea. It was listed as endangered (EN) in a recent International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Despite its economic importance and endangered status, limited research on its biological characteristics and spatial-temporal distribution has been undertaken this last decade, creating uncertainty in current conservation and management. We analyse this species' spatial distribution characteristics using data from four seasonal bottom trawl surveys in 2014-2015, and report average catch per unit effort to vary seasonally, from 49.1 to 594.5 ind h(-1). Growth, mortality and sexual maturity are reported for four time periods based on data from bottom trawl fishery surveys over 1961-1962, 1998-1999, 2006, and 2014-2015. Length frequency distributions changed from bimodal to unimodal, and the female-to-male ratio increased. Mean body length and length at first maturity decreased, whereas the growth coefficient increased, indicating miniaturization, early sexual maturity and accelerated growth, respectively.We report sparid catch to have first exceeded maximum sustainable yield in 2001, and to have remained overfished from 2010 to 2015. Since the 1980s, low-trophic-level fishes such asE. cardinalishave replaced high-trophic-level fishes such as Crimson snapperLutjanus erythropterusto become dominant species. As catches have increased substantially, these species have been faced with overfishing, driving the ecosystem into an unstable state.

AB  - The paper presents the study results of multi-year dynamics of forests of the Darwin Reserve, influenced by the Rybinsk Reservoir under the conditions of the changed natural environment. The reservoir is a powerful ecological factor, which implies the need to study the state of coastal ecosystems. The tendencies and patterns of their dynamics have been poorly studied. Investigations of forests growing under conditions of long-term influence of the reservoir are based on the principles of dynamic typology, which have been well tested by I.S. Melekhov in studying the early stages of life of anthropogenic forests. For the first time, we have obtained data for mature and overmature forests. They introduce significant changes in the concept of sustainability of the forest type in the stage of a mature forest stand, or the formed type of forest. The object of research is berry green-moss pine forest, growing on the low ridge among swamp sphagnum forests in the zone of indirect influence of the reservoir. The research objective is to demonstrate the accelerated processes of forest growth and development in the conditions of the changed natural environment. The method of procedure consists in a detailed description and analysis of all components of the phytocenosis. We pay special attention to the stand both as an edificator of the forest type and live ground cover and as an indicator of soil and hydrological conditions. On the basis of materials obtained over a 70-year period and in terms of dynamic typology we have come to a conclusion to consider a berry green-moss pine forest as a stage of relatively accelerated formation of a new forest type. a bilberry green-moss pine forest. This type has a tendency to change pine by spruce in a new generation and the development of a bogging process. These conclusions, confirming the provisions of I.S. Melekhov's dynamic typology, are important for forest science and practice when conducting monitoring studies in the reserve.

AB  - Incorporating ecosystem services into management decisions is a promising means to link conservation and human well-being. Nonetheless, planning and management in Hawai'i, a state with highly valued natural capital, has yet to broadly utilize an ecosystem service approach. We conducted a stakeholder assessment, based on semi-structured interviews, with terrestrial (n = 26) and marine (n = 27) natural resource managers across the State of Hawai'i to understand the current use of ecosystem services (ES) knowledge and decision support tools and whether, how, and under what contexts, further development would potentially be useful. We found that ES knowledge and tools customized to Hawai'i could be useful for communication and outreach, justifying management decisions, and spatial planning. Greater incorporation of this approach is clearly desired and has a strong potential to contribute to more sustainable decision making and planning in Hawai'i and other oceanic island systems. However, the unique biophysical, socio-economic, and cultural context of Hawai'i, and other island systems, will require substantial adaptation of existing ES tools. Based on our findings, we identified four key opportunities for the use of ES knowledge and tools in Hawai'i: (1) linking native forest protection to watershed health; (2) supporting sustainable agriculture; (3) facilitating ridge-to-reef management; and (4) supporting statewide terrestrial and marine spatial planning. Given the interest expressed by natural resource managers, we envision broad adoption of ES knowledge and decision support tools if knowledge and tools are tailored to the Hawaiian context and coupled with adequate outreach and training.

AB  - In temperate and northern ecosystems where there are pronounced seasonal patterns in weather and available energy, there are corresponding patterns of body condition among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Body condition of white-tailed deer can affect survival and reproduction, which has large repercussions for state-level natural resource agencies that allocate hunting permits. In this study, we investigated how variation in winter weather, spring phenology, habitat composition, and browse quantity affected white-tailed deer body condition across a large spatial scale. Several body condition indicators (e.g., carcass mass, heart fat, antler size) were measured by hunters for 795 deer during September-December 2016-2018 in Wisconsin, USA. Winter severity in the previous year was an unreliable predictor of fall body condition of deer when winters were considered mild or moderate. The timing of spring green-up had a consistent effect on the body condition of all age and sex classes of deer. Earlier spring green-up resulted in heavier fawns and larger antlers among adult males. Region and spring green-up interacted to affect the heart fat of adult females. Earlier springs resulted in adult females in northern and central Wisconsin having a higher probability of heavy heart fat, whereas spring green-up had no effect on adult female heart fat in southern Wisconsin. Effects of habitat differed by age and sex class of deer, and by the body condition metric being evaluated, indicating that there are important physiological differences among age and sex classes of deer that are affected by the environment. Our study demonstrates that the hunting public can contribute large-scale, cost-effective, and quality data to deer monitoring and research projects. It is important that natural resource agencies be able to identify and recruit highly engaged members of the hunting public to ensure project success. The timing of spring green-up can have lasting effects on deer health that can be consistently observed the following fall, which is in contrast to the effects of winter severity that did not appear to persist when previous winters were mild or moderate. We encourage managers in northern or temperate regions to consider measures of spring green-up timing in conjunction with traditional winter severity when making deer population management decisions, such as antlerless tag allocation.

AB  - Scenario analyses have been used in multiple science-policy assessments to better understand complex plausible futures. Scenario archetype approaches are based on the fact that many future scenarios have similar underlying storylines, assumptions, and trends in drivers of change, which allows for grouping of scenarios into typologies, or archetypes, facilitating comparisons between a large range of studies. The use of scenario archetypes in environmental assessments foregrounds important policy questions and can be used to codesign interventions tackling future sustainability issues. Recently, scenario archetypes were used in four regional assessments and one ongoing global assessment within the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The aim of these assessments was to provide decision makers with policy-relevant knowledge about the state of biodiversity, ecosystems, and the contributions they provide to people. This paper reflects on the usefulness of the scenario archetype approach within science-policy processes, drawing on the experience from the IPBES assessments. Using a thematic analysis of (a) survey data collected from experts involved in the archetype analyses across IPBES assessments, (b) notes from IPBES workshops, and (c) regional assessment chapter texts, we synthesize the benefits, challenges, and frontiers of applying the scenario archetype approach in a science-policy process. Scenario archetypes were perceived to allow syntheses of large amounts of information for scientific, practice-, and policy-related purposes, streamline key messages from multiple scenario studies, and facilitate communication of them to end users. In terms of challenges, they were perceived as subjective in their interpretation, oversimplifying information, having a limited applicability across scales, and concealing contextual information and novel narratives. Finally, our results highlight what methodologies, applications, and frontiers in archetype-based research should be explored in the future. These advances can assist the design of future large-scale sustainability-related assessment processes, aiming to better support decisions and interventions for equitable and sustainable futures.

AB  - The nature of electronically excited states in DNA is analyzed in detail using a combination of quantum mechanical (QM) semiempirical calculations and molecular dynamics (MD). For this purpose, we consider homogeneous pi stacks extracted from the MD trajectory of a poly(A)center dot poly(T) oligomer. The environment is accounted for within the QM/MM scheme. The effects of structural fluctuations on exciton delocalization and photoinduced charge separation are explored using the quantitative analysis of the electron density in the excited states. We distinguish the effects generated by the vibronic interactions within nucleobases and by the environment of the p stack. While in ideal B-DNA stacks (A-T)(n) singlet excited states are spread over all intrastrand nucleobases, the average exciton length is similar to 0.75n, thermal fluctuations decrease considerably the extent of delocalization. The QM/MD model predicts that the excitons in (A-T)(n) stacks are spread over 3 bases (for n = 4 and 6, the average exciton length is found to be 2.6 +/- 0.3 and 2.8 +/- 0.3, respectively). We show that the main factor reducing the exciton length is the vibronic interactions within nucleobases whereas fluctuations of the pi stack environment play a relatively minor role. The oscillator strength of electronic transitions from the ground state to charge-separated states A(k)(+)A(k +/- 1)(-) and Tk+Tk +/- 1- is found to be strong enough to populate directly these states by UV absorption at E = 5.0-5.3 eV. In contrast, the direct formation of interstrand charge transfer states A(i)(+)T(j)(-) is predicted to be unlikely.

AB  - Campeche Bank located in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico is characterized by particular oceanographic and physiographic conditions that promote great biodiversity, including abundant fishery resources. Systematic sampling through oceanographic campaigns (November 2015, April 2016), produced high-quality data to generate a trophic model balance using Ecopath software. The goal of this study is to know the baseline of the structure and functioning of this important marine area. The predator/prey matrix was drawn up from the stomach content analysis of 186 fish species integrated into 47 families. The schematic representation exemplifies a complex trophic interaction of 22 trophic groups, including 10 fish groups, 8 invertebrate, zooplankton, phytoplankton, benthic producers, and detritus. Production and consumption of biomass and ecotrophic efficiency values were calculated for each of the trophic groups. The Total System Throughput was of 319.514 t/km(2)/year. The Ascendency, system Overhead, and Development Capacity were of 476.4, 673.1, and 1150.0 flow bits, respectively. Campeche Bank is an oligotrophic system with an intermediate state of resilience to environmental variations, growth potential intermediate, and greatly influenced by loop and Caribbean currents. These properties together with indicators of overfishing in the system and pollution (hydrocarbons), highlight the requirement of controlling fishery pressures and monitor hydrocarbons industry in the area to maintain its function and biodiversity.

AB  - The article is devoted to studying the relationship between environmental taxes and the innovative development of the oil and gas industry. The bibliometric analysis of the directions of scientific research of the chain "innovative management - oil and gas industry - environmental taxes" testified to the central place of the issue of sustainable development in ensuring innovative transformations of the industry. It is determined that at the present stage, the application of environmental taxes aims not only to reduce environmental pollution but also to ensure structural transformations of the economy on the way to ensuring its sustainable development. It has been proven that innovations in the oil and gas industry are connected with implementing more efficient technologies and the search for prospects for its transformation under the green economy goals. It is determined that the application of environmental taxes to stimulate sustainable development progress requires the complexity of their application with other instruments of state support for environmental innovation. An empirical analysis of the relationship between environmental taxation and oil and gas production and consumption using statistics for OECD countries for 2010-2019. Correlation analysis results identified the inverse relationship between the dynamics of indicators of environmental tax intensity and the parameters of the oil and gas industry. Regression with Newey-West standard errors dependences of changes in oil and gas production and consumption under the influence of changes in environmental tax revenues confirmed the existence of an inverse relationship. It is determined that with the growth of tax revenues from environmental taxes, there are significant reductions in both production and consumption of oil and gas. Accordingly, it is confirmed that environmental taxes are one of the reasons for the innovative transformations of the oil and gas industry, associated with reducing its traditional operation and the transition to more advanced technologies for energy production. The obtained results create a basis for adjusting the state strategies for regulating the functioning of the oil and gas industry and ensuring its innovative development.

AB  - In 1970-2000, the state of the natural environment in many regions of Poland was unsatisfactory. This situation has been improving since the integration with the European Union, mainly owing to the reduction of emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The present study included three tree species: rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L. em. Hedl.), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill.), and aspen (Populus tremula L.). The trees grew in a pollution free environment (Huszlew) and in an urban agglomeration (Lublin). The aim of this research was to make comparative observations of the structure of leaves in relation to the content of lead, zinc, copper, nitrogen and sulphur determined in these organs. The N/S ratio in the leaves was accepted as an indicator of proper metabolic processes. Observations of leaves were made with using light microscopy and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The content of heavy metals in leaves was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) after dry mineralization. Total sulphur was determined by the turbidimetric method, while nitrogen by the Kjeldahl method after mineralization in sulphuric acid. When influenced by polluted air, the epidermis of the examined leaves was composed of smaller cells with higher stomatal density per unit area and had a lower number of open pores compared to the epidermis of the leaves developed in a clean environment. Among the species investigated, aspen was characterized by the highest ability to bioaccumulate heavy metals in its leaves. Among the elements determined only the Zn content exceeded the permissible limit, whereas Pb and Cu were found to occur in the range of values considered to be optimal. The dominant share of lead in suspended dust caused changes in the epidermis of leaves, which led to disorders in plant water relations.

AB  - Globally, parasites are sensitive toward environmental changes, and, in some cases, they are even more sensitive than their hosts. However, there is limited knowledge on the physiological responses of parasites and their effects on their hosts in relation to environmental degradation. In this study, metallothioneins (MTs) were isolated and compared between the ectoparasite Lamproglena clariae and its host fish Clarias gariepinus. Differences in the levels of MTs in the parasite and host were compared to physicochemical water quality variables and metals to determine if MT expression was linked with changes in water quality. Clarias gariepinus individuals were sampled from 2 sites of differing water quality along the Vaal River using gill nets and assessed for L. clariae. Gill, muscle, and liver tissue of the host and L. clariae were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen for analysis of MT. Water and sediment samples were collected for metal analysis by inductively coupled plasma- optical emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Nutrient levels and water hardness in water samples were assessed using spectrophotometry. MTs were quantified using spectrophotometry and size exclusion chromatography in the host and parasite, respectively. Infections by L. clariae differed between sites, with higher parasite intensity at the unpolluted Vaal Dam site. Concentrations of MT in host tissues and L. clariae were significantly higher at the polluted site, below the Vaal River Barrage, compared to the Vaal Dam site. Parasite MT concentrations were significantly lower compared to concentrations in the liver and gill tissue of C. gariepinus individuals. In conclusion, differences in the concentrations of MT and infection biology of L. clariae reflected the state of the environment and support the usefulness of this parasite and other Lamproglena spp. as bioindicators.

AB  - Southeast Asia has undergone rapid developments in terms of urbanization, economic and population growth. The progress in sewerage treatment infrastructure has not kept pace with such developments. The inadequacy and inefficiency of sewerage systems has prompted the release of untreated sewage into the aquatic environment of Southeast Asia causing many waterborne illnesses since surface water is utilized for recreational, agricultural and aquaculture purposes and, above all, as a source of water intake in Southeast Asia. This paper will review the current data on molecular markers of sewage pollution including sterols and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) in Southeast Asian aquatic environment to clarify the state of sewage pollution and the competence of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in this area. Despite the importance of sewage pollution research in the region, the number of studies using molecular markers to trace the sources of sewage pollution is limited. So far, indicators of sewage pollution have been investigated in aquatic environments of Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia and Brunei among Southeast Asian countries. The concentrations and diagnostic ratios of faecal sterols and LABs show the release of untreated and primary treated urban waste into water bodies of these countries. Further studies are required to fill the data gaps in Southeast Asia and come to a better understanding of the trends of sewage pollution in this part of the world.

AB  - Green products, clean energy, energy union, green buildings, eco-innovations, environment-related, and similar initiatives and policies have become very popular and widely applied all over the world. A pleasant built environment (parks, flowerbeds, beautiful buildings) and a repulsive environment (noise, polluted surroundings) influence a buyer's outlook on an advertisement differently. An aesthetic, comfortable, and clean built environment evokes positive emotional states, not only at the time of housing selection and purchase but during the building's life cycle as well. Potential housing buyers always feel comfortable in certain built environments, and they are inclined to spend more time there. The issues needing answers are how to measure the segmentation/physiological indicators (crowd composition by gender and age groups), as well as the emotional (happy, sad, angry, valence) and physiological (heart rate) states of potential homebuyers realistically, to produce an integrated evaluation of such data and offer buyers rational, green, and energy efficient housing alternatives. To achieve this purpose, the Multisensory, green and energy efficient housing neuromarketing method was developed to generate the necessary conditions. Here, around 200 million multisensory data recordings (emotional and physiological states) were accumulated, and the environmental air pollution (CO, NO2, PM10, volatile organic compounds) and noise pollution were investigated. Specific green and energy efficient building case studies appear in this article to demonstrate the developed method clearly. The obtained research results are in line with those from previous and current studies, which state that the interrelation of environmental responsiveness and age forms an inverse U and that an interest in green and energy efficient housing depends on age.

AB  - Background: Agroforestry systems can improve the provision of ecosystem services at the farm scale whilst improving agricultural productivity, thereby playing an important role in the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Natural capital accounting offers a framework for demonstrating the capacity of agroforestry systems to deliver sustained private benefits to farming enterprises, but traditionally is applied at larger scales than those at which farmers make decisions. Methods: Here we review the current state of knowledge on natural capital accounting and analyse how such an approach may be effectively applied to demonstrate the farm-scale value of agroforestry assets. We also discuss the merits of applying a natural capital approach to agroforestry decision-making and present an example of a conceptual model for valuation of agroforestry assets at the farm scale. Results: Our findings suggest that with further development of conceptual models to support existing tools and frameworks, a natural capital approach could be usefully applied to improve decision-making in agroforestry at the farm scale. Using this approach to demonstrate the private benefits of agroforestry systems could also encourage adoption of agroforestry, increasing public benefits such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. However, to apply this approach, improvements must be made in our ability to predict the types and amounts of services that agroforestry assets of varying condition provide at the farm or paddock scale.

AB  - Assisting the natural recovery of coral reefs through local management actions is needed in response to increasing ecosystem disturbances in the Anthropocene. There is growing evidence that commonly used resilience-based passive management approaches may not be sufficient to maintain coral reef key functions. We synthesize and discuss advances in coral reef recovery research, and its application to coral reef conservation and restoration practices. We then present a framework to guide the decision-making of reef managers, scientists and other stakeholders, to best support reef recovery after a disturbance. The overall aim of this management framework is to catalyse reef recovery, to minimize recovery times, and to limit the need for ongoing management interventions into the future. Our framework includes two main stages: first, a prioritization method for assessment following a large-scale disturbance, which is based on a reef's social-ecological values, and on a classification of the likelihood of recovery or succession resulting in degraded, novel, hybrid or historical states. Second, a flow chart to assist with determining management actions for highly valued reefs. Potential actions are chosen based on the ecological attributes of the disturbed reef, defined during ecological assessments. Depending on the context, management actions may include (1) substrata rehabilitation actions to facilitate natural coral recruitment, (2) repopulating actions using active restoration techniques, (3) resilience-based management actions and (4) monitoring coral recruitment and growth to assess the effectiveness of management interventions. We illustrate the proposed decision framework with a case study of typhoon-damaged eastern outer reefs in Palau, Micronesia. The decisions made following this framework lead to the conclusion that some reefs may not return to their historical state for many decades. However, if motivation and funds are available, new management approaches can be explored to assist coral reefs at valued locations to return to a functional state providing key ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper presents a preliminary attempt to estimate the awareness and value that society gives to the maintenance and protection of marine protected areas, linking the ecological and economic value scale assigned to the study. To accomplish this, we took as illustrative example the Biophysical Interest Zone of Avencas (ZIBA), in Portugal. The ZIBA spans over one ha and its coastal ecosystems present a very rich biodiversity, providing several socio-economic opportunities to society. To estimate the value that society attributes to this area we conducted a contingent valuation exercise, considering two different aspects: 1) the direct economic value that people state to conserve the ecosystem and 2) the willingness to contribute through the allocation of hours of voluntary work to its conservation. The values obtained indicate the dependence and importance of this ecosystem to local population (willing to pay to conserve it of 60 E per household per year and willing to give 3 h of voluntary work per year). The proximity of the local population to the protected area increases the willing to pay for its conservation; this could reveal a good local indicator of ecosystem valuation. This valuation exercise highlights the importance of coastal ecosystem services to society and draws attention to the benefits that local populations derive from those systems. These results have also implications in future governance actions regarding protected areas, as well as to justify for sustainable investments in coastal management efforts, to sustain the flow of coastal ecosystem services for current and future generations.

AB  - We studied photophysical changes of pyranine in different surfactant environments using spectrophotometry, steady-state fluorescence, and time-resolved fluorescence lifetime. The effect of surfactants on such properties varied as a function of the surfactant charge. Whereas anionic surfactants did not show any kind of interaction, the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 produced spectral changes in the dye, as a consequence of the shift of equilibrium between its excited species. In the case of fluorescence, these changes allowed the critical micellar concentration of the surfactant to be determined. However, the most important features were obtained from the interaction with cationic surfactants of the n-alkyl trimethylammonium bromides. Such interactions enabled the formation of premicellar aggregates to be determined. In addition, three or four critical concentrations could be defined, which were dependent on the length of the hydrocarbon chain. One of these was the critical micellar concentration of the surfactant. The remaining two or three were in the very dilute concentration domain from which several types of premicellar aggregates are formed. However, the interaction with dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide at submicellar concentrations evidenced a quenching effect of a different nature (either static or combined), depending on the surfactant concentration. By deconvoluting the overall pyranine fluorescence emission spectrum into a sum of overlapping Lorentzian-Gaussian functions, the principal microenvironments of the pyranine molecules can be ascertained. Fluorescence data are consistent with the location of pyranine in a variety of sites, including partitioning that may be influenced by electrostatic and pi-cation interactions in aqueous micelles.

AB  - This article examines the current state and drivers of environmental transparency in the Russian Mining and Metals sector. The study is based upon 2016-19 successive annual rankings calculated transparently, using publicly available information and a third-party-verified ranking system. Ranking results reveal a definite increase in the transparency level of one of the most closed industries in Russia. The findings from the study show that a company's presence in the stock markets has a positive impact on its openness in environmental matters. However, a company's listing on an international stock exchange does not guarantee high environmental transparency. Some evidence of a correlation between ranking positions and participation of diversified financial-industrial groups in the share capital was also found. Overall, our analyses suggest that ESG (environmental, social and governance) management in the Russian mining and metals sector is only in the process of development. To overcome this, the environmental transparency ranking of mining and metals companies in Russia creates a new mechanism for raising public awareness and dialogue between the public and one of the most closed industries. The ranking initiated calculation of industry-average quantitative impact indicators that, as the sample grows, will transform into an important benchmark for corporate self-assessment when comparing Russian practices with those of the largest international and foreign mining and metal companies across the globe.

AB  - Salamanders are important members of faunal communities in Appalachian Mountain (USA) streams, and the use of salamanders as bioindicators is increasing. Roads are a part of the modern landscape, but effects of roads on stream and streamside salamander diversity and abundance is not clear. We sampled streams in central West Virginia, USA, using quadrats placed along transects in the flowing channel, dry channel, and stream bank to assess salamander diversity, richness, and abundance during 2004. We used Akaike's Information Criterion for model selection at reach (i.e., above and below culverts) and stream scales. Salamander diversity and richness was affected by elevation, stream gradient, canopy cover, and the presence of roads. Overall, stream and riparian habitat quality was the most important factor affecting salamander richness. The presence of roads, stream gradient, and elevation received the most empirical support for predicting species' abundances. Roads benefited disturbance-tolerant species but negatively affected other species. Impacts of roads and culverts on habitat should be considered by federal and state transportation agencies and natural resources agencies during the planning process and addressed through mitigation efforts. Managers should install culverts that are as wide as the stream channel, at grade with the streambed, and dominated by rubble substrate to provide maximum benefit for salamanders.

AB  - Over the past decade, Europe's Water Framework Directive (WFD) has prompted a large amount of ecological research aiming at establishing river typologies and ecological indicators in member States. Yet, the lack of robust bioindicators in Europe's overseas regions arguably reflects minimal knowledge of the distribution patterns of aquatic species in the Community's outermost areas. Specifically, there has been no published classification of rivers for any European overseas region. Fifty-one sites were sampled for benthic invertebrates and environmental variables (land-cover, physical habitat, and water chemistry) in Guadeloupe, French Lesser Antilles. Redundancy analysis and k-means clustering were used to bring out spatial patterns in species composition in relation to environmental conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of land cover and geomorphology in delineating three ecological sub-regions (clusters) for freshwater invertebrates. Deviation from predictable community structure only occurred when river sites were subjected to harsh water chemistry alterations (urban runoff, wastewaters). Changes in species richness did not detect environmental stress efficiently within a given sub-region, probably because most sites are naturally species-poor due to the insular context and/or because disturbance is often weak. However, differences existed between clusters in terms of species identity and numerical dominance. Our a posteriori typology of sites was compared to local a priori expert opinion of river health, in an attempt to better characterize the network of survey sites, and to target sites for reference conditions.

AB  - We examined the evolution of delta(13)C and delta(15)N of sedimenting particulate organic matter (SPOM) in response to changes in primary productivity, nutrient loading, and plankton dynamics in Lake Lugano between 1985 and 1998. A decreasing delta(13)C reflects the decline of phosphorus loading in Lake Lugano, suggesting that the delta(13)C of SPOM is a good indicator of P availability in the lake, with phosphate being the major control on the CO2 draw-down in the photic zone. However, annual primary production and VC do not correlate. The expansion of the trophogenic layer in response to lowered plankton biomass concentrations balanced the effect of reduced phosphate concentration on total primary production (per unit area) and, thus, biased the correlation of delta(13)C and primary productivity. Whereas a substantial decrease of total phytoplankton biomass in the late 1980s clearly affected the delta(13)C of SPOM, it did not seem to affect delta(15)N. Marked changes in the plankton population composition did not have a major effect on delta(15)N. If at all, the effects of primary productivity, nitrate utilization, and changes in the intensity of denitrification are superimposed on a signal dominantly derived from changes in the amount and isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from external sources. A marked positive shift (+3parts per thousand) in the delta(15)N observed in 1994/1995 corresponded to the introduction of a denitrification stage in wastewater treatment. This study demonstrates that the delta(13)C of exported organic matter is a useful indicator of the trophic state of lacustrine environments. The delta(15)N of sedimentary organic matter is unlikely to reflect nitrate utilization or denitrification if the input of external N sources dominates the N-isotope dynamics within the lake. However, in those systems, organic matter delta(15)N can provide information on the development of N pollution and subsequent effects of lake restoration measures.

AB  - After decades of declining cropland area, the United States (US) experienced a reversal in land use/land cover change in recent years, with substantial grassland conversion to cropland in the US Midwest. Although previous studies estimated soil carbon (C) loss due to cropland expansion, other important environmental indicators, such as soil erosion and nutrient loss, remain largely unquantified. Here, we simulated the environmental impacts from the conversion of grassland to corn and soybeans for 12 US Midwestern states using the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model. Between 2008 and 2016, over 2 Mha of grassland were converted to crop production in these states, with much less cropland concomitantly abandoned or retired from production. The net grassland-cropland conversion increased annual soil erosion by 7.9%, nitrogen (N) loss by 3.7%, and soil organic carbon loss by 5.6% relative to that of existing cropland, despite an associated increase in cropland area of only 2.5%. Notably, the above estimates represent the scenario of converting unmanaged grassland to tilled corn and soybeans, and impacts varied depending upon crop type and tillage regime. Corn and soybeans are dominant biofuel feedstocks, yet the grassland conversion and subsequent environmental impacts simulated in this study are likely not attributable solely to biofuel-driven land use change since other factors also contribute to corn and soybean prices and land use decisions. Nevertheless, our results suggest grassland conversion in the Upper Midwest has resulted in substantial degradation of soil quality, with implications for air and water quality as well. Additional conservation measures are likely necessary to counterbalance the impacts, particularly in areas with high rates of grassland conversion (e.g. the Dakotas, southern Iowa).

AB  - Restoration of a self-sustaining lake trout population in Lake Ontario is a goal of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR), which manage Lake Ontario fisheries. That goal was questioned during public consultation activities conducted by both agencies to evaluate potential management responses to an imbalance between the demand of salmonine predators and the supply of prey species. Participants were mostly traditional fishery clients who are principally concerned with the availability of fish as ecosystem products. Many recreational and commercial fishermen on Lake Ontario view the goal of lake trout restoration negatively because they perceive it as a threat to their pursuit of preferred fish species. Support of lake trout restoration by environmentally oriented individuals may be constrained because this involves stocking fish into a chemically contaminated environment, a practice that has raised concerns about human health implications among environmental groups. Lake trout restoration has taken on increasing ecological significance because self-sustaining lake trout populations are considered indicators of ecosystem health or integrity in Lake Ontario and other Great Lakes. The lake trout restoration issue is a metaphor for the larger issue of whether natural resource management should be directed principally toward human uses of ecosystem products or the restoration of ecological structure and function. The concurrent trends toward ecosystem management and an increasing public role in government decision-making may be in conflict, which has created a dilemma for Lake Ontario fisheries managers. No procedures exist to guide fisheries managers in the resolution of issues defined by competing values. As a general guideline for decision-making, we agree that fisheries managers should be advocates of longterm well-being and availability of fisheries resources for human benefit. Expansion of the temporal scale of fishery management plans will require greater attention to ecological structure and function. Public participation will continue to grow in importance, but must be carefully designed and conducted to be effective. Impediments to lake trout restoration are not limited to the biophysical dimensions of Great Lakes ecosystems, but also include sociocultural issues.

AB  - Degraded red spruce (Picea rubens)-northern hardwood ecosystems are the focus of restoration efforts across high-elevation landscapes in the Central Appalachian region of the eastern United States. To promote ecosystem function and long-term sustainability of restored forests, it is important to understand the associated biota, including bird communities. Certain bird species could serve as ecological indicators, with potential applications for evaluating restoration efforts. However, contemporary and statistically rigorous studies of red spruce bird communities in this region are lacking, as is a formal analysis of indicator species. The purpose of this study was to use multivariate regression trees and indicator species analyses to determine if bird communities and individual bird species, respectively, are strongly associated with the red spruce-northern hardwood ecosystem in Central Appalachia. Specifically, we assessed those associations with three distinct but complementary sets of forest characteristics, focusing on (1) red spruce and northern hardwood forest types, (2) classes of percent red spruce cover, and (3) red spruce and northern hardwood stand size classes. Community-wide avian point count survey data were collected in mid-May to mid-July 2010-2019 at 645 sampling points located in forest stands throughout the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia. We found that red spruce and northern hardwood forest types had distinct bird communities within the study area, and that community composition differed among red spruce cover classes. In addition, forest type was more influential on bird community composition than stand size class (poletimber or sawtimber). Eleven indicator species were consistently associated with red spruce forests, whereas fewer species were identified as indicator species for northern hardwood forests. Ultimately, the distinctiveness of the bird community in red spruce forests and strength of those associations highlight the critical need for and importance of restoration efforts targeting red spruce-northern hardwood ecosystems in the Central Appalachians to ensure long-term maintenance of regional avian diversity.

AB  - In recent decades, international assessments of the ocean have evolved from specialized, technical evaluations of the state of the marine environment to more integrated and thematically extensive science-policy platforms. As assessment programmes such as the UN Regular Process blossom on the global stage and subsume responsibility for tracking progress on sustainable development, there is a need to consider how their processes wield influence and effectively translate knowledge into action. In the present paper, we undertake a comprehensive review of the literature on global environmental assessments (GEAs) and extract key principles that can be applied to global assessments of the marine environment. We were particularly inspired to identify how social processes could be arranged to best distill, communicate, and produce actionable knowledge. While we look to the advice of experts in the literature, we highlight specific examples from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and the Global Environment Outlook (GEO). From this review, knowledge coproduction, multilevel collaboration, and futures thinking emerged as the dominant principles of influential and action-oriented assessments. We conclude the paper by contextualizing how these principles may be operationalized for Global Marine Assessments in the future.

TI  - PALEOECOLOGICAL INSIGHTS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS IN DRYLAND ENVIRONMENTS - A CASE-STUDY OF THE VERLORENVLEI SYSTEM, SOUTH-AFRICA
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
LA  - English
AB  - 1.  Verlorenvlei, a dryland aquatic ecosystem in South Africa, has been identified as having enormous conservation importance.  Although the system has Ramsar status and is widely regarded as being in 'pristine' condition, neither statutory control nor any form of management is currently in existence.
   2.  Based on the analysis of fossil pollen derived from the sediments of Verlorenvlei, a sequence of rapid changes within the riparian and aquatic vegetation is identified.  Synchronous changes in the rate of sedimentation suggest a threefold increase in annual sediment deposition since the mid-18th century-the onset of colonial settlement.
   3.  The pollen spectra prior to the arrival of colonial settlers suggest that abundant Poaceae (grasses) and rooted aquatic plants dominated the vegetation of the site.  Radical changes in the pollen record become evident after the time of European colonization.  Aquatic vegetation, including Gentianaceae (water lilies) and Potamogetonaceae, show a marked decrease while riparian vegetation, particularly reed elements such as Cyperaceae, Typhaceae and Juncaceae, are seen to increase progressively.  Terrestrial pollen indicators reveal an expansion in the vegetation of classic disturbance indicators such as Asteraceae, Oxalidaceae and Scrophulariaceae.
   4.  As the wetland has already endured rapid ecological adjustments in the face of colonial (and more recent) occupation of the broader landscape, it cannot be regarded as being in a 'pristine' state.  Indeed, Verlorenvlei is interpreted as having reached a state of 'transitional' ecological equilibrium in which it continues to endure a number of rapid ecological changes; nonetheless, it is still worthy of conservation and management, not least because of its role as a strategic wetland in a dryland environment.
   5.  Failing the timely implementation of remedial action in the form of an integrated conservation and management plan, Verlorenvlei appears destined to become irreversibly altered.
   6.  Dryland aquatic ecosystems are vital aquatic resources in so called 'Third World' regions of the world yet, paradoxically, scientific research on, and the conservation of, these environments in the Southern Hemisphere are rare by comparison to wetland environments in the northern temperate zones.  Although many dryland aquatic systems may already be altered, most are worthy of urgent management and conservation action, bearing in mind the fundamental question:  'What is it that we wish to conserve?'.
   7.  A number of recommendations for the management of dryland aquatic ecosystems such as Verlorenvlei are listed.

AB  - Seabirds are Frequently used as indicators of the state of the marine environment. The kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) is a common and widespread surface-feeding seabird often used for such a purpose. Data were collected on the food of chicks, breeding success, and chick neglect at a colony in south-east Scotland every summer in the period 1986-1996. Breeding success declined significantly over the period and breeding became later. In one year, many adults failed to breed. A similar decline in breeding success was also recorded at colonies over a 250-300 km section of coast in south-east Scotland and north-east England. Sandeels (Ammodytes marinus), especially 0-group fish (young of the year), made up the bulk of the diet in all years; herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus), waste from trawlers, and planktonic Crustacea was of lesser importance. Nesting success increased significantly with the proportion of 0-group sandeels in the diet of chicks and with the average energy value of 0-group sandeels, variables which were significantly and positively correlated. Clupeids and trawler waste were probably taken only when sandeels were unavailable. Brood neglect was not a good indicator of annual total breeding success. The decline in nesting success appeared to commence before the development of a large local industrial fishery for sandeels. (C) 1997 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB  - The environmental safety of the cationic surfactant, ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride (DTDMAC), has been determined from usage rates and fate data from The Netherlands and standard, well accepted assessment techniques.  An environmental concentration model was developed using DTDMAC tonnages for 1990, actual per capita waste flow, and measured removal rates in wastewater treatment plants.  This model incorporated a state of the art dilution model, instream removal and background DTDMAC concentrations.  Based on this model, the 90th percentile river concentration of DTDMAC below wastewater treatment plant outfalls was estiamted as 0.021 mg/L (i.e., 90% of Dutch surface waters receiving wastewater effluents have environmental concentrations less than 0.021 mg/L).  This estimated concentration agrees well with the maximum measured DTDMAC concentrations in Dutch surface waters.  Toxicity values for the risk assessment were derived from a study which used an environmentally relevant dosing system (i.e., effluent from an activated sludge treatment system) to measure commercial DTDMAC toxicity.  Based on chronic toxicity data for Ceriodaphnia dubia and Selenastrum capricornutum from this study, a no effect level of 4.53 mg/L was determined for use in the risk assessment.  Thus, the DTDMAC safety factor for aquatic organisms is 215 (4.53/0.021).  It is concluded that DTDMAC poses a low risk to aquatic life based on testing of sensitive species and environmental concentrations predicted by state-of-the-art assessment methods.

AB  - Global threats to soils remain one of the greatest concerns and challenges of the 21st century. Built landscapes have profound local and global effects because they create urban heat islands, increase habitat fragmentation, and reduce biological diversity. Additionally, impervious surfaces alter natural watersheds and reduce infiltration increasing runoff that leads to erosion and soil degradation. To combat these effects, green infrastructure (GI) practices, like water harvesting rain gardens, are implemented in the Southwest United States to restore natural ecological function, yet little is known about how GI impacts soil health. Soil health can be measured using indicators that include physical, chemical, and biological characteristics that support ecosystem processes. This study aimed to evaluate changes in water holding capacity, bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity, Gibbs free energy, species richness and Shannon diversity in response to rain gardens that received different inputs (frequency and amount) and sources of harvested water (rain, municipal, greywater) one year after installation. We hypothesized that soil health indicators in GI diverge from the unaltered control treatment one year following installation. Although physical and chemical indicators were comparatively less sensitive to GI treatments than biological indicators, they varied within treatments after one year of GI management (pH increased: H = 36.37; p-value = 0.00; electrical conductivity decreased: H = 33.94; p-value = 0.00). Overall, we observed significantly higher soil microbial diversity (F = 4.29; p-value = 0.015) and richness (F = 4.02; p-value = 0.019) in surface soils in GI treatments after one year of management. Our findings suggest GI practices enhanced soil biological health which may lead to positive feedbacks that assist gradual changes in the abiotic environment thus enhancing soil health over time. These findings have broad implications for effectively assessing the success of GI management practices over short time periods using soil biological health indicators. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current article focuses on the possibilities of applying bumblebees as one of the biodiversity indicators in the monitoring and evaluation of the Estonian Agri-Environmental Programme (AEP) at landscape level. The need for agri-environmental indicators arises, at least partially, because the desired state of the environment sought by policy makers may not be directly observable. To develop agri-environmental measures favourable to landscape quality, it is necessary to know more about the relationship between landscape structure and composition and the number of different species. This study tested the relationship between the data sets of landscape elements and bumblebee communities from 11 agricultural areas in Estonia. The localities were divided into two groups: intensively used agricultural areas (IA) (the percentage of arable land was >65%) and less intensively used agricultural areas (LIA) (the percentage of arable land was <45%). The following elements of landscape structure were analysed: buffer zones narrower than 5 m and wider than 5 m, ecotones between cultivated land and broad-leaved forests, ecotones between cultivated land and mixed or coniferous forests, ditches and brooks, fallow land, mixed forests, coniferous forests, broad-leaved forests, bushes, wetlands, cultivated grasslands, pastures, legumes, arable land, semi-natural grasslands. Fifteen bumblebee species were recorded in LIA and 13 in IA. The most widely distributed and abundant species were Bombus lucorum, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius. These species dominated in both types of agricultural area. Two species, Bombus jonellus and Bombus hypnorum were found only in LIA. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the landscape elements and the bumblebee species found. Results showed that there was a significant co-structure between the data sets of landscape elements and bumblebee communities. The most important landscape features that correlated with the distribution of the bumblebee species were the ecotone length between cultivated land and forests, and the size of the area covered with mixed forests and wetlands.

AB  - This strategy paper presents a concept how to assess the ecological quality of running waters in the Federal Republic of Germany. The main cause for this paper is the original draft of an ecological guideline of the European Union (EU) which is going to become a part of a general frame guideline of the EU for waters. This guideline will ask of the European states a valuation of ecological quality of waters which is based on the undisturbed situation of the different aquatic ecosystems. The main basis for an ecological assessment is the classification of running waters in the Federal Republic of Germany according to their most important morphological and hydrological characteristics on one hand and a biocenotic description of these morphological/hydrological river types on the other hand. This method orientates itself by the natural type-specific reference status (leitbild) of streams and rivers. The main characteristics of running waters and their leitbilds may be combined in the major complexes biology morphology/hydrology, and chemistry. Each of these complexes can be investigated and assessed separately in a first step. In a following step, the single results may be summarized in an overall score of ecological quality. In this open assessment system (regarding the number of parameters) we propose 4 previous classes of ecological quality which may be extended later - if necessary - to 7 classes or more. Two variations of assessment are proposed. Variation 1 is thought for small to medium-sized streams and rivers. The assessment will be necessary in an extensive blanket coverage manner, and it should be done mainly biologically. Variation 2 will consider larger rivers with predominant chemical parameters because these are investigated in nearly ail these waters regularly and intensively.

AB  - Birds are among the most important organisms for indicating the state of environmental health and their population changes may be thus informative for assessments of country-level conservation tools. One such tool applied in the European Union (EU) is the Birds Directive which (together with general protection of all bird species) lists a number of species under its Annex I and these species enjoy specific protection conditions. Although some previous studies found indications of the efficiency of the Annex I in delivering benefits for the listed species, the assessments where either confined to the so called old member states (i.e. countries entered EU before 2004) or did not include countries outside EU as a suitable control group. Therefore, it remains unclear whether this tool is efficient also in the new EU-member states (i.e. countries entered EU from 2004 onwards). For this purpose, we used publicly available information source and assembled a dataset providing country-level population trends of 252 European breeding bird species estimated for the time period 2001-2012 in 33 European countries containing old member states, new member states and non-member states. We predicted that if efficient, then listing the species under Annex I would result in significantly positive population trends of the listed species in EU countries irrespective to the time of their enterance, while no such pattern should be observed in non-EU countries. We tested this prediction using linear mixed effect models controlling for the effects of 11 species' traits reflecting the influence of other factors (e.g. climate change, land cover change, proximity to range edges) on trends and including the species and country indentifiers as random effects. We found that the listing under the Annex I had significantly positive effect on bird trends in both old and new member states, whereas no such effect was observed in the non-member states. Although the positive influence of listing was larger in the old and than in the new member states, the difference was not statistically significant. Our results imply that the Annex I of the Birds Directive is an important tool for bird conservation in Europe and that its positive influence on bird populations is detectable even in the new EU members entering EU relatively recently. As birds are often used as indicators also for other groups of organisms, these results suggest that not only birds may benefit from EU's conservation legislation but comprehensive assessments are needed.

AB  - To prevent further global declines in biodiversity, identifying and understanding key habitats is crucial for successful conservation strategies. For example, globally, seabird populations are under threat and animal movement data can identify key at-sea areas and provide valuable information on the state of marine ecosystems. To date, in order to locate these areas, studies have used global positioning system (GPS) to record position and are sometimes combined with time-depth recorder (TDR) devices to identify diving activity associated with foraging, a crucial aspect of at-sea behaviour. However, the use of additional devices such as TDRs can be expensive, logistically difficult and may adversely affect the animal. Alternatively, behaviours may be resolved from measurements derived from the movement data alone. However, this behavioural analysis frequently lacks validation data for locations predicted as foraging (or other behaviours). Here, we address these issues using a combined GPS and TDR dataset from 108 individuals by training deep learning models to predict diving in European shags, common guillemots and razorbills. We validate our predictions using withheld data, producing quantitative assessment of predictive accuracy. The variables used to train these models are those recorded solely by the GPS device: variation in longitude and latitude, altitude and coverage ratio (proportion of possible fixes acquired within a set window of time). Different combinations of these variables were used to explore the qualities of different models, with the optimum models for all species predicting non-diving and diving behaviour correctly over 94% and 80% of the time, respectively. We also demonstrate the superior predictive ability of these supervised deep learning models over other commonly used behavioural prediction methods such as hidden Markov models. Mapping these predictions provides useful insights into the foraging activity of a range of seabird species, highlighting important at sea locations. These models have the potential to be used to analyse historic GPS datasets and further our understanding of how environmental changes have affected these seabirds over time.

AB  - This study has been carried out with the aim of mapping karst and evaluation of degree of karstification of carbonate rocks in Iran. Mapping of karstic regions of Iran has been performed by some authors previously, but scale and limited information availability have limited the accuracy of their works. In addition, rock type was considered as the main factor to make a karstification map, and other important factors such as tectonic and climate conditions were ignored. One objective of this paper is a spatial evaluation of karst development in Iran considering the role of the chief factors affecting karst development. In this study, a theoretical karst map was developed on the basis of what is considered to be a proper combination of these factors. The main considered factors are those classified by White (Geomorphology and Hydrology of Karst Terrains, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1988) into three driving forces (i.e., chemical driving force, physical driving force and hydrogeological setting). Precipitation, temperature, relief, rock type, tectonic setting and stratigraphic thickness of soluble carbonate rocks are the main factors classified to describe the mentioned driving forces. In this study, precipitation and temperature are represented by the chemical weathering conditions during the modern and glacial periods prepared on the basis of Peltier's graphs. The required data were gathered from the updated maps with proper scale and detailed references. Then the data were mapped, classified, weighted and managed in separate layers in GIS environment. The karst index (K (i) ) is introduced to define the modeled degree of karstification computed by proper combination of six weighted layers, and the final theoretical karst map of Iran is prepared based on the ranked karst index. According to the combination method, values of K (i) could be in a range 0-400 in which higher values show more degree of karst development. The classified theoretical karst map shows that out of 205,589 km(2) of carbonate units (12.62 % of the surface area of Iran) about 78,253 km(2) (38.1 % of carbonate rocks) have very low to low degree of development of karstic features. About 98,145 km(2) (47.7 % of carbonate rocks) have moderate degree and about 29,192 km(2) (14.2 % of carbonate rocks) have high to very high degree of karstification. In other words, 7.81 % of Iran (62 % of the carbonate units) is underlain by carbonate rocks with moderate to high degree of karstification. Densities of caves and karstic springs are hydrogeological features used to check the calculated degree of karstification. For this purpose, complete inventories of caves and karstic springs in Iran were made. Out of 590 caves, 491 caves are located in carbonate rocks. From 1,074 karstic springs (with discharge above 10 l/s), 338 springs have discharges above 50 l/s; 146 caves and 330 springs (with discharges above 10 l/s) occur in rocks in areas of very low to low degree of karstification. About 243 caves and 430 springs fall in the moderate class and 102 caves and 314 springs in areas with high to very high degree of karstification. Cave densities (number of caves per area) are 0.0017, 0.0019, 0.0025, 0.0031 and 0.0046 caves per square kilometer for very low, low, moderate, high and very high classes, respectively. In addition, densities of springs are 0.0041, 0.0043, 0.0044, 0.0103 and 0.0122 springs per square kilometer for very low, low, moderate, high and very high classes, respectively.
   In other words, densities of caves and springs show a good correlation with the evaluated karstification. Final result is also checked by surface karstic landforms (such as karren and doline) on some examples of well-known karstic regions.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous chemicals that were used as additives in capacitors and transformers: and heavy contamination in the past of Midway Atoll, a national wildlife refuge, puts the wildlife, including the black-footed albatross (BFAL), at risk. In this study, we assess the profiles and toxicity of the individual PCB congeners at a natural equilibrium state in various tissues of 1-month old and 4-5-month old BFAL chicks and black-footed and Laysan albatross eggs found on the atoll. In the 1-month old chicks from Midway Atoll, the major seven congeners PCBs 99, 118, 138, 153, 170,180 and 183 accounted for 36-78% of the total PCBs in the various body parts, and the total PCB concentrations in the bird samples are inversely related to the total body weights. In the 4-5-month old chicks, these same congeners accounted for much lower percentages (7-26%) than in the 1-month-old chicks, with higher amounts of the less chlorinated congeners. The total toxic equivalents (TEQs) for all of the tissues in the 1-month old chicks ranged from 130 to 11,000 pg g(-1) (lipid weight, lw), and the total TEQs for the 4-5-month old chicks ranged from 18,000 to 100,000 pg g(-1). The average total concentration was 7.9 and 4.6 mu g g(-1) lw in the BFAL eggs and Laysan albatross eggs, respectively. The high concentrations could be accounted for by the age and PCB accumulation of the female producing the egg. The average TEQs were 70 and 90 pg g(-1) in the Laysan albatross eggs and BFAL eggs, respectively. This PCB concentration and toxicity information can be used to determine the toxicological risk of the BFAL chicks while nesting at Midway Atoll, and the analysis of the albatross eggs is an indication of the contamination of the female albatross at the time of egg formation, with the levels acting as an indicator of the total PCB body burdens that the females are experiencing. The information from this study is indicative of the toxicological risk to the seabirds that nest and feed near Midway and of the overall PCB contamination in the North Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Maintenance of overall ecosystem complexity is perceived as critical to the sustainability of ecosystem use. The development of an operational basis for an ecosystem approach to fisheries, however, faces many difficulties. On the research side, the challenge is in defining proper long-term, ecosystem-related objectives; determining meaningful reference values and indicators for desirable or undesirable states of the ecosystem; and developing appropriate data collection, analytical tools and models. The "viability" concept developed in economics by Jean-Pierre Aubin can be used to assist in the definition, selection of, and interaction among long-term objectives at an ecosystem level. It recognizes that ecosystems are complex assemblages of interacting and self-organizing natural and human components that cannot be predicted. Viability models define an ensemble of "viable states", in contrast to undesirable states defined as such by ecological, economic, and/or social constraints. These constraints can be derived from fisheries objectives, conservation principles, scientific results of modelling, or precautionary principles, and correspond to limit reference points to be avoided. Viability theory does not attempt to choose any "optimal solution" according to given criteria, but selects "viable evolutions". These evolutions are compatible with the constraints in the sense that they satisfy them at each time and can be delineated by the viability kernel. The southern Benguela marine ecosystem is presented as a first attempt for the application of this theory. In defining ecosystem-based objectives (and related issues such as target reference points), it seems more difficult to reach consensus among stakeholders on what is desirable than on what is undesirable (e.g. biological or economic collapse, species extinction, displacement of local rural communities). Expressed in the negative form or as limit reference points, ecosystem-based constraints can be considered simultaneously with current target reference points, such as maximum sustainable yield, using viability models. The viability approach can help to progressively integrate ecosystem considerations, such as conservation, into fisheries management. (c) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB  - The Australian Government has made a commitment to a National Land and Water Resources Audit (Audit) to provide data, analysis, and appraisal of natural resource management and to facilitate improved decision making at a range of scales. One of the themes within the Audit is ecosystem health. This article describes the goals of the Audit with respect to ecosystem health and provides examples of how these goals are being realized in terms of projects. Six projects within the ecosystem health theme of the Audit are described. Benefits of the ecosystem health paradigm have been recognized by the Audit in comparison to previous natural resource assessment methods that tended to focus on single components of ecosystems through the use of environmental quality indicators and often failed to make distinctions and linkages between ecosystem types. A "catchment to estuary" concept which identifies the linkages between landscape, catchment, waterway, and estuarine condition is providing the rationale behind the process-based integration of natural resource data sets which form the basis of methods being developed by the Audit. This depends upon the identification of key ecosystem process drivers and a range of attributes by which they may be measured at appropriate scales. The Audit's aim is to develop purpose-driven multiattribute assessment frameworks that can incorporate a range of available natural resource information along with social and economic data to provide a measure of distance of ecosystems from some desired state. The contributions of other Audit theme projects to such assessments and the final integrated reporting requirements of the Audit across disciplinary themes is described. Perceived benefits of the ecosystem health approach to natural resource assessment and tests of effectiveness that may be used by the Audit are also discussed.

AB  - Global warming and increasing human activity are altering northern ecosystems. In these strongly seasonal environments, small herbivorous mammals may have a significant role in determining the trajectory of ecosystem transitions from one state to another. Arctic ground squirrels Urocitellus parryii are a key component of northern terrestrial food webs and are considered ecosystem engineers, exerting a large impact on their habitat through bioturbation. We review and synthesize diverse information about current and past distribution and density of arctic ground squirrels, their physiology and ecological interactions with other species. Factors that appear to affect the distribution and abundance of arctic ground squirrels include increasing temperatures, changes in flooding probability, permafrost thaw, shifting phenology, habitat change, new predators and invasive diseases. Increases in the distribution and density of arctic ground squirrels in northern latitudes and high altitudes could accelerate ecosystem change through facilitation of disturbance-tolerant species, while decreases in southern and milder climates could remove an important agent of disturbance and prey item. Despite their pervasive ecological influence throughout most of their range, arctic ground squirrels are underrepresented in ecological research, based on a comparison of the number of publications about arctic ground squirrels with the number about other species of the same genus, and about other arctic herbivores. The widespread distribution of arctic ground squirrels, along with their potential to exacerbate and alter trajectories of ecosystem change under global warming, makes them a valuable indicator of ecosystem change and therefore a candidate for increased monitoring.

AB  - Ecological network analysis measures such as cycling index, indirect effects, and storage analysis provide insightful information on ecosystem organization and function, which can be extremely useful for environmental management and control. These system-wide measures focus on indirect relations among system compartments, providing a holistic approach. Unfortunately, the application of these useful measures are restricted to steady state models. Seasonal changes, environmental impacts, and climate shifts are not accommodated by the current methodology, which greatly limits their application. The novel methodology introduced in this paper extends the application of these useful but limited measures to dynamic compartmental models. This method relies on network particle tracking simulation, which is an agent based algorithm, whereas the current methods utilize steady-state flow rates and compartment storage values. We apply this new methodology to storage analysis, which quantifies how much storage is generated at any compartment within the system by a unit external input into another compartment. Also called compartmental mean residence time, this measure is widely used in environmental sciences, pharmacokinetics and nutrition, to assess the interaction between system boundary (e.g. drug intake, pollution, feeding) and internal compartments (e.g. tissues, crops, species). Storage analysis is chosen for demonstration because it is applicable to a limited class of dynamic models (linear and donor-controlled), which gives us an opportunity to verify our new method. The methodology introduced here is also applicable to Finn's cycling index, indirect effects index, throughflow analysis, and possibly other network analysis based indicators as well.

AB  - Redox sensitive elements serve as useful proxies of the oxygenation state of ancient environments, but their interpretation may not always be straightforward. To evaluate the inherent complexities, rare earths and yttrium (REY), iodine, and major element concentrations are determined in two carbonate sections spanning the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) transition in Demirtas, Turkey and Cili, South China. We use major oxides to identify non-seawater REV sources such as siliciclastics, Fe-oxides, phosphates and diagenetic fluids. Additionally, we employ Y/Ho ratio, La anomaly, and light rare earth element depletion to identify which samples preserve a seawater-like REYSN distribution. In contrast to past interpretations, we find that the P-Tr boundary microbialites in both sections contain REY signatures indicative of deposition in an oxic environment These boundary microbialites have their base at the extinction horizon and are widespread within the Tethyan region. In the Cili section, the underlying Permian limestone also preserves a seawater-like REY signature with a negative Ce anomaly. This indicates that the water column was oxygenated both before and after the extinction event The Permian limestone in the Demirtas section does not preserve a seawater-like REYSN distribution, so the absence of a Ce anomaly cannot be used to distinguish prevailing redox conditions during deposition. However, in these samples, we find the presence of a diverse Permian benthic community sufficient to identify deposition in an oxic environment The geochemical evidence for a continuously oxic environment during the deposition of the boundary microbialite presented in this study strongly supports work done using ostracods as redox indicators within the boundary microbialite in South China. The microbialite has been proposed as a disaster facies, in part resulting from the exclusion of grazers. Although anoxia is one of the suggested mechanisms for the exclusion of grazers, we find that it is not supported by geochemical and biotic evidence. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, we tested five trophic indicators and we demonstrated their usefulness to assess the environmental status of marine ecosystems and to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). The tested indicators include the slope of the biomass spectrum, the mean trophic level (MTL), the marine trophic index (MTI) and two newly developed indicators, the high trophic level indicator (HTI) and the apex predator indicator (API). Indicators are compared between current state and potential reference situations, using as case studies: the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay, North Sea and English Channel ecosystems. Trophic spectra are obtained from Ecopath models while reference situations are estimated, simulating with EcoTroph and Ecosim different fishing pressures including three candidate scenarios for an EAFM. Inter-ecosystems assessments are done using Ecopath models, simulations outputs and scientific surveys data to assess the current states of the studied ecosystems, contrast the reference situations and analyze the responses of all indicators. Sensitivity analyses are also conducted on the main simulation parameters to test the robustness of the chosen indicators. Ecosystems specific targets for EAFM are proposed for the five trophic indicators estimated from whole-ecosystem models, while in the Celtic Sea/Bay of Biscay ecosystem targets are proposed for the MTL (=3.85) and HTI (48%) estimated from standard bottom-trawl surveys. The HTI is proposed to be relevant for survey data and the API is recommended using whole-ecosystem models. We conclude that HTI and API show trends in ecosystems health better than MTI.

AB  - Within the context of growing economic integration in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), recent questions have been raised with regard to how member states employ law as a means of regional integration to promote sustainable development. Taking into account the primacy of ecosystem services for sustainability, this study examines the coherence of legal frameworks for ecosystem services among ASEAN member states toward a unified regional legal agenda for sustainable mineral development. Analyzed along three aspects of the Ecosystem Services Approach, the paper reviews the different mining related legislations and implementing regulations of member states, and examines whether there is convergence in their legal provisions for ecosystem services. The study shows that all member states provide legal mechanisms for ecosystem management in their mining operations. However, the following could be noted: 1) a lack of coherent identification and targeting of ecosystem services despite 'intermediate' services being embedded in provisions for ecosystem conservation; 2) a lack of legal provisions for integration of ecosystem services in mining impact assessments, and for ecosystem services valuation, which render environmental impact assessments, compensation structures and royalty regimes inadequate; and 3) a density of legal differentials around how states allocate regulatory authorities for ecosystem management in mining. These represent a prevailing fragmentation among member states' legal frameworks for ecosystem services, which does not create an enabling condition for legal integration in ASEAN's regional mineral strategies for sustainable development.

AB  - The ever-increasing interest in mining of sand in shallow waters of many rural rivers on the one hand and the growing concern for the environment on the other underscore the need to develop better management policies that govern sand extraction. Although literature pointing to increased environmental consciousness by some mining operations exists, the link between environmental concerns and sand mining has however remained a controversial matter and an under-researched area in South Africa. Consequently, decisions relating to what actions should or should not be taken to limit environmental concerns associated with sand mining operations in South Africa are not known. This analysis sought to explore regulatory and policy implications of sand mining operations along a sample of sites of Njelele River in South Africa. Data were gathered through observation, household questionnaire survey and a series of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) exercises conducted with selected community members and sand miners. We used a combination of K-means clustering and Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) to determine the major environmental attributes explaining the state of affairs in sand mining. Regulatory and policy implications were developed using a combination of Gap analysis; Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis; and the development of a Threats, Opportunities, Weaknesses and Strengths (TOWS) matrix strategy. Our analysis identified a series of morphological, ecological, socio-ecological, governance and physical factors that were major areas of concern in three distinct clusters of sand mining sites. We concluded by discussing a number of regulatory and policy implications of sand mining at three scales, namely strategic, institutional and operational scales.

AB  - Dredging presents a risk of injury or mortality to marine turtles via entrainment, vessel strike or the effects of noise and vibration. Dredging operations have increased in recent years, yet there remains an absence of supporting information for development proponents and regulators to accurately determine dredge-related impact predictions for marine turtles within an Environmental Impact Assessment This absence therefore has implications for their conservation, as certain dredging impacts may be overlooked or the implementation of control measures and response strategies may be ineffective.
   This study presents a case study involving a major resource development whose proponent undertook satellite tracking of 48 reproductively-active flatback turtles (Natator depressus) at different stages of its dredging operation (before: n = 20, during: n = 10 and after: n = 18). In addition, trained Marine Fauna Observers were on-board dredge vessels to mitigate interaction and detect injury and mortality events. We compared the dredge-related impact predictions stated in the Environmental Impact Assessment with the quantified dredge-related impact to flatback turtles as represented by changes to their movement and dive behaviour between each stage of the dredging operation and any injury and mortality events. Additionally, we considered the effectiveness of implemented dredge-related control measures in preventing their injury or mortality.
   We found that during the active dredging operation, flatback turtles increased their use of the dredging areas. Dive behaviour results showed they undertook longer and deeper resting dives during dredging, utilising the now deeper waters of the dredging areas. Possible reasons for this preferential use of areas being dredged are discussed. Despite their increased use and the presence of active dredge vessels, no events of injury or mortality were recorded. The implemented control measures may have been effective in preventing injury or mortality, though the spatial scale of their effectiveness may have been smaller than first anticipated.
   Our results are of great value for stakeholders involved in marine turtle conservation and managing dredging operations worldwide as no comparison of quantified marine turtle survivorship, movement and dive behaviour data at different stages of a dredging program has been recorded or reported previously.

AB  - Throughout the western states, riparian ecosystems have been affected by water diversions or spring and seep developments that decrease the quantity of instream flows and result in lowered water-tables. Water extraction is especially damaging in arid and semi-arid regions where the presence of instream and ground-water flows are crucial to riparian vegetation. We examined the temporal and spatial relationships between hydrologic gradients, vegetation, and soils in two central Nevada riparian meadows in order to identify plant species and environmental variables that can serve as indicators of water-table status. Species frequency and aerial cover, ground-cover composition, depth to water-table, and soil morphological and physical properties were measured along hydrologic gradients within two riparian meadow complexes. TWINSPAN, cluster, and multivariate discriminant analyses classified the vegetation into four ecosystem types. These occurred along the hydrologic gradient and included, from wettest to driest, wet meadow, mesic meadow, dry meadow, and basin big sagebrush meadow types. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the variables most strongly related to plant species frequency within both meadows were those associated with depth to water-table. Integrative variables, including the number of days that depth to watertable was less than 30 cm and less than 70 cm, and degree-days of anaerobiosis were most closely related to the wet and mesic meadow vegetation types. The range in depth to water-table, elevation, and aerial cover of gravel and litter were all related to the dry and sagebrush meadow vegetation types. Indicator species associated with particular water-table regimes were identified for each vegetation type based on two-way ordered tables. Carer nebrascensis, an obligate riparian species, occurred at water-tables of 0-30 cm below the surface and was the most reliable indicator of shallow water-tables. Large temporal and spatial variability in water-table depths for the mesic and dry meadow types suggests that species associated with these types could be used only to indicate broad ranges in water-table depth. Integrative environmental variables that incorporated the temporal variation in water-tables (i.e., days that depth to water-table was less than 30 and 70 cm; degree days of anaerobiosis; range in water-table depth during the growing season) demonstrated closer relationships to the vegetation types than water-table alone. They were also more sensitive to the spatial and temporal differences in water-tables than individual plant species or vegetation types. Environmental and integrative environmental variables may respond more quickly to changes in local hydrology than plant species and are possibly more sensitive indicators of both current water-table status and potential vegetation.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to study the role and assess the small business development influence on the economic development of the region. Methods. Theoretical and methodological foundations of the research draw up the scientists' works on the problems of economic development of the regions. During the scientific research, a complex of such methods was used: generalization and scientific abstraction - in order to specify the conceptual-categorical instrument and identify characteristics of the small business; monographic - in case of highlighting the scientists' views on the investigated problems; comparative analysis - when identifying features of small business influence on the economic development of the region; mathematical modelling in economics - to develop the methodology for the evaluation of small business development influence on the economic development of the region. Results. Special aspects of small business functioning as a factor of the economic development of the region that accommodates economic growth, the improvement of the product quality and social indicators of development, formation of the middle class, decrease of the unemployment rate, increase of the population living standards are researched. The ambiguity of approaches to the small business definition is established, the characteristic feature of which, in most cases, is the number of employees. However, the small business is distinguished for industrial enterprises and service-oriented companies, based on the structure of management, and also taking into account the self-regulation of small enterprises or their relations to the large enterprises or industrial group of companies. It is established that criteria for the evaluation of the efficiency of small business enterprises can be: increase in the entrepreneurship development rates, minimization of material and social losses of the society, increasing the share of small business in GDP formation, raising the level of social protection of the employee. Method of the evaluation of small business development influence on the economic development of the region is proposed, which provides: the allocation of the priority areas of activity of small business entities that have a positive effect on the correspond territory; formation of the aggregate indices representing each of these areas; establishment of connection between the researched areas of the small business influence with the economic development of the region; building-up the compound integrated index based on the results of the correlation analysis parameters that have an effect on the economic development of regions; evaluation of the contribution extent of the small business to the economic development level of each region. Practical meaning. It is established that the functioning of small businesses significantly influences the sectoral structure of the territory and the level of the population employment, while the influence on the infrastructure and the ecological state of the region is not so considerable. Factors, that determine the efficiency level of the small business functioning and also have a significant influence on the economic development level of the region are singled out, namely: the number of small enterprises; products sold turnover; the number of employed and the proportion of employees in the small businesses.
   Taking into account the specifics of small business, its strong influence on the economic condition of the local territories is substantiated, which in its turn determines the necessity for conducting the complementary measurements involving a local survey of the statistical information, particularly in large cities, mountainous areas, zones of ecological disaster. The methodology for the evaluation of the small businesses functioning at the local level allows us to specify actual reasons that stem the tide of small business in existing locations and to formulate the measures for their elimination. Value/originality. On the ground of the conducted research, the conceptual principles of the small business influence assessment on the economic development of the region are proposed, which took the basis of the scientific research on formation effective model sustainable development region.

AB  - The ecological environment is the foundation of human survival and development, and forest ecosystem nature reserves play an important role in the protection of the ecological environment. The evaluation of forest ecosystem nature reserves facilitates the formulation of relevant management policies. At present, the evaluation of the ecological environment of forest ecosystem nature reserves is mainly based on detailed evaluation of some elements of the ecological environment, rather than on a comprehensive quantitative evaluation that reflects the ecological environment in many aspects. To address this shortcoming, the quantitative evaluation indicator system of comprehensive ecological environment for forest ecosystem nature reserves was established based on the water, air, soil, and biological environments, according to the consensus on ecological environment in the past research and characteristics of the research area. The weight is still a necessary and important link in the evaluation of forest ecosystem nature reserves, but the accuracy of the weight results is difficult to get a scientific judgment. To prevent the evaluation results being influenced by weighting uncertainty, an unweighted cloud model was constructed to provide an evaluation mechanism without weight. The ecological environment evaluation was then carried out using the unweighted cloud model, taking Songshan Nature Reserve as a research area. The results show that the grades of the ecological environment of Songshan Nature Reserve are 21% excellent, 67% good, and 12% qualified, and that the state of the ecological environment is stable and performing well. The evaluation results for the grades of the environmental dimension layers are water environment > soil environment > biological environment > air environment. The study's research results can provide theoretical support for the evaluation of forest ecosystem nature reserves, and for evaluation work in general when weights are difficult to determine or uncertain.

AB  - Alternatives studies are considered as one of the best practice principles of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Without an alternative study, EIA is reduced to proposition of mitigating measures of impacts that could have been avoided. Despite the growing academic interest, there are still few studies dealing with location alternatives, especially in the mad transport sector. Therefore. the present research aims to evaluate how the consideration of alternatives has been developed within the EIA processes of roads processed in environmental agency of Minas Gerais state. The selection of case studies aimed to find environmental licensing processes of roads processed in Minas Gerais state and based on Environmental Impact Studies (EIS) and then compare criteria used for the selection of alternatives of those cases with the best practices recommended in the literature. In Integrated Environmental Information System (Sistema Integrado de Informacoes Ambientais - SIAM), 10 cases were found in overall Minas Gerais state, of which three required EIS elaboration, and all of them had study of location alternatives. From the literature, a series of general criteria to be addressed and common failures that need to be avoided during the elaboration of alternatives studies was found. When comparing them with the cases, a worrying result appeared, since all alternatives studies presented themselves in a precarious way, with information without detailing and failures that could have been avoided, while meeting some good practice criteria. Thus, it can be said that in environmental agency of Minas Gerais state, location alternatives study for roads is considered fragile, and there is no necessary and due consideration of this essential factor in decision making on environmental viability.

AB  - Restoration is becoming an increasing global priority. Particularly in high impact developments like open cut mining, restoring ecosystems to pre-disturbance states is difficult but essential. Successful restoration of vegetation communities requires complex achievements of cover, density, community composition, species richness, and structural elements. This study synthesises 10years of monitoring surveys to measure restoration success in six mining operations in the semi-arid Pilbara of Western Australia, with the goal of quantifying current and past restoration performance. We assessed composition, structure, cover, density, and richness. We found that each metric resulted in slightly different performance measures within mining operations. For example, native perennial grasses in restored sites fell short of reference density and cover, while woody species density and cover were regularly within the reference range. Richness was often much higher in restored than in reference sites. Finally, to explore the potential drivers of performance, we analysed the influence of restoration characteristics on each of the vegetation metrics. We found that older restoration had increased cover and density of all vegetation types compared to more recent restoration, while other variables had impacts on restoration results that shifted between metrics and monitoring periods. Compositional similarity with reference sites was higher when restoration occurred on low impact mining activities, when first year rainfall was higher, and when seeding treatments were not applied. Overall, this assessment of long-term monitoring data highlighted where each performance measure was important to understanding overall restoration patterns in semi-arid systems and paves the way for improving future restoration practice.

AB  - The present paper analyses the State of Air quality in Greece based on a series of environmental indicators related to state, drivers and pressures. The air quality assessment for the period 2001-2009 refers to population resident in Metropolitan Area of Athens, and there was no clear trend over the reporting period. The limit of 120 mu g/m(3) for ozone has not been exceeded for 50-70% of population; however, the pattern is not consistent, indicating even up to 100% exceedance more than 25 days in a couple of years. Up to 85% of the resident population was exposed to NO2 annual mean concentrations in the range of the annual indicative target limits, with a few exceptions. Less than 4% of the above urban population was exposed to daily mean PM10 concentrations in excess of the indicative limits set for each year, except for years with high construction activity (up to 30%). There was no exceedance of the EU limit for SO2 daily mean.
   The share of transport to ozone precursor emissions is currently the highest, followed by energy supply. Energy supply has the highest share in the emissions of acidifying substances and secondary particulate matter. Emissions of particulate matter and acidifying substances from the transport sector were almost stable between 1990 and 2009, whereas the transport emissions of ozone precursors decreased by 1/3. Although the NOx emissions remained the same, there is a great decrease in CO and NMVOC emissions due to the continuing increase of passenger cars with catalytic converters.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the potential of indicators for integrated river basin management and to develop a set of indicators for the management of transboundary river basins. An indicator, comprising a variable or some aggregation of variables, describes a system pr process such that it has significance beyond the face value of its components. Integrated river basin management lakes into account policies and measures for the multifunctional use of rivers on a catchment scale and associated institutional changes. Indicators are useful instruments for this process for two reasons. Firstly, they meet the information need of policy- and decision-makers. Secondly, indicators can be used to structure the definition and description of information needs and collection of information between the different international, institutional, and sectoral management levels. The development of indicators-involves a number of steps: definition of aim, construction of conceptual model, selection of variables, comparison with selection criteria, database assess ment, and indicator selection. In this paper these steps are discussed and specified for integrated river basin management. This results in a set of indicators describing the pressure to the river, the state of the river ecosystem, the impact to goods and services provided by the river, and:the societal response. The proposed set of indicators measured at a river basin scale provides integrated information an the use and supply of goods;and services, underlying cause-effect relationships and possible trade-offs and their spatial distribution (e,g., upstream versus downstream). Furthermore, we propose a division of tasks and responsibilities for river basin management with regard to the development of indicators, data collection, and their application in decision-making.

AB  - Remote sensing allows for cost- and time-efficient monitoring of landscapes vital to the conservation of natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This review synthesizes and recommends best practice change detection methods for land management groups to monitor chief ecological change indicators currently monitored in United States protected areas. The indicators frequently monitored via change detection and reviewed here include: land use/land cover, disturbance, and phenology. Landsat data products are recommended for monitoring land use/land cover and disturbance, due to their continuous data accessibility free of cost since 1972. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are recommended for monitoring changes in phenology due to its 1-2 day return, interval at any given location. Best-practice remote sensing methods are stressed, such as careful validation of results, either by combination of remotely sensed datasets with high resolution imagery or in situ data, in order to increase accuracy and to better align the remotely sensed data to the scale of the on-the-ground processes. Reported results should always be presented with utmost clarity in a manner that is both applicable to managers and understood by the general public. Increased collaborations between ecologists, land managers, conservation groups, and scientists are compulsory for successful integration of remote sensing-based monitoting, which is vital for effective conservation in protected areas. Remote sensing change detection quantifies the effects of humans on a landscape scale without creating further disturbances to ecologically sensitive areas; the results of which can be used for efficient conservation management into the future.

AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is an important biochemical state indicator of aquatic ecosystems. However, its retrieval from remote sensing datasets remains a challenging task due to its high spatiotemporal variability and interference from other water constituents. In this article, we aim to develop new CDOM inversion algorithms by taking advantage of a representative sparse learning algorithm known as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which is applied to identify the optimal band arithmetic terms for the CDOM inversion and estimate the model parameters in a more global and robust manner than can statistics-based methods. Moreover, a two-stage inversion framework is presented to further enhance the stability of LASSO in addressing inadequate in situ sample circumstances. Within the framework, two different schemes are proposed to handle the band arithmetic terms information propagation between the two stages, for which two new algorithms are proposed. Experimental results obtained from the in situ bio-optical dataset and the synthesized dataset under various training sample sizes indicate that both of the proposed algorithms can deliver performance superior to six state-of-the-art CDOM inversion algorithms, and with less sensitivity to the training sample states. In addition, the results offered by the new algorithms also enjoy biochemical interpretability, revealing that the red/blue ratio terms are well suited for inverting the CDOM content on these datasets.

AB  - From a systemic perspective, evolution and natural succession promote the creation of efficient biological structures and processes that capture and dissipate the solar energy, maximizing the entropy production. This ecological complexification results in better ecosystem thermodynamic performance indicated by lower temperature.
   In a brief period of evolutionary time human-induced disturbance has altered profoundly the structure and functioning of the Earth System, i.e. ecological simplification.
   The objective is to understand whether remote sensing data can be considered appropriate proxy indicators to test if more mature and complex ecosystems have higher entropy production rates which lead to lower and attenuated ecosystem temperatures.
   Simple remote sensing measurements of Madeira Island for Thermal Infrared Radiation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were used to analyse the surface temperature and biomass cover of Madeira ecosystems spectrum of different states of human-induced disturbance.
   The findings revealed it was possible to distinguish between ecosystem types using thermodynamic indicators, where older ecosystems with more complex structures exhibit more attenuated lower average temperatures. It was also found that habitat heterogeneity can represent either artificial (human) or natural disturbance with opposite consequences in the ecosystem thermal signature, i.e. lower temperature when natural disturbance and higher if anthropogenic disturbance.
   Simple thermal remote sensing data can be used as systemic indicator of ecosystem health by reflecting it levels of eco-exergy, i.e the available work energy in the ecosystem.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge to individuals' mental health. People worldwide are experiencing increased stress, negative affect, and posttraumatic stress symptoms, which may lead to eating problems. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the perceived severity of COVID-19 on eating problems and the mediating effects of stress/negative affect/posttraumatic stress symptoms both at the personal level and interpersonal level. Methods: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a total of 108 college students were recruited to report their perceived severity of COVID-19, stress, negative affect, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and eating problems three times a day for seven consecutive days using Ecological Momentary Assessment. Results: State perceived severity of COVID-19 predicted fewer subsequent eating problems in daily life at the personal level. Both state negative affect and posttraumatic stress symptoms were positively associated with eating problems in daily life. At the interpersonal level, trait-like perceived severity of COVID-19, stress, negative affect, and posttraumatic stress symptoms were positively associated with overall eating problems. There were no mediating effects of stress/negative affect/posttraumatic stress symptoms on the relations between perceived severity of COVID-19 and eating problems at the personal/interpersonal level. Conclusions: The perceived severity of COVID-19, stress, negative affect, and posttraumatic stress symptoms might increase the risk of eating problems.

AB  - Eutrophication became a dominant process in the Mondego estuarine system in the 1980s, presumably as a result of excessive nutrient release into coastal waters. The main symptoms were the occurrence of seasonal blooms of Enteromorpha spp., green macroalgae, and a drastic reduction of the Zostera noltii meadows. Previous results suggest that this process will determine changes in species composition at other trophic levels. This paper aims at integrating the available information to provide a theoretical interpretation of the recent physicochemical and biological changes in the Mondego estuarine ecosystem, which will be further used as basic framework for the development of a structurally dynamic model. Exergy-based indices, the Exergy Index and Specific Exergy, were applied as ecological indicators (orientors) to describe the state of the ecosystem, taking into account different scenarios along a spatial gradient of eutrophication symptoms. This allowed elucidating the present conditions along the spatial gradient as representing various stages in the temporal evolution of the system, within the framework of bifurcation, Chaos, and Catastrophe theories. Eutrophication appeared as the major driving force behind the gradual shift in primary producers from a community dominated by rooted macrophytes (Z. noltii) to a community dominated by green macroalgae. Through time, concomitant changes at other trophic levels will most probably give origin to a new trophic structure. Moreover, river management emerged as a key question in establishing scenarios in order to determine secondary effects in eutrophied systems. Results suggest that a more conservative river management may be used as a powerful tool to remedy affected areas, including the implementation of ecological engineering principles in different possible management practices. The recent biological changes in the Mondego estuarine ecosystem were found to comply with the framework of the theories considered, while both Exergy-based indices were able to capture the state of the system and distinguish between different scenarios.

AB  - Across scientific fields, there have been calls to improve the integration of scientific knowledge in policy making. Particularly since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, these calls increasingly refer to data on human well-being related to the natural environment. However, policy decisions involve selective uptake of information across communities with different preferences and decision-making processes. Additionally, researchers face the fact that there are important trade-offs in producing knowledge that is simultaneously credible, legitimate, socially relevant, and socially just. We present a study that developed human well-being indicators for Washington State's Puget Sound ecosystem recovery agency over 3 years. Stakeholders, decision makers, and social scientists were engaged in the identification, modification, and prioritization of well-being indicators that were adopted by the agency for tracking progress toward ecosystem recovery and strategic planning. After substantial literature review, interviews, workshops, and indicator ranking exercises, 15 indicators were broadly accepted and important to all audiences. Although the scientists, decision makers, and stakeholders used different criteria to identify and prioritize indicators, they all agreed that indicators associated with each of 6 broad domains (social, cultural, psychological, physical, economic, and governance) were critical to assess the holistic concept of well-being related to ecosystem restoration. Decision makers preferred indicators that mirrored stakeholder preferences, whereas social scientists preferred only a subset. The Puget Sound indicator development process provides an example for identifying, selecting, and monitoring diverse concepts of well-being related to environmental restoration in a way that promotes recognition, participation, and a fair distribution of environmental benefits across the region.

AB  - In recent years, many of micropollutants have been widely detected because of continuous input of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) into the environment and newly developed state-of-the-art analytical methods. PPCP residues are frequently detected in drinking water sources, sewage treatment plants (STPs), and water treatment plants (WTPs) due to their universal consumption, low human metabolic capability, and improper disposal. When partially metabolized PPCPs are transferred into STPs, they elicit negative effects on biological treatment processes; therefore, conventional STPs are insufficient when it comes to PPCP removal. Furthermore, the excreted metabolites may become secondary pollutants and can be further modified in receiving water bodies. Several advanced treatment systems, including membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, and advanced oxidation processes, have been used for the effective removal of individual PPCPs. This review covers the occurrence patterns of PPCPs in water environments and the techniques adopted for their treatment in STP/WTP unit processes operating in various countries. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the removal and fate of PPCPs in different treatment facilities as well as the optimum methods for their elimination in STP and WTP systems.

AB  - Stability and productivity are important indicators used to measure the state of forest ecosystems. Artificial forests populations with reasonable structures and strong stability are critical for ecosystem productivity. Previous studies have focused on individual factors, while the mechanisms of how multiple factors affect population productivity remain unknown. We used 57 plots in a Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) plantation to investigate 23 stand factors and analyzed the relationships among site factors, population structure, population stability, and population productivity using partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results showed that the population productivity of the plantation was directly affected by the population stability latent variable but indirectly affected by the site conditions latent variables (indirect effect path coefficient = 0.249) and forest structure (indirect effect path coefficient = 0.222). However, the site conditions latent variable was the main factor directly affecting the population stability latent variables; the total effect was 0.511 (direct effect path coefficient = 0.307, indirect effect path coefficient = 0.204), and the influence of forest structure on population stability was lower than that of the site conditions latent variable (direct effect path coefficient = 0.454). The factor with the greatest weight among the site conditions latent variable was slope (0.747), indicating that slope contributes the most to latent variables related to forest population stability. Among all variables affecting the forest stability latent variables, forest density had the highest weight value (0.803), and the weight value of forest mortality was lower than that of forest density. The weights of the latent variables associated with population structure from high to low were canopy density, the uniform angle index, and the spatial competition index, indicating that competition for space had the lowest influence on the population stability latent variables. The results provide new insights and ideas for quantifying relationships among different driving factors and a basis for scientific and rational plantation management.

AB  - Assessment of key environmental factors that influence vegetation distribution and formation of plant communities is one of the most important challenges in modem phytocenology. Nowadays, several bioindication systems are applied to determine ecological specificity of plant communities and to establish the leading factors for their environmental differentiation. The system most widely used in Europe, that of H. Ellenberg, contains a numerical score on 6 ecological factors. On the example of vegetation of the valley of the Liman Kuyalnik, Y. Didukh developed the synphytoindication method based on evaluation of phytocenoses with respect to 12 ecological factors: 7 edaphic factors and 5 climatic factors; the method determines a more accurate and complete presentation of the analysis. hi the valley of the Liman Kuyalnik (Odesa Oblast) the largest area is covered with halophytic and steppe vegetation. Halophytic vegetation (Therosalicornietea, Festuco-Puccinellietea classes, Juncetea maritimi, Bolboschoenetea maritimi) predominated in the shoreline areas of the valley, whereas steppe (Festuco-Brometea) and petrophytic (Sedo-Scleranthetea) vegetation dominated on the slope sites. With the application of DCA-ordination and synphytoindication methods it was established that distribution of plant communities in the hyper-space of the environmental conditions was most strongly correlated with edaphic factors, whereas microclimatic (light intensity) and climatic (thermo-regime) conditions had somewhat less influence on their differentiation. Water regime and level of soil salinity served as key factors for syntaxa of halophytic vegetation; moisture variability and salt regime, as well as soil moisture and carbonate content were key factors for the steppe vegetation, and thermo-regime was the main factor for petrophytic-steppe and petrophytic vegetation. The "eco-spaces" of these groups largely overlap. Halophytic cenoses are characterized by quite wide ecological ranges by most ecological factors. Steppe communities show much less ecological diversity. hi the valley of the liman, all the steppe communities were characterized by stenotopicity in relation to most ecological factors; these factors complexly determine the specificity and diversity of biotopes within the valley, which are unique and require protection and the taking of appropriate measures, depending on the changes in activity of one or another limiting factor. Nowadays, the valley of the Liman Kuyalnik is in a state of environmental disaster. The established relationships in ecological differentiation of plant communities will be applied to further monitoring of biodiversity state, preservation and possible restoration of vegetation types that were native for this unique territory.

AB  - Although remarkable progress has been achieved in reducing hunger and poverty and improving people's health in the past couple of decades, humanity still faces considerable socio-economic and sustainability challenges. Ensuring sustainable access to safe and sufficient water, improved sanitation facilities, clean energy sources and healthy food is a necessary requirement for ending hunger and poverty, advancing health and achieving all the goals of the sustainable development agenda. Socio-economic variables are determinant factors of water, energy and food accessibility. Ecological region, income and education are measures used in this study, which aims to examine a pairwise comparison of water and energy sources, sanitation facilities and food accessibilities in six sampling communities and tracking progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDG) at a local scale using nine specific SDG indicators. A study involving questionnaire administration covering 1785 households across the three ecological regions of Katsina state was performed. Two communities representing urban and rural households from each of the ecological regions were selected. An analysis of variance was used to test the equality of resource accessibility across the investigated communities followed up by a post hoc analysis to identify significant mean groups. The results showed that the overall access level to safely manage water and sanitation facilities were 16.5% and 28.1%, respectively. Access indices of 1.83 and 1.24 for electricity and cooking fuel, respectively, were calculated in the study area. The study revealed that location, education and income are the key drivers of water, energy and food access and choice.

AB  - Since 2010, a bottom-up initiative has been launched in Santorini Island (Aegean Sea, Eastern Mediterranean) for the establishment of the first fully protected marine protected area in the Cyclades, aiming at improving fisheries and enhancing responsible recreational uses at sea. Following discussions with local small-scale fishermen and divers, two sites along the southern and south-eastern coasts of the island were suggested as suitable to this end. In 2012, a baseline study was conducted in these areas to assess their state and provide an ecological snapshot that would enable sound designation and monitoring. Several ad hoc indices and metrics were applied, taking into account structural and functional features of the upper infralittoral algae and Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds. An integrated assessment of the infralittoral fish assemblages and their associated benthic communities was also performed. Our most important findings were: (i) the low total fish biomass and the absence of adult top predators, indicating overfishing; (ii) the overgrazing effects of the abundant alien herbivore spinefoot fishes (Siganus spp.), as reflected by the abnormal structure of the algal communities; (iii) the scarcity of indications of pollution or other direct anthropogenic pressures, as indicated by the good environmental status of the P. oceanica meadows and the upper infralittoral vegetation; and (iv) the presence of a rich diversity of species and habitats, especially along the Akrotiri Peninsula and the wider volcanic Caldera. These findings provide useful insights on the strengths and weaknesses of the study area and are discussed together with their implications for protection and management.

AB  - Quantitative camera surveys of benthic megafauna were carried out during the expedition ARK-XXVII/3 to the Eastern Central Arctic Basins with the research icebreaker Polarstern in summer 2012 (2 August-29 September). Nine transects were performed for the first time in deep-sea areas previously fully covered by ice, four of them in the Nansen Basin (3571-4066m) and five in the Amundsen Basin (4041-4384m). At seven of these stations benthic Agassiz trawls were taken near the camera tracks for species identification. Observed Arctic deep-sea megafauna was largely endemic. Several taxa showed a substantially greater depth or geographical range than previously assumed. Variations in the composition and structure of megabenthic communities were analysed and linked to several environmental variables, including state of the sea ice and phytodetritus supply to the seafloor. Three different types of communities were identified based on species dominating the biomass. Among these species were the actiniarian Bathyphellia margaritacea and the holothurians Elpidia heckeri and Kolga hyalina. Variations in megafaunal abundance were first of all related to the proximity to the marginal ice zone. Stations located closer to this zone were characterized by relatively high densities and biomass of B. margaritacea. Food supply was higher at these stations, as suggested by enhanced concentrations of pigments, organic carbon, bacterial cell abundances and nutrients in the sediments. Fully ice-covered stations closer to the North Pole and partially under multi-year ice were characterized by lower concentrations of the same biogeochemical indicators for food supply. These stations nevertheless hosted relatively high density and biomass of the holothurians E. heckeri or K. hyalina, which were observed to feed on large food falls of the sea-ice colonial diatom Melosira arctica. The link between the community structure of megafauna and the extent and condition of the Central Arctic sea-ice cover suggests that future climate changes may substantially affect deep ocean biodiversity.

AB  - On the territory of the Kirov region, since 1975, the Kilmez burial of pesticides (KBP) has been operated, where unusable chlorine, nitrogen, mercury, phosphorus, arsenic and copper-containing pesticides are buried. For many years, environmental monitoring of the state of vegetation, soil, atmospheric air, groundwater has been carried out on the territory near the KBP, background indicators have been established. In recent years, a tendency to an increase in pollutants in the studied objects has been revealed, which may indicate the need for landfill reclamation work and a comprehensive survey of the adjacent territory.
   Research conducted in 2015-2018 showed that in the water of the Loban' and Osinovka rivers flowing near the landfill the content of most of the studied ions did not exceed the maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) and background values. The exception was the content of ammonium ions, the concentration values of which changed significantly: in 2015-2016 exceeded MPCfish and MPCdrink up to 8.4 and 2.2 times, respectively, while in 2017-2018 there was no excess, and in 2020 the excess of the MPC was again revealed. No influence of the landfill on the chemical composition and toxicity of the water of the Loban' river located at a farther distance from the landfill was revealed, while in water samples from the Osinovka river and in the bottom sediments, an increase in the content of copper, whose compounds are included in the buried waste, was noted with an approach to the landfill. Water samples from the studied streams do not have an acute toxic effect according to the Daphnia magna Straus biotest. In general, according to the results of the studies carried out, the condition of the Loban' and Osinovka rivers can be characterized as satisfactory.

AB  - Low birth weight (LBW), defined as a live birth weighing less than 2500 g, is a significant public health problem in the United States, but the complex nature of the etiology of this problem is not fully understood. Moreover, significant disparities in LBW prevalence are well documented among certain populations, particularly in minority and underserved communities. The identification of spatial patterns of LBW prevalence is a critical first step in a more complete understanding of the epidemiology of this public health challenge and these techniques are instrumental in designing valid observational and analytical studies to more fully study the problem. This paper examines the spatial patterns of LBW prevalence, as well as the presence of spatial clusters in the State of Georgia at both the county and census tract levels. Unadjusted and empirical Bayes smoothed LBW rates were mapped to visualize the spatial variation of LBW rates, and the Moran's I statistic and the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) statistic were computed to assess the degree of spatial dependence in the LBW rates. Results revealed marked geographical variation in LBW prevalence in Georgia in 2000. In addition, these data validate the significant disparity (two-fold difference) between white and black racial subgroups as documented in the literature. Trends associated with positive and negative spatial autocorrelations illustrated variation with respect to race. Limitations of data and methods, as well as plans for utility of the results of this study for further investigation were discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Over the last century butterflies have undergone substantial changes in abundance and range in Great Britain and monitoring has improved markedly. These changes, together with a major revision of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria, render previous Red List assessments outdated.
   2. A new Red List assessment of all 62 resident and regularly breeding butterfly species in Britain was undertaken. The current IUCN criteria were applied for the first time to British butterflies using data from the Butterflies for the New Millennium recording scheme and the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme.
   3. The state of knowledge and nature of the data available from these two schemes enabled assessment to be based upon two quantitative IUCN criteria: A2 (rate of population decline) and B2 (area of occupancy).
   4. Twenty-three species (37% of the total) qualified as Regionally Extinct (RE) or threatened: 4 species were listed as RE and 19 as threatened (two Critically Endangered, eight Endangered and nine Vulnerable). A further 11 species were classified as Near Threatened. The remaining 28 species (45% of the total) were classified as Least Concern.
   5. In comparison with previous assessments, we show that the number of species classified as threatened has increased. This is likely to be due to a combination of refined assessment criteria, improved data, and a real increase in the extinction threat as a result of human impacts.
   6. The results confirm butterflies as a highly threatened group of insects in Great Britain and the Red List provides an important foundation to define conservation priorities.

AB  - Post-prosthetic complications during dental implantation are accompanied by pain symptoms leading to disorders of the psychoemotional state. All this influences the behavior of patients. In addition, psychoemotional stress is often a factor of provocation and persistence of the complications. The presence of a stress state in the identified pathology, as well as the influence of various therapies on the treatment of post-prosthetic complications, is reflected in the dynamics of changes in the concentrations of both catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) and glucocorticoids (cortisol) - hormones of the medulla and the adrenal cortex. THE AIM: to conduct an immunological analysis of the stress response in patients with postprosthetic complications during dental implantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed in 120 patients with post-prosthetic complications during dental implantation before and during treatment: Group I (control) - 30 patients treated with the conventional therapy; group II - 30 patients treated with ozone therapy in addition to the conventional therapy; group III - 30 patients treated with transcranial electrical stimulation in addition to the conventional therapy; Group IV - 30 patients treated with a combination of conventional therapy, ozone therapy and transcranial electrical stimulation. The concentration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, alkaline phosphatase, and the Garkavi index were evaluated. RESULTS: The change in these indicators after the treatment indicates the normalization of the level of the studied enzymes - markers of bone homeostasis, which is confirmed by an improvement in the clinical picture in the oral cavity. CONCLUSION: changes in immunological parameters objectively reflect the psychoemotional state of patients. The nature of changes in the hormonal stress response to the treatment ofpost-prosthetic complications indicates the effectiveness of the therapeutic regimens used, and, as a result, a decrease in both pain symptoms and psychoemotional stress.

AB  - The result presented in this paper is the format construction of a frame algorithm for an integrated assessment rather than its application and corresponding detailed calculations which are underway (research project GLOWA-Elbe: Global Change of the Water Cycle). It is assumed that the research goals can be represented and achieved by a collection of optimization tasks - the so-called masterscenarios which are specific applications of the constructed algorithm. The objects of investigation of the scenarios are sub-regions of a river drainage basin, e.g,, the Elbe river basin, forming complex landscape units which are defined by their mutually dependent environmental, economic and social states or parameters. Possible masterscenario tasks are qualitative and realistic target states for the landscape units which can be met by management in different ways and on different quantitative levels. First of all, the scope of fields and potentials for activities have to be explored. In another step, states and aggregated indicators are defined which reflect these qualities and quantity levels and, in this way, allow comparisons and the definition of criteria for evaluation. Evolution processes which affect the river basin but cannot be managed endogenously may be driven exogenously by anticipated climate change and by demographic, economic, social or technological developments. The algorithm focuses the available information on a sequence of three computer-aided analyses: Impact Analysis (IA), Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) and Equity Analysis (EA). IA is realized by offline studies with the help of numerous partial expert models; EA is intended to organize compromises between concerned interest groups. MCA produces a ranking of all possible alternative solutions using a set of criteria. IA has to produce partial evaluations of all alternatives with respect to all selected criteria. The ranking of alternatives may be used to support planning procedures and decisions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Researchers recognize that ionization state may influence the biological activity of weak acids and bases. Dissociation in aqueous solutions is controlled by the pKa of a compound and the pH of the matrix. Because many pharmaceuticals are implicitly designed as ionizable compounds, site-specific variability in pH of receiving waters may introduce uncertainty to ecological risk assessments. The present study employed 48-h and 7-d toxicity tests with Pimephales promelas exposed to the model weak base pharmaceutical sertraline over a gradient of environmentally relevant surface water pHs. The 48-h experiments were completed in triplicate, and the average lethal concentration values were 647, 205, and 72 mg/L sertraline at pH 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, respectively. Survivorship, growth, and feeding rate (a nontraditional endpoint linked by other researchers to sertraline's specific mode of action) were monitored during the 7-d experiment. Adverse effects were more pronounced when individuals were exposed to sertraline at pH 8.5 compared to pH 7.5 and 6.5. The pH-dependent toxicological relationships from these studies were related to in-stream pH data for two streams in the Brazos River basin of central Texas, USA. This predictive approach was taken because of the scarcity of environmental analytical data for sertraline. The results of this study emphasized temporal variability associated with in-stream pH linked to seasonal differences within and between these spatially related systems. Relating site-specific pH variability of surface waters to ionization state may allow researchers to reduce uncertainty during ecological risk assessment of pharmaceuticals by improving estimates of biological effects associated with exposure.

AB  - Background: Our goal was to accurately detect young children at risk for long-term psychiatric disturbances after potentially traumatic experiences in the course of relocation. In addition to detailed assessment of parent-rated parent and child symptomatology, we focused on disruptive behaviors in the education environment summarized as survival states, as these frequently lead to clinical referral.
   Methods: We screened 52 refugee children aged 3-7 (M = 5.14 years, SD = 1.17) for symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screening (CATS) in parent rating. The parents' mental health was assessed using the Refugee Health Screener (RHS-15). Furthermore, the child's educators were asked to evaluate the pathological survival states of the child and we made a general assessment of the children's symptoms with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) rated by parents and educators. Children in the refugee sample completed a working memory learning task (Subtest Atlantis from the Kaufmann Assessment Battery for Children, KABC-II) and delivered saliva samples for testing of the cortisol level.
   Results: The parental rating of their child's PTSD symptoms was significantly related to their own mental well-being (r = .50, p < .001). Children with survival states in educator ratings exhibited weaker learning performance (F = 3.49, p < .05) and higher evening cortisol levels (U = 113, z = - 1.7, p < .05, one-tailed).
   Conclusions: Survival states are promising indicators for children's learning performance and distress level complementary to parent rating of child PTSD, which is highly intercorrelated with the parents' own symptom load.

AB  - Many ecological monitoring and assessment programs include rapid assessment methods that employ indicators or metrics to track the degree of divergence of ecosystem condition from reference conditions. Although these rapid assessment methods use a combination of metrics to rate overall ecological condition, they rarely include tests of either the merits of the component metrics being assessed or the method of aggregating the metrics into an overall rating. We used a conceptual model of ecological integrity for wetlands and field data to select and test 15 rapid assessment indicators (using specific metrics) across a spectrum of major ecological factors or MEFs (landscape, buffer, vegetation, hydrology, soil). We applied these metrics to 220 wetland sites across six states (Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Washington), using two assessment area (AA) approaches: 106 sites used 0.5 ha point-based AAs; 114 sites used variable-sized polygon-based AAs. We statistically tested metric ratings and factor scores for their discriminatory power (DP) in relation to a stressor index using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and for redundancy using Spearman rank correlation and scattergrams. Of the 15 metrics, 12 had good or strong DP and were not redundant. Across all metrics, only two pairs (vegetation pair and buffer pair) were strongly correlated. The soil metric had the lowest DP, but it was among the least redundant of any metric. The DP of buffer metrics was lower for point-based approaches than for polygon-based approaches because the buffer for point-based AAs often included additional wetland area. Aggregating individual metrics into MEF scores (e.g., vegetation, hydrology, soil), primary factors scores (Landscape Context, on-site Condition) and overall ecological integrity ratings, either maintained or improved the interpretability of the ratings. Our analyses support the use of 12 rapid field-based metrics, spanning Landscape Context and on-site Condition, to assess the ecological integrity of wetlands. Although tested here for wetlands, the models and metrics are also being applied to upland terrestrial ecosystems. Our findings confirm the merits of our rapid assessment method in providing an intermediate level of assessment that is efficient and ecologically meaningful, within states and across watersheds and regions.

AB  - In this study, three various novel air coolers based on M-Cycle are evaluated using energy and exergy analyses based efficiency assessments along with environmental impact and sustainability parameters. The M-Cycle systems are considered to cool a building room air while their inlet air parameters are same, but outlet cooled air parameters are different. Systems I and III draw electricity directly taken from an electric grid in the building while System II, which is stand alone system, produces and draws electricity from its solar PV panels. In the energy analysis, wet bulb effectiveness, cooling capacity. Coefficient of Performance (energetic COP) and Primary Energy Ratio (PER) are found. In the exergy analysis, exergy input and output rates, exergy loss rate, exergy destruction rate, Exergetic Coefficient of Performance (COPex), Primary Exergy Ratio (PExR) and exergy efficiency are obtained for six different dead state temperatures changing between 10 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Also, sustainability assessments of the systems are obtained using sustainability index (SI) tool for these various dead state temperatures. Finally, environmental assessments of the systems are calculated from their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gCO(2)/kW h) due to their electricity consumptions. Maximum exergy efficiencies and sustainability assessments are found to be 35.13% and 1.5415 for System III and 34.94% and 1.5372 for System II, respectively. GHG emissions of the systems are calculated to be 2119.68 gCO(2)/day, 153.6 gCO(2)/day and 3840 gCO(2)/day for Systems I, II and III respectively. So, System II becomes a good choose to prevent the global warming and to attain sustainable future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Oligocene Menilite Beds (Formation) represent the most important hydrocarbon source rock in the Carpathian Belt. The formation is laterally uniform across long distances but it shows strong internal heterogeneity that reflects changes in depositional environments, which controls the source rock potential. The age of the Menilite Formation in the study area is Lower Oligocene - Rupellian Lower Chattian (nannofossil zone NP22-NP24). Generally, Menilite Beds are dominated by fine-grained (claystone, mudstone, and siltstone) facies, but in some areas they are replaced by thick sandy facies or both types are present. In the study area, both types of facies are present; however, only fine-grained facies have been sedimentologically analysed here because these types can also provide good analytical material for organic geochemistry. The conducted research was aimed at verifying the concepts discussed in the literature that the Menilite Beds were formed in one or more different sedimentary basins, and thus also different palaeogeographic conditions in a small area of the Polish Carpathians, which is located on the border of three tectonic units, precisely in the research area. Therefore, a comparison of these areas was carried out both in terms of facies interpretation and geochemical characteristics. The sedimentological features of 11 different sections of the Menilite Beds from seven localities have been examined: two connected to the Magura Nappe, six to the Dukla Nappe (including tectonic windows) and three to the Silesian Nappe, and total of eight facies (F1 to F8) have been distinguished. Facies F1 from Magura Nappe shows aerobic deposition conditions for sediments with a decisive majority of terrestrial material originating from both angioand gymnosperms, but from Dukla Nappe facies F1 biomarkers indicate a mixed type of marine-terrestrial matter, with a majority of the terrestrial substance and low-oxygen conditions of the sedimentation environment, with an indication of a lacustrine or marine-lacustrine environment, while in Silesian Nappe facies F1 shows marine and typically anoxic features of sedimentation environment. Facies F2, which is presence in all units, characterise a high content of terrestrial-type substance or there is no clear domination of a terrestrial, marine, or lacustrine component. Facies F2 in Magura Nappe has many features in common with facies F1 but differs higher share of angiosperms (high content of terrestrial-type substance), compared to in the Dukla and Silesian units. It does not show clear features or biomarkers that can be unambiguously interpreted to indicate one specific type of sedimentation condition. Facies F3, which was found in the Silesian unit, stands out due to its high deposition environment anoxicity index and a lack of markers proving a share of angiosperms with higher content of algae-type material. The structures found within these facies shows clear lamination, which frequently accompanies algae mats, hence its sedimentation environment may be similar to lacustrine conditions. Facies F4 is present only in the Dukla unit with all its geochemical features and indicates the deltaic and marine shallow water aerobic conditions of its deposition environment, which has a share of organic matter of marine and terrestrial types. Facies F5, which is only present in the Silesian Nappe, originated in an anaerobic environment. A high input of organic matter from freshwater and terrestrial origins, indicated by biomarkers, is consistent with shallow-water deposition.
   Facies F6, present in the Magura Nappe, similar like in Dukla Nappe in most cases stands out due to its low generation potential and high deposition environment aerobicity indices. The origin of organic matter is typically terrestrial originating from angiosperms matter that was deposited probably in lacustrine environment, contrary to the domination of gymnosperms observed in F1 and F2 in the Dukla unit. Stratification of this facies with light and dark colours of fine-grained deposits can indicate cyclically oxidation changes in the sedimentary basin. Generally, biomarker data suggest varied types of organic matter from marine in the Silesian Nappe through mixed in the Dukla Nappe to typically terrestrial in the Magura Nappe which may indicate a deposition in separate basins with their periodical joining. Most of the geochemical parameters indicate also varying redox conditions during deposition in shallow water. Additionally, a variety of the sedimentary structures within accompanying thin-bedded sandstone beds were also recognised. These sedimentary structures provide a possibility to interpret the sedimentary environments of those facies. Most of them are connected to wide-type shallow-water sedimentary environments and are found in the zones between the storm wave base and the fair-weather water wave base (facies F2, F4, F5 and F6). The analysis confirmed the variability of the sedimentation conditions of the Menilite Beds in terms of the deposition conditions, which can also be used to infer the paleogeographic variability of the original deposition areas.

AB  - The State Road Transport Undertakings (SRTUs) are the economic providers of mass transport in India. The institutional constraints imposed on the SRTUs result in low productivity and inefficiency. In this fiercely competitive environment, the state-owned public transport industry cannot operate sustainably, showing mediocre performance. With relatively scarce financial resources, high political expectations, and competition between operators, the efficiency and performance of the industry must be improved by optimizing the available resources. In this study, an integrated analytical hierarchy process-goal programming technique considering both operators' and users' perceptions is used for performance optimization. The methodology starts with the selection of various performance indicators, considering both operators' and users' perceptions. The decision variables are then categorized into user-oriented and operator-oriented. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP), a multicriteria decision-making tool, is then used to evaluate the decision variables and calculate their weights to be used as penalties in goal programming (GP). Pairwise comparison of decision variables on the AHP rating scale was carried out by experts associated with bus transportation and academia. This was used to assign weights to the variables to denote their priority based on their importance. Then, these weights were assigned to the objective function of the GP problem to find a solution that minimizes the weighted sum of deviations from the goal values. As a case study, performance optimization of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation was undertaken. Twelve decision variables were identified, by taking into account both user and operator perceptions, viz. controllable costs, noncontrollable costs, taxes, staff per bus ratio (fleet operated), safety, accessibility, regularity, load factor, fleet utilization, percentage of dead kilometers to effective kilometers, journey speed, and percentage of cancelled kilometers to scheduled kilometers. The perceived importance of each of these decisive factors from both the users' and operators' perspectives was obtained from the experts and prioritized using the AHP. The results indicated that operator cost and staff per schedule were the most important variables for the operators, while safety of travel had the highest weighting according to the users' perceptions. The optimal solution indicated that increasing the accessibility, safety, and regularity would attract passengers to public transport, which would in turn improve the load factor and influence operators to maximize fleet utilization and reduce cancellation of schedules. Moreover, the solution also suggested that decreasing the staff per bus would further reduce the operating cost. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the impact of variations in the decision variables on the performance of the system. The presented method could be used for performance evaluation and optimization of urban rail, metro, and various other public transport systems.

AB  - In a mesocosm experiment, pigment levels, organic matter and the structure of macroinvertebrate community were compared in two linked wetland systems encompassing fish-farm pond and natural reservoir. A stratified sampling design was applied, and treated experimental azoic sediment was placed in suspended boxes. The set of box was used to follow cumulative colonization period and single-month colonization approach for the study of macrofauna and biochemical parameters (organic matter, chlorophyll a and phaeopigments). There were significant differences between systems for the abiotic and community variables and polychaete diversity. Regarding the structure of macroinvertebrate community, the pond system appears to have higher abundance than the natural system. Monthly fluctuation was observed for abiotic variable and community variables in both systems, but polychaete diversity indices did not vary monthly in the pond system, which suggests that diversity indices in disturbed systems do not follow the organic matter variation. The correlation coefficient was also tested within abiotic and community variables for both systems. In the pond system, the organic matter was strongly related with chlorophyll a, carotenoid and phaeopigments. Due to the fact that the source of OM in the pond system is allochthonous, phaeopigments level is likely not to be directly affected by organic matter enrichment, but organic matter inputs create the high primary production and consequently affect the phaeopigments level. Polychaete abundance was positively correlated with the load in organic matter for both reservoir and pond systems, but the correlation coefficient between organic matter and polychaete diversity indices was higher in reservoir than in the pond system. The Moss index was used to indicate the production and degradation state of the systems, and it represented the natural reservoir in a higher production phase than the fish pond, and later on, the monthly variation of the percentage of degradation confirms the pond system in a more decayed state than the natural reservoir system. This study shows that although the organic matter and phaeopigments level tend to be higher in disturbed system, this does not necessarily favor all species, and more sensitive species are endangered of getting displaced by opportunistic species in systems with anthropogenic impact.

AB  - The sustainable management of coastal lagoon hydrosystems is a key issue for the socio-economic and environmental development of many coastal areas worldwide. Often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies, they provide a large range of ecosystem services, from which human societies take advantage. Twenty years after its implementation, a large majority of the Mediterranean lagoons have still not reached the "good status" required by the WFD. Several questions then arise as to the representativeness of the WFD indicators or the relevance of the restoration objectives considering the complexity, evolutionary and unpredictable nature of lagoon hydrosystems. This study proposes an innovative, multidisciplinary, long-term approach to define the proper functioning conditions of a costal lagoon hydrosystems, i.e. all the factors that contribute to the functioning of coastal lagoon hydrosystems and the connectivity with other biodiversity reservoirs, be they ecological, hydrological, social or political. By considering the lagoons and all its hydrological, ecological and societal proper functioning conditions over almost 200 years, this approach makes it possible to assess the influence of past natural and anthropogenic disturbances and support the implementation of future relevant hydrosystem-based management plans which have to be coordinated and politically driven. Defining proper restoration and management objectives should ensure that ecological functions are maintained based on current and future ecosystem benefits and uses. Considering the highly unpredictable nature of coastal hydrosystems, the state of an ecosystem should not only be evaluated on ecological or chemical criteria but also take into account socio-economic and political indicators. The implementation of the 3rd river basin management plan of the WFD as soon as 2022 could be the appropriate occasion to reassess the restoration objectives towards more realistic goals and to give more significance to the definition of the "resilience capacity" of water bodies in place of inappropriate restricted restauration objectives.

AB  - HARRIS, C., H. JIANG, D. LIU, Z. BRIAN, AND K. HE (Department of Biological Sciences, Murray State University, Murray, Kentucky 42071). Testing the roles of species native origin and family membership in intentional plant introductions using nursery data across the state of Kentucky. J. Torrey Bot. Sec. 136: 122-127. 2009.-Biological invasions frequently bring about negative impacts on natural ecosystems, including changing their structure and function and causing loss of biodiversity. A large percentage of invasive species are introduced intentionally as horticulture plants by the green industry. Repeated introductions of non-native plant species have accelerated the invasion processes considerably despite the fact that only a small percentage of intentional introductions actually become invasive. Currently, there is a lack of specific information on non-native and invasive plants in the state of Kentucky, especially concerning species origin, taxonomic affinity, and the pathway of species introduction. This study is designed to gather information about plant species found in nurseries across the state of Kentucky to test the hypothesis that species belonging to certain families and coming from particular geographical regions may have a higher possibility to be introduced into new locations as horticulture plants. By identifying and recording 462 species in 101 families and 258 genera from twenty-two nurseries statewide, we discovered that the possibility for a species to be introduced as horticulture plant significantly relates to its native origin and family membership non-native plant species, especially those with eastern Asian origins, are carried most by nurseries in general. Our results suggest that native origin and family membership of plant species could be used as an effective indicator in identifying the pool of potentially invasive species in the future. Our findings confirm that nurseries have been a major pathway of non-native plants introductions. Most importantly, our study points out the critical needs for having informed and educated personnel in the green industry, so that invasive exotic species will not be introduced in the first place.

AB  - Freshwaters are increasingly exposed to complex mixtures of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) from municipal wastewater, which are known to alter freshwater communities' structure and functioning. However, their interaction with other disturbances and whether their combined effects can impact ecological resilience (i.e., the ability of a system to tolerate disturbances without altering the system's original structure and processes) remain unexplored. Using in situ mesocosms in 2 lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic), we assessed whether a pulse exposure to sublethal concentrations of 12 PPCPs affects the ecological resilience of natural phytoplankton communities that experienced an abrupt environmental change involving the destabilization of the water column through mixing. Such mixing events are predicted to increase as the effects of climate change unfold, leading to more frequent storms, which disrupt stratification in lakes and force communities to restructure. We assessed their combined effects on community metrics (biomass, species richness, and composition) and their relative resilience using 4 indicators (cross-scale, within-scale, aggregation length, and gap length), inferred from phytoplankton communities by discontinuity analysis. The mixing disturbance alone had negligible effects on the community metrics, but when combined with chemical contaminants significant changes were measured: reducing total biomass, species richness, and altered community composition of phytoplankton. Once these changes occurred, they persisted until the end of the experiment (day 20), when the communities' structures from the 2 highest exposure levels diverged from the controls. The resilience indicators were not affected by PPCPs but differed significantly between lakes, with lower resilience found in the eutrophic lake. Thus, PPCPs can significantly alter community structures and reinforce mechanisms that maintain ecosystems in a "degraded state." Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Due to their sensitivity to climate forcing that may alter their abundance and distribution, small pelagic fish are important ecological indicators of the state of the California Current System. They are schooling, planktivorous fish that provide forage for higher trophic levels. We describe the life cycle histories and patterns of distribution of sardine, anchovy, and mackerel species occupying the waters along the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico). The links between the physical and biological forcing and the structure and condition of their habitats, their patterns of movement, productivity, and stock structure (where information is available) are described in relation to the fisheries. We have used the catches as a proxy for the history of the different stocks, while recognizing that fisheries-derived information is biased by the operational scale and only covers areas where fish are available. We have relied mainly on studies of sardines to evaluate the validity of the principal paradigms in fisheries oceanography. We describe how the environment can structure a population by relating an example given by the spatiotemporal variability of the northern and southern stocks of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus) from 2000 to 2014. During this period, the northern stocks showed a marked tendency to contract southwards, as far south as Magdalena Bay, in response to the regional cooling that began in the previous decade. It appears that the combined effects of fishing and climate change may sufficiently alter habitat characteristics so that both the distribution and productivity of a population are shifted.

AB  - Because it can uniquely furnish insights into nonuse values for ecosystem services, survey-based Stated Preference (SP) valuation is widely used to estimate the benefits of ecological restoration. SP surveys ask respondents to select among restoration options yielding different ecological outcomes. This review examines the representation of ecological outcomes in SP studies seeking to quantify values for restoration of aquatic ecosystems. To promote the validity of ecological indicators used in SP valuation, we identified four standards: indicators should be measurable, interpretable, applicable, and comprehensive. We reviewed recent SP studies estimating the value of aquatic ecosystem services to assess whether ecological indicators in current use had these desirable properties. More than half of the 54 indicators reviewed were measurable, meaning referable to potentially precise quantification. About one-third were interpretable, that is, presented in a way that facilitates understanding the effects of restoration. About three quarters of the indicators were applicable; SP valuation practitioners typically consult with natural scientists to ensure that indicators represent the effect of stressors on ecological systems and with focus groups to ensure that indicators have a connection with ecosystem services that contribute to public well-being. While most of the SP studies employed diverse and potentially comprehensive indicators that could capture direct and indirect effects of restoration, and 6 of 20 studies used indicators that met all standards, shortcomings in the indicators were common. These problems can be rectified with attention to how natural scientists measure change and to relationships between restoration outcomes and characteristics of fully restored reference ecosystems.

AB  - The development of strategies to reduce risk to ecosystems has been proposed as a centerpiece for environmental protection. An essential prerequisite to the development of such strategies is the identification and evaluation of those factors (called stressors) which cause stress to ecosystems. Stress refers to external forces which threaten an ecosystem's viability or integrity, that is, the ability to maintain its organizational structure and function. New analytical tools are needed to assist with the difficult task of ecosystem risk assessment. These tools must be sophisticated enough to enable an analyst to do more than focus on single stresser-single assessment endpoint pairs. By an assessment endpoint is meant an environmental value or ecosystem service to be protected or restored. In this paper we develop and describe analytical tools based on the mathematical subdiscipline of graph theory which can be used to gain insights into the interactive relationships which exist among the stressors themselves. The manner in which these stressors are connected to each other and interactive paths among the stressors which tend to augment or diminish the impacts of certain stressors upon the ecosystem can be delineated. When used in conjunction with analytical methods which deal more directly with the impacts of stressors upon the ecosystem itself, the results derived with the aid of these tools can be used to more clearly identify clusters of stressors which should be the focus of environmental protection activities. Applications of these analytical tools to Green Bay, Lake Michigan and the St Croix National Scenic Riverway ecosystems in the United States are discussed. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires European Member States to assess the Ecological Quality Status (EQS) of their water bodies based on Biological Quality Elements (BQEs). A tool called MarMAT (Marine Macroalgae Assessment Tool) was developed to implement the WFD in Portugal, which assesses the EQS of Portugal's coastal intertidal rocky shores. MarMAT is a multimetric method that is compliant with the European WFD requirement. It is based on the composition (Chlorophyta, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyta) and abundance (coverage of opportunists) of marine macroalgae. This study focused on the demands of the WFD to have the assessment methodologies legally accepted by the European Commission. The following factors were examined: (a) the response of MarMAT against anthropogenic pressures; (b) the ability of MarMAT to report all of the five quality classes (bad, poor, moderate, good and high); and (c) the performance of MarMAT, specifically in comparing the RSL (Reduced Species List) methodology with the utility of including the abundance (coverage of opportunists) metric and the necessity of locally adapted reference conditions and boundaries. MarMAT was high inversely correlated (p < 0.001) with anthropogenic pressure. MarMAT also successfully reported all of the quality classes (bad to high) and captured the community changes more accurately when using the coverage of opportunists metric. Because MarMAT satisfactorily covered all of the issues examined, MarMAT may be accepted as a compliant assessment methodology in the scope of the WFD requirements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - So far, the promotion of organic farming through additional premiums, as well as the coupling of direct payments with environmental standards for all agricultural enterprises (cross-compliance), has not been based on scientifically based indicator values. It is proposed that this should be done by means of a cost-benefit-analysis, taking into account both economic and environmental criteria. Economic incentives for conversion to organic fanning and environmentally sound fanning practices should be highest in regions where conventional intensive agriculture causes significant environmental damage without providing significantly higher yield levels than organic farming. In contrast, incentives for conversion should be lower in areas which are not environmentally sensitive, but promote significantly higher yield levels under conventional than under organic fanning practices.
   The protection of biotic resources has already been incorporated into the regional planning targets in some German federal states ("Priority areas for nature protection"). Extending this concept to the agricultural sector, "priority areas for organic farming" can be formulated which aim primarily at the protection of abiotic resources.
   The application of this concept has been demonstrated by linking scientific data from test farms under different soil, climatic and management conditions with statistical data on soil fertility, livestock density and land use within the entire state. It could be demonstrated that a conversion of specialized dairy farms on sandy soils from highly intensive conventional practices to organic standards significantly reduced nitrate inputs into groundwater with only a slight reduction in forage yields. In contrast, nitrate leaching in both conventional and organic arable farming was low on loamy soils which are predestined for arable crop production. but grain yields were by far lower in organic farming.

AB  - Currently, the influence of transportation and its impact on environmental indicators throughout the world are increasing; however, governments of particular countries try to implement new economic instruments with the expectations of changing people's behaviour or at least environmental parameters of the motor vehicle fleet. The Government of the Czech Republic introduced a new economic instrument, which came into force on 1 January 2009 and was inspired by similar environmental taxes in Member States of the European Union - the car registration fee, which is based on emission parameters of cars. The main target of this fee has been to change the structure of the passenger car fleet in the Czech Republic, particularly to support new registrations of new passenger cars with better environmental characteristics and to decrease the share of new registrations of used passenger cars. This article focuses on an ex-post analysis of impacts of the car registration fee on the structure of the passenger car fleet in the Czech Republic and its environmental characteristics in the first 3 years after the legal mandate of the fee. The case study is based on a correlation analysis and an analysis of statistical data from official sources in the Czech Republic. The impacts of the car registration fee on both the structure of the passenger car fleet in the Czech Republic and the environmental characteristics of new registrations are significant. For the first time since 2004, the number of new registrations of new cars was higher in the period 2009-2011 than the number of new registrations of used cars. Moreover, the share of alternative fuel cars in the passenger car market is increasing and the emissions from private car transport are decreasing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The management of biodiversity is of utmost importance for environmental sustainability and conservation. Microalgal diversity/assemblage serves as the biological indicators of water bodies' environment. In the present study, water samples were collected from ten rivers, three lakes and a stream within Doon valley of Western Himalayas, India. This is the first complete and holistic study of microalgal diversity of Doon valley. Different physico-chemical parameters of the water samples like pH, temperature, turbidity, odour and colour were studied. Microalgal diversity was evaluated to serve as bioindicators of the natural riverine and lacustrine habitats. In addition, ArcGIS software tool was applied to create prediction maps for depicting the physico-chemical characteristics of water samples and microalgal diversity. A geostatistical analysis was devised to make these prediction maps. Further, the microalgal diversity was confirmed using PAST tool through diversity indices. The study confirmed the microalgal biodiversity with Shannon (2.59-2.76) and Simpson's (0.91-0.93) indices. The microalgal diversity has been also confirmed with the parametric data (pH, temperature, turbidity) and non-parametric data (colour, odour) of collected water samples. The study recorded a total of 33 taxa belonging to 27 genera of microalgae. The microalgal species found in the lentic and lotic habitats belonged to the Chlorophyta, Myxophyta, Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta and Dinophyta divisions. Three microalgal species belonging to Chlorophyta division were newly reported for Doon valley. Multivariate cluster analysis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling and canonical correspondence analysis were appropriately employed to correlate the microalgal diversity with sampling sites and environmental variables. Further, microalgal diversity data was collated and used as specific indicators for pollution status of the sampled sites. Algal Genus Pollution Index (bearing algal indicator genus) has been employed to assess the organic pollution status of the water bodies. The results indicated rivers Rispana and Bindal as the most organically polluted while River Nun as the least polluted among all the lentic and lotic water bodies of Doon valley.

AB  - Background: Genetic material extracted from in situ microbial communities has high promise as an indicator of biological system status. However, the challenge is to access genomic information from all organisms at the population or community scale to monitor the biosystem's state. Hence, there is a need for a better diagnostic tool that provides a holistic view of a biosystem's genomic status. Here, we introduce an in vitro methodology for genomic pattern classification of biological samples that taps large amounts of genetic information from all genes present and uses that information to detect changes in genomic patterns and classify them.
   Results: We developed a biosensing protocol, termed Biological Memory, that has in vitro computational capabilities to "learn" and "store" genomic sequence information directly from genomic samples without knowledge of their explicit sequences, and that discovers differences in vitro between previously unknown inputs and learned memory molecules. The Memory protocol was designed and optimized based upon (1) common in vitro recombinant DNA operations using 20-base random probes, including polymerization, nuclease digestion, and magnetic bead separation, to capture a snapshot of the genomic state of a biological sample as a DNA memory and (2) the thermal stability of DNA duplexes between new input and the memory to detect similarities and differences. For efficient read out, a microarray was used as an output method. When the microarray-based Memory protocol was implemented to test its capability and sensitivity using genomic DNA from two model bacterial strains, i.e., Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis, results indicate that the Memory protocol can "learn" input DNA, "recall" similar DNA, differentiate between dissimilar DNA, and detect relatively small concentration differences in samples.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated not only the in vitro information processing capabilities of DNA, but also its promise as a genomic pattern classifier that could access information from all organisms in a biological system without explicit genomic information. The Memory protocol has high potential for many applications, including in situ biomonitoring of ecosystems, screening for diseases, biosensing of pathological features in water and food supplies, and non-biological information processing of memory devices, among many.

AB  - The modelling of forest ecosystems is a broad scientific field, encompassing species distribution, dynamic forest succession, growth and disturbance, and biogeochemical cycles. Soil information is frequently required for a holistic and spatially explicit modelling approach. Information on soil properties at sufficient resolution to be incorporated in spatially distributed models is rare however, in particular for mountain forest areas that are poorly accessible and where the required sampling effort is high. In order to bridge this gap, we aim to develop a concept for predicting spatially continuous forest soil properties in mountain areas and substantiate it by comparing different statistical approaches to digital soil mapping, namely Random Forests and Generalized Additive Models. Therefore, we used field descriptions of 1653 legacy soil profiles from a forest area of 5130 km(2) in Tyrol and modelled a variety of soil properties that are essential for the characterisation of forest sites with respect to tree growth. A set of 23 spatially explicit predictor variables, grouped according to geological substrate information, topography, climate, biotic variables, and time-space, were included in the concept and tested. There was a special focus on the predictive relevance of the newly developed geological substrate information, which includes lithogenetic units, lithological composition, and the multilayering of sediments. As a physical soil property, it was possible to predict the plant-available water storage capacity with a significant degree of accuracy, with r(2) = 0.49-0.56, while for the biologically driven state variable organic humus layer thickness, r(2) = 0.22-0.27 was achieved. For describing soil reaction, Ellenberg's indicator value of vegetation turned out to be a suitable proxy for soil pH value, and was modelled with a high degree of predictive power with r(2) = 0.75-0.77. All model results were verified by different evaluation methods, ranging from cross-validation to comparison with independent datasets, tests for spatial autocorrelation, and considering ecological soundness in variable selection. We were able to show that in addition to variables derived from Digital Terrain Models and climate information, the new type of detailed geological substrate information is the most relevant predictor and is promising for digital soil mapping in mountain areas. This finding was independent of the applied statistical approaches and both Generalized Additive Models and Random Forests showed comparable accuracy and proved to be appropriate for these tasks. In addition, we were able to support the modelling results by interpreting the predictors' mode of action with regard to the underlying processes controlling soil properties.

AB  - Scale-related assessment strategies are important contributions to successful ecosystem management. With varying impact of environmental drivers from local to regional scales, a focal task is to understand scale-dependent responses when assessing the state of an ecosystem. In this study we use large-scale monitoring data, spanning 40 years and including four aquatic bioindicator groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, periphyton, zoobenthos) to expose the long-term changes of water quality across Russia. We include four hierarchical spatial scales (region, basin, waterbody and observation point) to identify the relative importance of different spatiotemporal scales for the variation of each bioindicator and patterns of co-variation among the bioindicators at different hierarchical levels. We analysed the data with Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC), an approach that belongs to the framework of joint species distribution models. We performed a cross validation to reveal the predictive power of modelled bioindicator variation, partitioned explained variance among the fixed effects (waterbody type, and influence of human population density) and the random effects (spatial and spatio-temporal variation at the four hierarchical scales), and examined the co-variation among bioindicators at each spatio-temporal scale. We detected generally decreasing water quality across Russian freshwaters, yet with region and bioindicator specific trends. For all bioindicators, the dominating part of the variation was attributed the largest (region) and smallest (observation point) hierarchical scales, the region particularly important for benthic and the observation point for pelagic bioindicators. All bioindicators captured the same spatial variation in water quality at the smallest scale of observation point, with phytoplankton, zooplankton and periphyton being associated positively to each other and negatively to zoobenthos. However, at larger spatial scales and at spatio-temporal scales, the associations among the bioindicators became more complex, with phytoplankton and zooplankton showing opposite trends over time. Our study reveals the sensitivity of bioindicators to spatial and temporal scales. While delivering unidirectional robust water quality assessments at the local scale, bioindicator co-variation is more complex over larger geographic scales and over time.

AB  - Comprehensive late June surveys have for decades been carried out on the Faroe shelf in order to estimate the abundance of juvenile fish - the 0-group. The abundance of cod juveniles has previously been used in recruitment studies, while the ecological implication of the 0-groups has hitherto received less attention. Here we examined the pelagic 0-group stage in four of the main fish species on the Faroe shelf: cod, haddock, Norway pout and sandeel, representing more than 90% of all juvenile fish on the shelf. A positive relationship between length and abundance at the 0-group stage is observed for all juveniles, and the inter-annual variability was highly similar among the four fish species. Based on this knowledge, we produced a new ecological indicator for the central Faroe shelf ecosystem - the 0-group length index. The 0-group length index is characterized by marked peaks in 1984, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2009, and 2017, which appear to be related to the shelf primary production from spring to mid-summer, and possibly to the marine climate surrounding the Faroe shelf. There is a better temporal overlap between the fish larvae and their prey (i.e., small- to medium sized zooplankton) in years with an early and intensive bloom, while late and/or weak blooms lead to unfavorable feeding conditions. We furthermore show that a large abundance of 0-group fish has the potential to graze down and thus regulate the biomass of large-sized zooplankton during late June. In addition to this top-down influence the 0-group fish clearly impact commercial fish stocks and seabird colonies, and our 0-group length index is therefore a key ecological indicator for the state of the entire central Faroe shelf ecosystem.

AB  - Introducing maize germplasm into a particular environment can increase existing genetic diversity, but this can cause phenological and morphological changes as a consequence of its inability to adapt; agronomically, this may be undesirable. The objective of this work was to determine the phenological and morphological changes in maize from different ecological regions of the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, in environments that contrast in altitude, latitude and temperature. Four groups of native populations from Tamaulipas and two groups of improved materials were evaluated in Tropical dry, Transition, and High Valley environments. The variables studied for phenology were days to masculine and feminine flowering, floral asynchrony, and length of internodes; and for morphology the variables were plant height, number of leaves, potential grains, rows per ear, grains per row, total grains and individual grain weight. The groups of Tamaulipas populations exhibited high variability and interaction with the environment for the studied variables; besides, in Tropical dry climate they were significantly different (p <= 0.05) from those in Transition and High Valley climates. The group of populations from the mountainous environment of Tamaulipas had phenological and morphological behavior similar to that of the group of improved maize from the Central High Valleys of Mexico in Transition and High Valley environments. The groups from low altitude areas of Tamaulipas were later and asynchronic; plants were taller and had more leaves. The variables days to masculine and feminine flowering, internode length, total grains per car, total number of leaves, and plant height showed significant differences among the environments evaluated; therefore they could be considered indicators of response to environmental effects on introduced populations.

AB  - Nearly thirty years ago the U.S. EPA directed states to begin developing water quality standards specific to wetlands; however, progress has been limited. This study presents an overview of ambient wetland water quality and the first step towards the development of numeric nutrient standards for forested wetlands in North Carolina. Water quality samples were collected in 16 natural wetlands across the state for three years. The sites span a range of anthropogenic disturbance. The data was combined with historical data collected at these and other sites from 2005 to 2013. Concentration levels in wetlands without significant anthropogenic disturbance are likely higher than streams for TN, TP, similar for NH4+, and likely lower than streams for NO3--N. A method developed by the U.S. EPA to establish reference levels was modified to define draft nutrient warning levels that may indicate anthropogenic impacts. These warning levels were calculated as 0.06 mg/L, 0.14 mg/L, 0.34 mg/L and 2.8 mg/L for NO3--N, NH4+-N, TP and TN, respectively. NO3--N and NH4+-N concentrations were the best indicators of disturbance. Overall, despite the limitations imposed by the sampling frequency and inherent variability in wetland ecosystems, this research methodology presents a reasonable first attempt at defining nutrient warning levels for undisturbed natural forested wetlands in N.C., and may serve as a starting point in developing numeric nutrient criteria for wetlands.

AB  - Multiple recreational seawater pollution episodes affected the coasts of Campania region (Southern Italy) during the 2019 summer season (May through September). The region's population detected evidence of this pollution by a change in the water colour (to green-brown). This pollution was only partially revealed by conventional monitoring and standardized indicators performed by the Campania Region Environmental Protection Agency (ARPAC). Starting with this evidence, a multidisciplinary team that included representatives from both Italian and United States universities, the Regional Environmental Protection Agency, and the Italian Coast Guard, studied the phenomenon and found all three actors of the environmental model source-path-target. The research was performed using the Multi-level and Multi-parametric monitoring (MUM3) framework, following a bottom-up approach, comprising both onsite and remote sampled and sensed data, that begins at the surface level and scales up to determine the extent as well as the source of the pollution. By this approach, the presence of a microalgae bloom (Pyramimonas spp. and Euglena spp.) has been disclosed and it has been related to the higher amount of nutrients loading by river inflows, due to the precipitation anomalies occurred in May 2019 in that site. This study represents the first application of a real testbed of the MUM3 framework that follows a bottom-up approach showing the added value of this multi-scale and multiparameter methodology for environmental monitoring and assessment, where conventional methods often fail.

AB  - The crucial issue of modern age is creation and maintenance of an ecologically friendly environment in urban areas. One of the ways of its solution is adaptive selection of tree and shrub species (both natives and exotic) used for green construction. The performance of this work depends on the application of scientific knowledge about the ecological and physiological state of each species. This determines the need for assessment of adaptive capacity of the speciess used for greening. An important role in the formation and development of trees and shrubs, including members of the spruce (Picea A. Dietr.) genus, plays the content of reserve nutrients in the tissues. A sufficient number of them promotes active growth and development of the shoot, rooting of cuttings and resistance to unfavorable external factors. The research subjects were two species of the spruce (Picea A. Dietr.) genus: indigenous species - Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) and introduced species - blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm). The starch content in the cells of annual shoot tissues was revealed by qualitative reaction solution (Lugol's iodine); fats were recorded with Sudan III. After staining with appropriate reagents and fixation, cuts were analyzed with a microscope. The assessment of the reserve substances content was given on the cross-section of the scion for each accounting area separately and in the total score for all accounting areas using the 6-point scale we proposed. It was found that the cells of blue spruce tissues contain more reserve substances than the cells of Norway spruce tissues on all accounting dates. The significance of these differences was confirmed by the two-way analysis of variance. The inertia of photosynthesis with a change in temperature is noted. The fat content may be an indicator of the status of a plant and its readiness for the growing season or to transition into resting state. The data obtained allow optimizing the work in the nurseries and rooting of cuttings more effectively.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influences of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions on hazardousness and photochemical reactivity and to propose efficient VOCs abatement strategies.
   Methods The atmospheric concentrations of 101 components of VOCs were measured at six sites which comprehend four urban areas, a roadside area, and an industrial area in Hyogo Prefecture. VOCs influence on hazardousness and photochemical reactivity were evaluated using VOCs measured data and the index on the health effect evaluation and ozone formation potential. The substances that require emissions reduction were selected from the evaluation results. The state and characteristics of environmental pollution were considered from the concentration trends of the selected substances.
   Results In industrial area, n-hexadecane, styrene, vinyl chloride monomer, and 1,2-dichloroethane showed a high concentration. In roadside area, n-hexane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, tetrachloroethylene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 1-butanol showed a high concentration. The excess cancer incidences for formaldehyde exceeded 10(-5) of the level of concern for carcinogenic effect at all sites. Toluene had a high percentage of ozone production. The interannual and seasonal trends of toluene concentrations were different at a regional level and the formaldehyde concentrations in summer were significantly higher than those in winter at the urban sites.
   Conclusions The results show the need to prepare the emission reduction plan for the major sources such as vehicle exhaust, solvent use, and industrial processes to diminish the concentration of toluene that contributes significantly to the formation of photochemical oxidant.

AB  - Background The Aegadian Islands are located west of Trapani, Sicily. Once the site of bountiful tuna fisheries and fruit orchards (plums, peaches, apricots), grapevines, prickly pears, and grains, the local economy is now based on tourism, and many traditional agricultural and maritime practices have been abandoned. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the state of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) concerning the use of wild and cultivated plants and fungi for human health, food, maritime, and agricultural purposes on the islands of Levanzo, Favignana, and Marettimo and compare present-day practices with those documented in the past. Methods In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted in Italian with 48 participants with prior informed consent from May 2016 to July 2017 and October 2018. Herbarium voucher specimens of wild species were collected for herbarium deposit. A rigorous literature review of scientific and other local reports on TEK of wild flora and their application in food, health, and household applications was undertaken for the purpose of comparing findings from this field study with prior reports. Results A total of 122 plant and five fungal taxa representing 54 families were cited for 355 uses. Among the most pervasive species in the landscape, Agave americana and A. sisalana had diverse applications in the past, which ranged from cordage for agricultural and maritime applications to tools for sewing, eating land snails, and constructing furniture. Fields of Ferula communis also dominate the landscape, and the dry stems were used extensively in furniture making; this species also serves as an environmental indicator for the location of the most preferred edible mushrooms, Pleurotus eryngii var. ferulae. Other important flora included topical medicinal applications of Glaucium flavum for hematomas and Artemisia arborescens for ritual bathing of newborns. Conclusion While many plant-based traditions have disappeared from daily practice, especially those related to traditional fishing and health practices, they remain in the memories of the eldest subset of the population. Documenting this knowledge before it disappears from oral history is a key factor in reducing loss of TEK and biocultural diversity, safeguarding the role of the Aegadian Islands as biocultural refugia.

AB  - Significant land-use changes have occurred in Western European rural regions since the 1950s, leading to standardisation of the landscape, and to the decline of the richness in terms of habitat for fauna and flora. This paper reports on a study of the dynamics of a typical landscape for these regions (North-Western part of Switzerland) at five periods of time (the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s) and its relation with the decrease of the population of the brown hare (Lepus europaeus). The socio-economical, ecological, climatic and geomorphologic states of 936 communes were described with 40 variables, obtained mostly from communal statistics, using a Geographical Information System (MapInfo). An Index of the Abundance of Hares (IAH) was calculated on 125 of these communes. Statistical analyses and PEGASE (a multivariate hierarchical divisive analysis method) were performed, using IAH as target variable, to identify the key-variables of the landscape for the hare. On basis of these key-variables, two scenarios for the future were constructed, leading both to negative consequences for the hare. Our procedure for analysing the landscape dynamics in relation to the population of brown hare proves to be original and useful. The result is a base of discussion for building a platform for the monitoring of the landscape and its capacity to be a suitable habitat for an animal. The brown hare was shown to be an appropriate part of a set of indicators to measure the intensification of the agriculture, the extension of urbanisation and the development of the road and rail networks.

AB  - Slow changes in underlying state variables can lead to "tipping points," rapid transitions between alternative states ("regime shifts") in a wide range of complex systems. Tipping points and regime shifts routinely are documented retrospectively in long time series of observational data. Experimental induction of tipping points and regime shifts is rare, but could lead to new methods for detecting impending tipping points and forestalling regime shifts. By using controlled additions of detrital organic matter (dried, ground arthropod prey), we experimentally induced a shift from aerobic to anaerobic states in a miniature aquatic ecosystem: the self-contained pools that form in leaves of the carnivorous northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. In unfed controls, the concentration of dissolved oxygen ([O-2]) in all replicates exhibited regular diurnal cycles associated with daytime photosynthesis and nocturnal plant respiration. In low prey-addition treatments, the regular diurnal cycles of [O-2] were disrupted, but a regime shift was not detected. In high prey-addition treatments, the variance of the [O-2] time series increased until the system tipped from an aerobic to an anaerobic state. In these treatments, replicate [O-2] time series predictably crossed a tipping point at similar to 45 h as [O-2] was decoupled from diurnal cycles of photosynthesis and respiration. Increasing organic-matter loading led to predictable changes in [O-2] dynamics, with high loading consistently driving the system past a well-defined tipping point. The Sarracenia microecosystem functions as a tractable experimental system in which to explore the forecasting and management of tipping points and alternative regimes.

AB  - Understanding how biological communities respond to global change is important for the conservation of functioning ecosystems as anthropogenic environmental threats increase. National parks within the United States provide unique ecological and cultural resources that can help conserve biodiversity and maintain ecological integrity, especially in heavily urbanized environments. Parks within the National Capital Region (NCRN) and Mid-Atlantic (MIDN) Networks, representing federally protected areas located within a mixed landscape of rural to urban areas, have been monitoring forest and grassland birds annually to evaluate long-term trends in bird community dynamics. Given increasing rates of decline in forest-and grassland-breeding songbirds in North America, understanding community-level trends in parks will help their preservation for future generations. We used point count data collected between 2007 and 2015 from 640 sampling locations to calculate a bird community index (BCI) to infer relative estimates of ecological integrity. Our objectives were to (1) quantify BCI in 17 national parks in the mid-Atlantic region, (2) test for relationships between BCI and the proportion of forest and developed land cover types, (3) assess temporal variation in BCI, and (4) additionally test for differences in estimates of species detection probability between volunteer citizen scientists and paid observers. Mean BCI scores and ecological integrity ranks among parks ranged between 33.5 (low integrity) and 58.3 (high integrity), while the majority of parks had BCI scores ranging between 40.1 and 52.0 (medium integrity). For both networks, we found that BCI was positively related to the extent of forest cover, and for NCRN, the more heavily urbanized network, we found that BCI was negatively related to developed land cover. Assessment of temporal changes in BCI within parks indicated that BCI was stable for 12 parks, increased in four parks, and decreased in one park within our study. Lastly, we detected no differences in species detection probability between citizen scientist-and paid observer-collected data which lends support for the future comparison of bird monitoring data in regional analyses across NPS I&M Networks. The continued evaluation of ecological integrity, through measuring bird community dynamics at regional scales, is important for conserving biological diversity.

AB  - This study presents a quantitative national assessment of urban water availability and vulnerability for 225 U.S. cities with population greater than 100,000. Here, the urban assessments account for not only renewable water flows, but also the extracted, imported, and stored water that urban systems access through constructed infrastructure. These sources represent important hydraulic components of the urban water supply, yet are typically excluded from water scarcity assessments. Results from this hydraulic-based assessment were compared to those obtained using a more conventional method that estimates scarcity solely based on local renewable flows. The inclusion of hydraulic components increased the mean availability to cities, leading to a significantly lower portion of the total U. S. population considered "at risk" for water scarcity (17%) than that obtained from the runoff method (47%). Water vulnerability was determined based on low-flow conditions, and smaller differences were found for this metric between at-risk populations using the runoff (66%) and hydraulic-based (54%) methods. The large increase in the susceptible population between the scarcity measures evaluated using the hydraulic method may better reconcile the seeming contradiction in the United States between perceptions of natural water abundance and widespread water scarcity. Additionally, urban vulnerability measures developed here were validated using a media text analysis. Vulnerability assessments that included hydraulic components were found to correlate with the frequency of urban water scarcity reports in the popular press while runoff-based measures showed no significant correlation, suggesting that hydraulic-based assessments provide better context for understanding the nature and severity of urban water scarcity issues.

T2  - EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA
LA  - English
AB  - The activity of cellulolytic microorganisms taking part in a conspicuous way in decomposition processes is one of the ecological indicators of the state of the habitat. Grass species of the genus Calamagrostis often spread in thin forests damaged by air pollution and on deforested areas in the Beskydy Mts. The activities of cellulolytic microorganisms in Calamagrostis arundinacea and C. villosa stands as well as in the neighbouring Norway spruce stands, were therefore studied on different habitats in the Beskydy Mts exposed to different levels of air pollution and climatic impact. The activity of cellulolytic microoganisms was determined by means of the standard mesh-bag method. Mesh-bags containing cellulose were exposed on the soil surface and in the soil. During the growing season of 1994, irrespective to the air pollution impact, the activities of cellulolytic microorganisms on the soil surface and at soil depths of 5 cm and 20 cm were 2.5 to 7 times as high in the C. arundinacea stands as in the forests. In C, villosa stands the values on the soil surface and at the soil depth of 5 cm were about two times higher than in forests. In the years of 1994 and 1995, the rate of cellulose decomposition on the soil surface was higher in the stands of the C. arundinacea than in C. villosa stands, i.e., 4.47 to 17.07 and 1.38 to 6.12 mg.g(-1).day(-1), respectively. In both years, higher values of cellulose decomposition rates were recorded in C. arundinacea stands on sites under lower air pollution and climatic impact than in localities at higher altitudes fully exposed to pollution. The activity of cellulolytic microorganisms in C. villosa stands was also higher on sites under lower air pollution and climatic impact in the year of 1995.

AB  - In the last decade, Cambisols of Eastern Siberia and Transbaikalia, in the Ural region, have been actively studied, whereas the data on Cambisols of the mountains of the south of Western Siberia over the last decade of the XXIth century are insufficient and incomplete. However, the study of cambisols, their properties, genesis, diversity and patterns of spatial distribution is still very important. This research is devoted to the study of the Kuznetsk Alatau Cambisols on the basis of modern diagnostic principles of the substantive-genetic classification of Russian soils and WRB. In this paper, there is a brief overview of the history of studying Cambisols in the Kuznetsk Alatau and the surrounding area. An analogue of Cambisols in the Russian classification is Burozems.
   The research was conducted in the territory of Kuznetsk Alatau State Nature Reserve (Kemerovo region) within the mountain-forest and high-altitude zones where Cambisols occupy 67% of the area. Fig. 1B shows the spatial distribution of Cambisols in the studied territory. The parent rocks for the studied soils are brown clays and heavy loams of the Quaternary Period of deluvial and deluvial-proluvial origin. According to chemical composition, the parent rocks are non-carbonate and very rarely low carbonate. Field studies were carried out in 2014-2016. For soil diagnostics, we used the Russian Soil Classification (Shishov LL et al., 2004; Field guide of soils in Russia, 2008) and International Soil Classification WRB. For the analytical characteristics of soils, we selected 10 soil profiles (See Table 1), whose samples were analyzed. The main research methods were comparative-geographical, profile-genetic and comparative-analytical. The indicators of the humus state of soils were estimated according to Grishina and Orlov (1978).
   As a result of the studies, we found out that Burozems (Cambisols) diversity is characterized by two types of soil, nine subtypes, one genus and four species. The types were distinguished by the nature of the surface horizon: Burozem and Burozem raw humic. The subsurface structural-metamorphic (Cambic) horizon and the surface horizon are diagnostic horizons for them: grey humic and raw humic. These types of soils are part of the structural-metamorphic section, which belongs to the postlithogenic order. Burozem and Burozem raw humic correspond to RSG of WRB: Dystric Cambisols and Folic Cambisols, respectively. The following soil subtypes found in the territory of the Kuznetsk Alatau have been allocated: ordinary, eluvial, clay-illuvial, gleyey and darkprofilic (Eutric Cambisols (Profundihumic). It is dedicated to the soil parent material containing weathering products of carbonaceous slates and limestones. These sediments contain lithogenic organic substance which tinctures the soil profile in gray including the structural-metamorphic (Cambic) horizon. This feature distinguishes them from the brown colored subtypes. The regularities of Cambisols distribution across the studied territory have been revealed. Eutric Cambisols formed everywhere within the mountain-taiga zone under the fir forest on the slopes of different exposition. Folic Cambisols are found mainly in the high-mountain region under the tundra vegetation as well as under the fir and cedar pine open woodland. The influence of the soil parent material manifests itself in Eutric Cambisols (Profundihumic), which are attributed to the sediments containing weathering products of carbonaceous shales and limestones. Cambisols are characterized by acidic reaction in the soil horizons. Folic Cambisols are more acidic soils. They are characterized by higher values of hydrolytic and exchangeable acidity and low base saturation. Eutric Cambisols (Profundihumic) have low acidity and high base saturation because of the influence of parent rock bases. Exchangeable acidity in all studied soils was caused by exchangeable aluminum. Pedogenic accumulation of organic carbon in the upper horizons of the soil profile is typical of Cambisols. Humus type is predominantly fulvate. Also, the humus is characterized by low contents of humic and fulvic acids associated with calcium. Eutric Cambisols (Profundihumic) have a high content of nonhydrolyzable residue in humin, which is caused by the lithogenic properties of the organic matter.

AB  - Spatial indicators are used to quantify the state of species and ecosystem status, that is the impacts of climate and anthropogenic changes, as well as to comprehend species ecology. These metrics are thus, determinant to the stakeholder's decisions on the conservation measures to be implemented. A detailed review of the literature (55 papers) showed that 18 spatial indicators were commonly used in marine ecology. Those indicators were than characterized and studied in detail, based on its application to empirical data (a time series of 35 marine species spatial distributions, sampled either with a random stratified survey or a regular transects surveys). The results suggest that the indicators can be grouped into three classes, that summarize the way the individuals occupy space: occupancy (the area occupied by a species), aggregation (spreading or concentration of species biomass) and quantity dependent (indicators correlated with biomass), whether these are spatially explicit (include the geographic coordinates, e.g. center of gravity) or not. Indicator's temporal variability was lower than between species variability and no clear effect was observed in relation to sampling design. Species were then classified accordingly to their indicators. One indicator was selected from each of the three categories of indicators, to represent the main axes of species spatial behavior and to interpret them in terms of occupancy-aggregationquantity relationships. All species considered were then classified according to their relationships among those three axes, into species that under increasing abundancy, primarily increase occupancy or aggregation or both. We suggest to use these relationships along the three-axes as surveillance diagrams to follow the yearly evolution of species distributional patterns in the future.

AB  - Several techniques for the experimental investigation of the computing power of various formal models, from cellular automata to Turing machines, have been proposed by S. Wolfram with his NKS (New Kind of Science). Visual complexity indicators reveal the 'internal shapes' of computations, and may expose constant, periodic, nested/fractal, pseudo-random, and even more sophisticated dynamics.
   In this paper we investigate visual complexity indicators for process algebra. With its emphasis on reactive, continuously observable behavior, as opposed to input/output behavior, process algebra might appear as an ideal candidate for NKS-style investigations; however, this formal model is in some sense more elaborate than the simple fon-nalisms addressed in NKS, and poses specific problems, such as the presence of both events and states, and the explosive nature of non-determinism.
   We consider a set of process algebraic operators and prove its Turing universality by showing that they can emulate any elementary cellular automaton, including n. 110, which is itself universal. The correctness of the emulation is supported by an original visual indicator, which is then used for exploring various subclasses of algebraic expressions and their emergent features. Based on this indicator, and even by restricting to deterministic computations, we have detected and measured, by a data compression technique, the emergence of randomness in a subclass of expressions which is provably not universal.
   Besides providing a suggestive visualization of the relative strengths of operator subsets, we believe that results of this type, both of theoretical and of experimental nature, are desirable in light of one of the key NKS conjectures, according to which random-like behavior would be a witness of computational universality.

AB  - The one- and two-electron-reduction reactions of menadione result in the generation of reactive oxygen species which are believed to mediate the cytotoxicity of this xenobiotic. The induction of lipid peroxidation in liver and isolated hepatocytes occurs in response to the menadione-mediated formation of reactive oxygen species. However, studies on the effects of menadione on the urinary excretion of lipid metabolites have not been conducted. The effect of a single oral dose of 60 mg menadione/kg to rats on the urinary excretion of the lipid metabolites malondialdehyde (MDA), formaldehyde (FA), acetaldehyde (ACT), and acetone (ACON) has been examined over 48 h post-treatment. The urinary metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Time-dependent increases in the urinary excretion of the four metabolites were observed after menadione administration. Over the 48 h of the study, the menadione-induced urinary excretion of MDA, FA, ACT, and ACON increased by approximately 1.5-, 2.0-, 1.7-, and 3.2-fold, respectively, relative to control animals. The data were expressed in nmoles/kg body weight/4.5 h. The results clearly demonstrate that menadione increases the urinary excretion of four lipid metabolites. These metabolites may have widespread applicability as biomarkers of altered lipid metabolism in disease states and exposure to environmental pollutants/xenobiotics which induce enhanced lipid peroxidation. The non-invasive methods offer advantages over most other methods for assessing oxidative stress in vivo.

AB  - Thyroid hormones (TH), thyroxine (T-4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T-3), play crucial roles in regulation of growth, development and metabolism in vertebrates and their actions are targets for endocrine disruptive agents. Perturbations in TH action can contribute to the development of disease states and the US Environmental Protection Agency is developing a high throughput screen using TH-dependent amphibian metamorphosis as an assay platform. Currently this methodology relies on external morphological endpoints and changes in central thyroid axis parameters. However, exposure-related changes in gene expression in TH-sensitive tissue types that occur over shorter time frames have the potential to augment this screen. This study aims to characterize and identify molecular markers in the tadpole brain. Using a combination of cDNA array analysis and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), we examine the brain of tadpoles following 96 h of continuous exposure to T-3, T-4, methimazole, propylthiouracil, or perchlorate. This tissue was more sensitive to T-4 rather than T-3, even when differences in biological activity were taken into account. This implies that a simple conversion of T-4 to T-3 cannot fully account for T-4 effects on the brain and suggests distinctive mechanisms of action for the two THs. While the brain shows gene expression alterations for methimazole and propylthiouracil, the environmental contaminant, perchlorate, had the greatest effect on the levels of mRNAs encoding proteins important in neural development and function. Our data identify gene expression profiles that can serve as exposure indicators of these chemicals. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of dynamic economic development of the Arctic, one of the strategic tasks is to ensure environmental safety and preserve the conditions and quality of life of the local population. It is possible to solve this problem by conducting environmental impact assessment (EIA) at the stage of economic activity planning, which is mandatory in all Arctic countries. During the EIA process, companies assess possible environmental and related social and economic impact of the planned investment project. For this purpose, appropriate techniques are used, and their number is sufficient to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the impact on the natural environment. At the same time, assessing social impact of economic initiatives is quite a challenge for companies due to the fact that Russia lacks the documents and methodological recommendations that regulate the implementation of such an assessment. This fact is confirmed by the practice of EIA and by scientific research, according to which the assessment of social impact of economic activity is one of the most difficult and least studied issues in modern science. It becomes particularly important to find a solution to this problem for the Russian Arctic, where the indigenous population lives, whose conditions and quality of life largely depend on the state of the environment and preservation of traditional economic activities. In this regard, we set a goal to find an approach to the development of a methodology for forecasting social changes for the Arctic region of Russia. To achieve the goal, we do the following 1) we analyze the existing methodological approaches to assessing the social impact of the planned economic activity in the context of Russian and foreign research, as well as the practice of EIA; 2) we describe a system of indicators of the social environment of the Russian Arctic; 3) we build a matrix of social impact of the planned economic activity. The findings of our study can become the basis for the development of specific techniques, including sectoral methods, to assess social impact of the planned economic activity; these techniques can be used for a comprehensive environmental assessment of the planned economic activity by public and private companies.

AB  - Algal blooms can have profound effects on the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems and have the potential to interrupt valuable ecosystem services. Despite the potential ecological and economic consequences of algal blooms, the spatial dynamics of bloom development in spatially complex ecosystems such as shallow lakes remain poorly characterised. Our goal was to evaluate the magnitude and drivers of spatial variability of algal biomass, dissolved oxygen, and pH over the course of a season, in a shallow lake in order to better understand the spatial dynamics of algal blooms in these ecosystems. We sampled 98 locations in a small eutrophic lake on a 65-m grid for several parameters (chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature), weekly over 122 days. This was done to estimate the dynamics of variability and spatial autocorrelation during the course of multiple bloom events. We also compared the spatial measurements to a high frequency sensor deployed at a fixed station and estimated the optimal spatial sampling resolution by performing a rarefaction analysis. Spatial heterogeneity of algal pigments was high, particularly during bloom events, and this pattern and the overall severity of the bloom were not well captured with the fixed station monitoring. The pattern of algal pigments and other limnologically important variables (dissolved oxygen and pH) was related to the direction of prevailing winds 24 hr prior to sampling, the shallow northern basin where the main surface inlet is located, and heavy precipitation. Additionally, a dense bed of floating-leaf macrophytes contributed to local patchiness in all variables. Finally, from the rarefaction analysis we found that minimal information about the mean state of the ecosystem was gained after c. 30 locations had been sampled. This study revealed how spatially heterogeneous shallow lakes are over the course of a single season, and that the magnitude of variability was highest during biologically intensive periods such as algal blooms. As such, continued research is needed across a range of trophic conditions to better understand the structure of horizontal variability in lakes. Overall, these data demonstrate the need for spatially explicit monitoring to better understand the dynamics and drivers of algal blooms in shallow lakes and to better manage ecosystem services.

AB  - Agroforestry offers proven strategies as an environmentally benign and ecologically sustainable land management practice to promote ecosystem services. In this literature review, we systematically consider the agroforestry and ecosystem services literature with the aim to identify and catalogue the knowledge field and provide the first systematic synthesis of ecosystem services research in relation to European agroforestry. We reviewed 71 scientific publications from studies conducted in farmland and forest ecosystems with various types of agroforestry management. Each publication was systematically characterized and classified by agroforestry practice and research approach in order to provide an insight into the current research state in addressing ecosystem services (including methods, indicators, and approaches). Spatial distribution of the case study sites in Europe was also explored. In addition, typical clusters of similar research approaches were identified.
   The results show that ecosystem service assessment of European agroforestry is currently focused on the spatially extensive wood pastures in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Continental agricultural mosaic landscapes. A specific emphasis has been on regulating, supporting, and provisioning services, such as provision of habitat and biodiversity, food, climate regulation, fibre, and fuel, and the consideration of cultural services has been largely limited to aesthetic value. There is a bias to biophysical and monetary research approaches. The majority of the studies focus on quantitative methods and biophysical field measurements addressing the assessment of only one or two services. Monetary approaches have been applied in less than one fifth of the studies but form a distinctive group.
   Our results highlight gaps and biases in the ecosystem service research agenda within agroforestry based on which we conclude that research should aim to diversify from the biophysical and monetary approaches, towards a wider variety of approaches, especially socio-cultural, and a wider coverage of ecosystem services, Stronger consideration of stakeholder participation and introduction of spatially explicit mapping are also important key actions. We make suggestions to advance the promise of ecosystem services provision from European agroforestry in decision making including various actors, stakeholders, and institutions, with strong links to policy processes, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy and Common Agricultural Policy.

AB  - The low efficiency of renewable electricity storage has been considered as a bottleneck of the scalable and low-carbon Power-to-Gas energy transformation concept. This paper investigates the combination of CO2 biofixation using Spirulina platensis microalgae and catalytic hydrothermal gasification of wet organic feedstock for the storage of fluctuating electricity and direct utilisation of waste CO2. The presented method enables wet microalgae biomass conversion into H and C-1-C-2 rich fuel gas stream using hydrothermal conversion that is valorised further to methane. For bridging the gap between theoretical investigations and the application of this approach, experiments were carried out at elevated temperatures (632.9-717.0 degrees C) based on a central composite design of the experiment. Biogas upgrading was evaluated by ASPEN Plus flowsheeting software. The results show that the proposed storage cycle outperforms the state-of-the-art biological and chemical-based Sabatier methanations with an overall round-trip efficiency of 42.3%. The optimised thermo-chemical process enables to achieve simultaneously high H-2 (9.05 mol kg(-1)) and CH4 (7.91 mol kg(-1)) yields with an enhanced 71.23% carbon conversion ratio. Moreover, the environmental and cost evaluations of the currently proposed bio-synthetic process indicate low associated CO2 equivalent emission (99.4 +/- 12.6 g CO2,eq kWh(-1)) with 144.9 (sic)MWh(-1) normalised total annual natural gas production cost. Ideally the proposed storage cycle requires less H-2 from external sources, effective CO2 utilisation becomes available through the biofixation and hydrothermal conversion of the wet organic feedstock and closed carbon emission cycle can be accomplished.

AB  - Maryland Department of Natural Resources is conducting the Maryland Biological Stream Survey, a probability-based sampling program, stratified by river basin and stream order, to assess water quality, physical habitat, and biological conditions in first through third order, non-tidal streams. These streams comprise about 90% of all lotic water miles in the state. About 300 sites (75 m segments) are being sampled during spring and summer each year. All basins in the stare will be sampled over a three-year period, 1995-97. MESS developments in 1995-96 included (1) an electrofishing capture efficiency correction method to improve the accuracy of fish population estimates, (2) two indices of biotic integrity (IBI) for fish assemblages to identify degraded streams, and (3) land use information for catchments upstream of sampled sites to investigate associations between stream condition and anthropogenic stresses. Based on fish IBI scores at 270 stream sites in six basins sampled in 1995, 11% of non-tidal stream miles in Maryland were classified as very poor, 15% as poor, 24% as fair, and 27% as good. IBIs have not yet been developed for stream sites with catchment areas less than 120 hectares (23% of non-tidal stream miles). IBI scores declined with stream acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and pH, an association that was also evident for fish species richness, biomass, and density. Low IBI scores were associated with several measures of degraded stream habitat, but not with local riparian buffer width. There was a significant negative association between IBI scores and urban land use upstream of sampled sites in the only extensively urbanized basin assessed in 1995. Future plans for the MESS include (I) identifying all benthic macroinvertebrate samples to genus, (2) developing benthic macroinvertebrate, herpetofaunal, and physical habitat indicators, and (3) enhancing the analysis of stream condition-stressor associations by refining landscape metrics and using multi-variate techniques.

AB  - Conservation goals at the start of the 21st century reflect a combination of contrasting ideas. Ideal nature is something that is historically intact but also futuristically flexible. Ideal nature is independent from humans, but also, because of the pervasiveness of human impacts, only able to reach expression through human management. These tensions emerge in current management rationales because scientists and managers are struggling to accommodate old and new scientific and cultural thinking, while also maintaining legal mandates from the past and commitments to preservation of individual species in particular places under the stresses of global change. Common management goals (such as integrity, wilderness, resilience), whether they are forward looking and focused on sustainability and change, or backward looking and focused on the persistence and restoration of historic states, tend to create essentialisms about how ecosystems should be. These essentialisms limit the options of managers to accommodate the dynamic, and often novel, response of ecosystems to global change. Essentialisms emerge because there is a tight conceptual coupling of place and historical species composition as an indicator of naturalness (e.g., normal, healthy, independent from humans). Given that change is increasingly the norm and ecosystems evolve in response, the focus on idealized ecosystem states is increasingly unwise and unattainable. To provide more open-ended goals, we propose greater attention be paid to the characteristics of management intervention. We suggest that the way we interact with other species in management and the extent to which those interactions reflect the interactions among other biotic organisms, and also reflect our conservation virtues (e.g., humility, respect), influences our ability to cultivate naturalness on the landscape. We call this goal a natural practice (NP) and propose it as a framework for prioritizing and formulating how, when, and where to intervene in this period of rapid change. Desarrollo de una Practica Natural para Adaptar Objetivos de Conservacion al Cambio Global
   Resumen Los objetivos de conservacion al inicio del siglo XXI reflejan una combinacion de ideas contrastantes. La naturaleza ideal es algo que esta intacto historicamente y que es flexible futuristicamente. La naturaleza ideal es independiente del humano, pero por causa de la dominacion del impacto humano, solo puede expresarse por medio del manejo humano. Estas tensiones emergen en el actual razonamiento de manejo porque los cientificos y los administradores luchan por acomodar el pensamiento cientifico y cultural viejo y nuevo bajo el estres del cambio global, mientras mantienen los mandatos legales del pasado y los compromisos de preservacion de especies individuales en lugares particulares. Los objetivos comunes de manejo (como la integridad, lo silvestre del terreno, la capacidad de recuperacion), ya sea que miren hacia el frente y esten enfocados en la sustentabilidad y el cambio, o miren hacia atras y esten enfocados en la persistencia y restauracion de los estados historicos, tienden a crear esencialismos sobre como deben ser los ecosistemas que limitan las opciones de los administradores para acomodar la respuesta dinamica, y comunmente novedosa, de los ecosistemas hacia el cambio global. Esto es porque hay un emparejamiento conceptual entre el lugar y la composicion historica de especies como indicador de la naturalidad (p. ej.: normal, sana, independiente del humano) que esta grabado en las metas. Dado que el cambio es cada vez m ' s la norma y los ecosistemas evolucionan en respuesta, el enfoque sobre los estados idealizados de los ecosistemas es imprudente e inalcanzable. Para proporcionar mas objetivos sin restricciones, proponemos que se ponga mayor atencion a las caracteristicas de la intervencion del manejo. Sugerimos que el modo en el que interactuamos con otras especies en el manejo y la extension a la cual esas interacciones son similares a las interacciones de otros organismos bioticos y como reflejan nuestras virtudes de conservacion (p. ej.: humildad, respeto) influye sobre nuestra habilidad para cultivar la naturalidad en el paisaje. A esto lo llamamos practica natural y sugerimos que puede contribuir a un marco de trabajo para priorizar y formular, como, cuando y donde intervenir en este periodo de cambio rapido.

AB  - The introduction of the state paradigm of Smart Government allows governments to transform states or individual regions into intelligent ecosystems that use the latest technologies to improve the quality of municipal and state services, create business environments for sustainable economic development, reduce costs and stimulate economical consumption of natural resources. The lack of a consistent conceptual framework as a theoretical platform for the phenomenon of Smart Government inhibits further research and the solving of practical problems in this field. The paper aims to tackle the problem of the ambiguous definition of Smart Government. The methodological basis embraces the theory of network society and the concept of Society of Knowledge. The research method is a scientometric analysis of publications on the formation of Smart Government as a supreme form of e-Government presented in scientific and analytical publications over the past twenty years. The research analyses the key interpretations of Smart Government, identifies its fundamental characteristics and formulates the authors' integrated definition of the phenomenon. The findings show that the issue under discussion gained in popularity during the period of 2014-2019. The study identifies authors and consulting companies that develop models for the transition to smart management both at regional and state levels. It also deals with the sectoral and thematic structure of the publication flow on the issue and reveals the problem of ambiguity of the Smart Government definition. Using semantic analysis, the authors propose their own definition of the concept of Smart Government, which is a developed e-Government based on open management that integrates physical, digital, public and private environments for passive and active interaction and cooperation with citizens so as to support sustainable and flexible development of services and opportunities provided. Five structural elements of the Smart Government are identified by the method of structural-logical analysis: smart indicators, smart goals, smart solutions, technology platform, and technologies. The current research can serve as a theoretical basis for creating smart government transition methods.

AB  - Welsh & Hodgson (2008) argued that stream-associated amphibians (Ascaphus truei, Dicamptodon tenebrosus and Rhyacotriton variegatus) are reliable indicators of ecosystem health in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), U.S.A. We demonstrate that their assertions rely on circular reasoning as well as logical and empirical assumptions that have not received rigorous evaluation.
   Welsh & Hodgson (2008) based their arguments on data collected in northwestern California, U.S.A. However, all three taxa occur across a wide range of environmental gradients in the PNW, and other research results suggest that the taxa respond differentially to environmental perturbations across their geographical distribution. Hence, differences in abundance are not always reliable indicators of the state of an ecosystem, as population numbers can be influenced by factors that may not be associated with habitat quality (e.g. predation and disease).
   Welsh & Hodgson (2008) present indices (rather than estimates) of abundance, which contain an unquantifiable amount of uncertainty not reliably attributable to either environmental or management factors. Evaluating parameters such as reproductive success and survival are more likely to provide strong inference about factors influencing population size than correlative studies that associate some measure of relative abundance with individual habitat features.
   We argue that direct measurement of physical features (water temperature, sediment and wood), for which Welsh & Hodgson (2008) suggest using amphibians as surrogates, is more accurate, efficient and cost effective compared with monitoring cryptic species with methods that are unable to quantify spatial and temporal uncertainty in biological responses.
   Headwater streams are critical components of catchments in the PNW, and all three amphibian taxa show strong associations with low-order streams. However, we think research and monitoring of headwater streams should be guided by hypotheses that evaluate causal mechanisms, rather than relying on descriptive patterns that are limited in geographical scope and which support only weak inference about ecosystem processes. Other studies provide direct links between physical features and responses of target populations (i.e. fish). Adding a second correlative link (i.e. amphibians) provides no added benefit, and increases uncertainty in the association between management actions and changes in population size.

AB  - Antimony (Sb) occurs in the environment both naturally and anthropogenically. Numerous activities cause its anthropogenic accumulation and the release is mainly into the terrestrial environment. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the fate of Sb in soils at the smelting sites where its deposition is often very high and the land needs to be cleaned up. However, little is known regarding the sorption behavior of environmentally found Sb oxidized states in the soils with different characteristics and compositions. The present study examined solubility and toxicity of Sb from the soils polluted due to the smelting operations. An inhibition of seed growth was used as an indicator of the toxic effect of Sb. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted over the pH range of 3-7 and in different equilibrium concentrations of Sb (III) as a form of the smelter release. The water soluble proportion of Sb was low (0.70-1.63%) compared to its deposition in the surface soils; however, extracted amounts caused a slightly reduced germination rate of wheat seeds with a lighter weight. Nevertheless, the soil soluble Sb concentration did not produce severe toxicity symptoms in the growth of roots and sprouts of the germinated seeds. The effects of Sb (III) and (V) forms were slightly different at the level of 5 mg.L-I. In Sb (III) solution the smaller elongation of both sprouts and roots was observed as compared to the control samples while in Sb (V) solution only sprout lengths were shorter. Distribution coefficient (K-d) of Sb in soil water system was estimated to be 56 mL.g(-1) at pH values of 3 and 10-17 ml.g(-1) at pH of 6-7. Thus, neutral pH increases Sb mobility and its translocation to the plants that should be accounted of in agricultural production and remediation activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A numerical study was undertaken to investigate non linearity and the potential for self-organized criticality (SOC) in the evolution of river basins. Twenty-three simulations were carried out, using the authors' CAESAR landscape evolution model, in which the magnitude of storm events, variability of storm events, sediment heterogeneity, sources of sediment supply, and catchment morphology are systematically varied to evaluate their importance as possible drivers for non linear behavior and SOC. Temporal fluctuations in simulated sediment yield show notable non linear behavior. Storm magnitude and occurrence of landslides appear to have little impact on variability of the sediment yield, when compared to the impacts of sediment heterogeneity, rainfall variability and catchment morphology. Particularly, it appears that the non linearity of sediment yields results from the manner in which the catchment processes the variable rainfall, rather than just the rainfall variability itself. The variations in sediment yield show a power law magnitude-frequency distribution, which is a possible, but inconclusive, indicator of SOC. However, several other, more qualitative arguments can be made to support the case for SOC in these simulations. Specifically, we identify the nature of the critical state and suggest two cascade mechanisms by which the system can organize itself around this critical state. Combined, these arguments indicate that simulated evolution of river basins indeed exhibits SOC, at least with respect to sediment yield. The critical state appears to be an indicator of the connectivity of the drainage network. Thus, the simulations indicate that, unlike traditional SOC systems, the critical state of the system can vary in time, as sudden changes in drainage network connectivity may result in sudden changes in the SOC behavior of the system.

AB  - Morphological variability can be used as an indicator of the state of invertebrate populations. Microevolutionary processes can show up in the morphological differentiation of populations. This includes differences between morphometric characters in the two sexes. The variability of 12 populations of Bembidion minimum (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was assessed by 24 morphometric characteristics and indices in this article. Bembidion minimum is a halophile that lives in ecosystems of Protected Areas in Ukraine (Black Sea Biosphere Reserve, Dniprovsko-Orilskyi Nature Reserve, Ornithological Sanctuary "Bulakhovsky Liman", Regional Landscape Park "Dniprovi Porogy", Samara Forest). The coefficients of variation for males, females, and combined populations of males and females were estimated in the article. The studied populations inhabited different soil and plant conditions and were under the influence of anthropogenic factors of varying intensity. The redundancy analysis shows three clusters. In the first cluster, morphometric characteristics and indices in both males and females were linked to environmental variables (herb layer, salt, composition of soil). The second cluster had morphometric characteristics and indices in both males and females with a link to environmental variables (pH, litter, recreational load, cattle grazing). The third cluster formed morphometric characteristics and indices in both males and females that are not affected by any environmental variables. The coefficient of variation for most of the linear morphometric characteristics of B. minimum (width of head, length of prothorax, width of prothorax, length of elytra and distance between setae on the clytra) for males was significantly lower than for the combined sample of males and females. The variability of width of elytra and length of body was significantly higher for females than for males. The degree of variability of males, females and their combined sample did not significantly differ for nonlinear morphometric characteristics, as well as for the six morphometric indices (body proportions) studied by us. In general, in the 12 studied populations of B. minimum, the coefficient of variation for most of the studied measurements was insignificantly lower in males (CV = 5.59%) than in females (6.10%) or in the combined sample of males and females (6.75%). The lowest variability in populations of B. minimum was found for morphometric indices: CV = 3.89% for males, CV = 3.76% for females, and CV = 3.86% for the combined population (males + females). The absence of differences in the mean values of the coefficient of variation between males, females and the combined sample of males and females for each individual population suggests that both males and females make a relatively equal contribution to the polymorphism of B. minimum populations. An assessment of the morphological variability of invertebrates, and especially the variation of coefficients of linear parameters and morphomctric indices, can be used to indicate the state of ecosystems in Protected Areas in Ukraine and other countries.

AB  - Organic matter is an indicator of the soil quality. Knowledge about its different components, explaining the influence of management practices on organic matter and soil aggregation, is essential for the sustainability of agricultural systems. In the present work, we evaluated humic substances, microbial activity and labile organic carbon in a Dystrophic Red Latosol from Minas Gerais state, Brazil, under natural vegetation (Cerradao) or under 30-years of conventional corn cultivation. Soil samples were collected from depths of 5-10 and 15-20 cm at four different sites. Then the samples were dried, and fractioned in aggregate classes (diameter 4.75-2.0; 2.0-1.0; 1.0-0.5, 0.5-0.25; 0.25-0. 105; and less than 0.105 mm). Furthermore, organic carbon of fulvic acid (AF), humic acids (AH) and humins (HUM) fractions, and labile organic carbon (COL) using KMnO4 15.6 and 33.0 mmol L-1 of the samples were determined. The material was further subjected to a respirometry test, in which CO2 production values were adjusted to logistic equations [Y = a / 1 + e(-(b +) (cx))] to estimate the time needed to achieve half of the maximum CO2 (t(1/2)), production. Results showed higher mean organic carbon contents in the AH fraction and COL with KMnO4 33.0 mmol L-1 of soil aggregates under conventional tillage. For AF and HUM fractions and COL with KMnO4 15.6 mmol L-1 this behavior was only observed in the 15-20 cm layer. The highest CO2 production was observed in the aggregates of the soil under Cerradao. The smaller aggregates tended to present higher organic carbon contents in the AF and AH fractions and COL. These were responsible for the highest CO2 production and constituted favorable sites of organic matter storage, due to the physical and chemical protection, as well as for mineralization, since microorganisms prefer these sites. The coefficients of the logistic equation (a, b, c) and the t(1/2) can be considered important indicators of organic matter quality and lability under different managements.

AB  - Simple Summary: Crocodiles are territorial reptiles that are exposed to both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Analyzing their state of health and the environment in which they live is essential to detect changes that could affect them by exposure to agents that damage their genetic material, putting their health or other species that share said habitat, including humans, at risk. There are several ways to determine exposure to harmful agents, a very simple and direct one is to analyze the nuclei of blood cells under a microscope, a test that can also be carried out directly in their habitat and that gives rapid results on the effects of agents on those at that moment they are exposed. This study demonstrates the possibility of analyzing the blood of Crocodylus moreletii to quickly analyze its exposure to toxic agents in a sample of its blood by evaluating two abnormal structures in its cells under the microscope, demonstrating that evidence of damage can be observed only by analyzing a drop of their blood.Micronuclei (MN) are used to assess genotoxic exposure, whereas nuclear buds (NBs) have been linked to genotoxic events. Crocodylus moreletii was studied to identify MN and NBs. Three groups were formed: Group 1 (water) and groups 2 and 3 (7 or 10 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide). A drop of blood was obtained daily from the claw tip at 0 to 120 h. Spontaneous micronucleated erythrocytes (MNEs) and erythrocytes with nuclear buds (NBEs) were counted. The frequencies of micronucleated young erythrocytes (MNYEs) and NB young erythrocytes (NBYEs) were evaluated, including the ratio of young erythrocytes (YE)/1000 total erythrocytes. No significant differences were observed in the YE proportion on sampling days; group 1 did not show differences for any parameter, whereas group 2 showed significant differences in MNEs and NBEs, and group 3 showed differences in NBEs and NBYEs. Some mitotic activity in circulation was observed in YEs. In conclusion, NBEs could be a more sensitive biomarker to genotoxic damage than MNEs. The identification of these biomarkers leads us to propose Crocodylus moreletii as a possible environment bioindicator because these parameters could be useful to analyze the in vivo health status of these reptiles and for biomonitoring genotoxic pollutants in their habitats.

AB  - Nonnative plant species continue to be introduced into North America both accidentally and intentionally for horticultural and agricultural purposes. Some new species will spread extensively and some will become weeds of importance. We used a floristic database (INVADERS) to examine the status of incipient plant invasions in the northwest United States (Washington, Oregon, Idaho. Montana and Wyoming). We queried INVADERS for distribution records elf plant species exotic to North America that were first recorded in the northwest states during 1950-1996. The query resulted in records for 288 species, of which 133 were judged to have become established (based on collector notes), or to have high potential to spread beyond artificial environments such as lawns and gardens. Inherent potential for invasion was based on examination of several invasive plant lists and the international literature on plant invasions. Thirty species have become moderately widespread (reported from >5 counties) in the five-state northwest region, and several are known to be aggressive invaders in other regions of North America or in other parts of the world. Five species discussed in the text are notable for rapid spread and/or indications of aggressiveness: Polygonum cuspidatum (syn: Fallopia japonica, Reynoutria japonica), Bryonia alba, Impatiens glandulifera, Hieracium pratense and Scorzonera laciniata. Compared with the early exotics (mid 1800s - early 1900s), which tended to be annual herbs, the post-1950 exotic flora shows a trend reward greater proportions of perennials and woody growth forms (shrubs and trees). Some applications of floristic databanks in regional-scale management of plant invasions are discussed.

AB  - In urban areas, storm water runoff often transports various pollutants, some of which settle and form sediments. In order to have the comprehensive view of the ecological state of storm water runoff recipients, both water and sediments of the stream must be assessed. In the Baltic Sea Area, the Water Framework Directive & HELCOM Recommendations aim to prevent or minimise pollution caused by harmful substances arising from storm water runoff, in order to promote the ecological restoration of the Baltic Sea-one of the most vulnerable seas. The aim of the study was to investigate the toxicity of bottom sediments of a small storm water runoff recipient focusing on the potential impact of successive discharges of urban storm water. Some storm water runoff quality parameters and the toxicity of bottom sediments of recipients was studied in this research.
   During 9 years, at four discharge points, minimum four grab samples per year at each discharge point were taken for chemical characterisation. General parameters (pH, SS, BOD7, CODCr and TPH) in liquid phase samples were analysed according to standard methods. Annual limit values were taken from the Lithuanian EPA requirements for the management of storm water runoff with a focus on prevention and control of contamination. Eleven composite samples of stream bottom sediments, each consisting of ten sub-samples, were collected in 2006. Toxicity screening from sediments was performed using the plant Lepidium sativum according to modified I. Magone's methodology (Magone I, Bioindication of phytotoxicity of transport emission. In: Kachalova O-L, Zinatne (eds) Bioindication of toxicity of transport emissions in the impact of highway emissions on natural environment. Riga, pp 108-116, 1989). The level of toxic impact of Lepidium sativum (compared to control) was assessed according to the modified method of Wang (Rev Environ Contam Toxicol 126:88-127, 1992).
   The mean pH of urban storm water runoff does not vary much from neutral, but range values are quite different, from 4.0 up to 8.7. The highest concentration of SS reached 800 mg L-1, TPH-2.4 mg L-1, BOD7-300 mg O-2 L-1 and CODCr-1,400 mg L-1. The SS was above the limit in 64% of total amount of grab samples, TPH-37%, BOD7-41% and CODCr-55%. The toxicity analysis of the bottom sediments showed varying toxicity of bottom sediments along the stream. From nine analysed samples of bottom sediments, 30% had weak toxicity, 30% medium and 30% strong toxicity on the test organism plant L. sativum. There was one single sample with no toxic effects, so that the results showed that urban storm water has an unacceptable environmental impact on recipients. It was also indicated that storm water runoff discharge alone is not the potential source of toxicity of bottom sediments. The litter demonstrated a weak toxicity of bottom sediments as well.
   Most local authorities do not consider storm water runoff discharges to be a matter of great concern because they believe that surface runoff arising from rainfall is still relatively clean. The study showed that the current method of monitoring storm water runoff quality by chemical analyses is not the best tool for environmental impact assessment and must be combined with toxicity tests of bottom sediments of recipients.
   To avoid the environmental impact of storm water runoff more attention should be paid to the development and implementation of storm water runoff pollution prevention measures. The study implies that future research concerning the relationships between storm water runoff deposit characteristics and biological activities must be developed to evaluate the contamination potential of stream sediment deposits for local aquatic ecosystems. Further studies should be developed to characterise the activities of the microbial community of storm water runoff sediments, and to monitor bioremediation in situ.

AB  - The intensive shift on land cover by anthropogenic activities have led to changes in natural habitats and environmental contamination, which can ultimately impact and threat biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as pollination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of native forest and human-modified land covers on the concentrations of chemical elements accumulated in the neotropical pollinator bee T. angustula. Eight landscapes, within an Ecological Corridor in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with gradients of forest cover, spatial heterogeneity and varying land covers were used as sampling unities. Bees collected in traps or through actives searches had the concentration of 21 chemical elements determined by ICP-MS. Results show a beneficial effect of forested areas on the concentrations of some well-known toxic elements accumulated in bees, such as Hg, Cd, and Cr. Multivariate Redundancy Analysis (RDA) suggests road as the most important driver for the levels of Cr, Hg, Sb, Al, U, As, Pb and Pt and bare soil, pasture and urban areas as the landscape covers responsible for the concentrations of Zn, Cd, Mn, Mg, Ba and Sr in bees. The results reinforce the potential use of T. angustula bees as bioindicators of environmental quality and also show that these organisms are being directly affected by human land use, offering potential risks for the Neotropical ecosystem. Our study sheds light on how land covers (native forest and human-modified) can influence the levels of contaminants in insects within human-dominated landscapes. The generation of predictions of the levels of toxic metals and metalloids based on land use can both contribute to friendly farming planning as well as to support public policy development on the surrounding of protected areas and biodiversity conservation hotspots.

AB  - The call for ecosystem considerations in marine management has instigated the use of ecosystem indicators. Many ecosystem indicators have been suggested under new policy frameworks such as the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive or the Common Fisheries Policy. But many of these indicators are still under development and cannot be considered as yet operational for environmental assessments. A common reason for this lack of operationability is the absence of valid assessment benchmarks. This study introduces a two-stage approach for the benchmarking and assessment of time series (TSBA) against a priori chosen rationale of improvement or maintenance of current conditions. TSBA uses breakpoint- and trend-analysis to obtain long-term benchmarks and assess short term progress. Depending on the outcome of both analyses the action requirements for management can be determined:The method is exemplified on a case study on the size-structure of large North Sea gadoid stocks, which are considered as being sensitive to the impacts of fishing. Three out of six stocks reached their assessment benchmarks, while the three other stocks failed. TSBA is generic and can be applied to any indicator used within any marine policy assessment framework. A strength-weaknesses-opportunity-threat analysis (SWOT) investigated the advantages and disadvantages of TSBA in the context of the currently high political demand of operational ecosystem indicators. Contrary to benchmarks derived from ecological concepts or pressure-state relationship TSBA benchmarks are not specifically linked to limits of resilience or sustainability. However, TSBA may be especially useful in situations where assessment benchmarks from other sources will not be readily available or are associated with high uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Itaqui reservoir in Parana state, southern Brazil, is dominated by the floating macrophyte Pistia stratiotes L. and is used for recreation and irrigation. The reservoir's excessive plant cover suggests an extreme trophic state and interferes with multiple uses. The aims of this study were to determine the trophic state of the reservoir water and to document the limnological conditions and the composition of the periphytic diatom community before and after the mechanical removal of macrophytes. As each diatom species has certain autoecological requirements in a given geographic area, another objective of the study was to identify diatoms that can be considered tolerant of the reservoir's trophic state in a substropical environment. Local water samples collected for physical and chemical analyses, including estimates of chlorophyll a, showed the hypereutrophic status of the reservoir before and after macrophyte removal. Environmental conditions exceeded acceptable values for fishing and irrigation, providing a clear example of how the inadequate management of water resources can directly reduce their usefulness. Trimestral sampling was carried out between May 2008 and February 2009. For quantitative analyses, biofilms were scrubbed off glass slides submerged for 30 days at a depth of approximately 40 cm. Diatom samples were cleaned with potassium permanganate and hydrochloric acid and mounted on permanent slides with Naphrax. All individuals found in random transects under three replicates were identified and counted up to a minimum of 600 valves. Thirteen species tolerant of eutrophication were selected. Four species mostly known from low-nutrient sites may be considered tolerant of eutrophic conditions. The composition of the diatom community was influenced by seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall. Canonical Correspondence Analyses confirmed a correlation between higher diatom densities and the increased photic zone following macrophyte removal.

TI  - Topological order detection and qubit encoding in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type quantum dot arrays
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
LA  - English
AB  - In this study, building on the 1D topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, we propose a model of quantum dot arrays with odd and even parity and variable on-site local potentials to examine topological edge states and a possible quantum information encoding, using these states. We first investigate the SSH model with alternating tunneling amplitudes t(1) and t(2). We study the model in a ring-like structure and then proceed to minimal open-end chains with even ( N = 4) and odd ( N = 5) number of dots. Furthermore, we depart from the basic SSH model by introducing local potentials mu(i), which offer additional control at the cost of breaking the chiral symmetry of the Hamiltonian and study the implications. Then, we propose an idealized "static " charge qubit design, based on encoding the topological invariant nu as qubit states, that exploits the topological nature of the edge states and their collective character. We introduce perturbing noise delta t(q)& nbsp;( t ) into the system and demonstrate the robustness of the states for some range of the ratio xi = t(1)& nbsp;/t(2). Moreover, we show a possible way to detect the presence of topological order in the system using equilibrium dynamics for both even and odd chains. We utilize the quantum informatic measure of bipartite mutual information I-{ b : e } (( 2 )) ( t ) as a measure of bulk-edge quantum correlations and a quantitative indicator for the manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence; here, we also propose a dynamical qubit encoding with nu for specific quantum chain parity. Finally, we offer a few remarks on potential future explorations.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Author(s).

AB  - The association between the nutritional state of mongrel dogs naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and their infectivity to Triatoma infestans bugs and immune response to Trypanosoma cruzi were studied in the rural village of Amama, northwestern Argentina. All of the 97 evaluated dogs were classified into one of three categories of external clinical aspect (ECA) based on the degree of muscle development, external evidence of bone structures, state of the hair of the coat, existence of fatty deposits, and facial expression. ECA was significantly associated with two nutritional indicators, hematocrit and skin-fold thickness, but not with total serum proteins. For all dogs, hematocrit was significantly correlated with skin-fold thickness. The 2-year survival probability decreased significantly from 60.7% for dogs with good ECA to 45.9% and 31.2% for those with regular and bad EGA, respectively. The age-adjusted relative odds of infection for Triatoma infestans xenodiagnosis nymphs that fed once on a dog seroreactive for Trypanosoma cruzi decreased significantly as ECA improved, when tested by multiple logistic regression analysis. A delayed hypersensitivity reaction was observed in all of the seroreactive dogs with good ECA but only in 45-50% of those with regular or bad EGA. Dogs with bad ECA had a 2.6 and 6.3 times greater probability of infecting triatomines after a single full blood meal than dogs with regular or good EGA, respectively. Our study shows that the reservoir competence of does for Trypanosoma cruzi was associated with EGA, which is a surrogate and valid index of nutritional state.

AB  - A global phenomenon of increasing bark beetle-induced tree mortality has heightened concerns regarding ecosystem response and biogeochemical implications. Here, we explore microbial dynamics under lodgepole pines through the analysis of bulk (16S rRNA gene) and potentially active (16S rRNA) communities to understand the terrestrial ecosystem responses that are associated with this form of large-scale tree mortality. We found that the relative abundances of bulk and potentially active taxa were correlated across taxonomic levels, but at lower levels, cladal differences became more apparent. Despite this correlation, there was a strong differentiation of community composition between bulk and potentially active taxa, with further clustering associated with the stages of tree mortality. Surprisingly, community clustering as a function of tree phase had limited correlation to soil water content and total nitrogen concentrations, which were the only two measured edaphic parameters to differ in association with tree phase. Bacterial clustering is more readily explained by the observed decrease in the abundance of active, rare microorganisms after tree death in conjunction with stable alpha diversity measurements. This enables the rare fraction of the terrestrial microbial community to maintain metabolic diversity by transitioning between metabolically active and dormant states during this ecosystem disturbance and contributes disproportionately to community dynamics and archived metabolic capabilities. These results suggest that analyzing bulk and potentially active communities after beetle infestation may be a more sensitive indicator of disruption than measuring local edaphic parameters.
   IMPORTANCE
   Forests around the world are experiencing unprecedented mortality due to insect infestations that are fueled in part by a changing climate. While aboveground processes have been explored, changes at the terrestrial interface that are relevant to microbial biogeochemical cycling remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the changing bulk and potentially active microbial communities beneath healthy and beetle-killed trees. We found that, even though few edaphic parameters were altered from beetle infestation, the rare microbes were more likely to be active and fluctuate between dormancy and metabolic activity. This indicates that rare as opposed to abundant taxa contribute disproportionately to microbial community dynamics and presumably biogeochemical cycling within these types of perturbed ecosystems.

AB  - The Brown Meagre from Tunisian coasts, Sciaena umbra (Sciaenidae): sexual cycle, age and growth.
   The aim of that work was to study reproduction and growth of Sciaena umbra, for which the biology still remains largely unknown on its whole distribution area. Brown Meagres, caught by artisanal fishing gears and trawlers, are bought in the central market of Tunis and come from Tunis bay. Fish were sampled several times by month from September 1995 to August 1996. The whole sample comprises 227 juveniles, 343 females and 238 males, with standard lengths (SL) ranging respectively from 9 to 19.6 cm, 10.4 to 41.2 cm and 10.7 to 36.6 cm.
   For the reproduction study, we have established a scale of gonad maturity using macroscopic observation; then, the percentage of mature specimens by sexes was calculated for each size class and the sizes related to 50% and 100% taken as the length at first maturity. The periods of sexual cycle were determined by analysing monthly the evolution of the gonadosomatic index (GSI). Moreover, to obtain some information on the species physiology, the hepatosomatic index (HIS), the condition factor (K) the nutrition index (NI) and the length-weight relationships were calculated for each period of the sexual cycle and statistically compared. Concerning the growth study, we have used, for the first time to our knowledge, scales to estimate the age for this species. The annulus was described in detail and photographed. The monthly evolution of marginal increment was analysed. Retrocalculated lengths were estimated by the non-linear proportional method of back-calculation attributed to Monastyrsky (in Francis, 1990) considering the "body proportional hypothesis" or BPH. Retrocalculated lengths were modelised taking into account the biological age (birth date on July and annulus formation on April).
   Sizes (SL) related to 50% and 100% of matured individuals were, respectively, for males 20 and 22 cm and for females 21 and 23 cm. Sciaena umbra reproduction happens from March to August. Gonad maturation takes place from March to June; spawning occurs in July and August while sexual resting extends from September to March. During the sexual resting period, Brown Meagres accumulate hepatic lipidic reserves. Feeding is significantly reduced throughout gonads maturation. Spawning leads to a decrease of condition and this is also confirmed by the fact that length-weight relationships point out a negative allometric growth only during spawning and an isometric one during the rest of the year. Only one annulus was registered on the scale in relation to a growth break in winter, when sea temperature is low. Growth started again on spring and went on till autumn when the sea temperature raises gradually. Scalimetry allowed us to "read" the age with accuracy only for fishes below nine years old. The parameters of the fitted von Bertalanffy growth equation were LSinfinity = 44.8 cm, Pe(infinity) = 1986.10 g, k = 0.186 /year, to = - 0.828 year for females and LSinfinity = 37.1 cm, Pe(infinity) = 1166.81 g, k = 0.225 /year, to = - 0.817 year for males. So it was noticeable that length and weight of the females were, for the same age, always higher than the males ones. Sexual dimorphism became more pronounced from the third year when the Brown Meagre acquired approximately 50% size at first sexual maturity. The maximum standard length was 41.2 cm (TL = 49.6 cm) for the females and 36.6 cm (TL = 44.4 cm) for the males. Theoretical maximum age was approximately 16 years for the females and 13 years for the males.

AB  - Nowadays, we are facing a global change associated with the rapid population growth and natural resources demand, whose impacts are accumulated in space and during the time. Therefore, humanity could be identified as Planet's Ecological Bigfoot. The anthropopressure disturbed the Earth's natural regulatory capacity, which could be noticed by the unavailability of freshwater, irregular temperatures, or interrupted biogeochemical flows. Moreover, the growth of population is expected, as well as the sprawl of urbanized areas, increasing demand for living space, food, and humans' ecological footprint. Therefore, the aim of the study was the implementation of the environmental carrying capacity (ECC) approach for more sustainable spatial management, especially in the context of developing residential areas in the city-region. The research evaluates the spatial policy established by the municipalities of the city and its surroundings and presents alternative scenarios of residential areas development. The alternative scenarios were built using excluded and restricted environmental zones to protect productive ecosystems. The impact of residential areas designed in spatial documents and scenarios has been assessed using the carbon footprint (CF) and biocapacity (BC) indicators within the environmental carrying capacity (ECC) framework. The lifestyle archetypes of the city's residents and its suburban zone were used as the main input for the assessment of CF and the natural areas required to assimilate human consumption. The comparison of CF and BC allowed verifying the consumed vs. available resources and to quantify the state of the environment. First of all, the research indicated the potential areas for the future development of human settlements. Secondly, the potential number of inhabitants in residential areas was assessed. Furthermore, the impact of inhabitants was quantified using the ECC approach. Finally, the surface of natural areas required for CF assimilation was assessed. The proposed approach could be relevant for spatial management, spatial policy evaluation, and modeling. It could provide a management tool and policy instrument for the sustainable development of human settlements. Moreover, it proposes implementation of environmental zones for allocation of land-use for housing purpose in a more sustainable manner, which is currently not used within the ECC assessment.

AB  - Chronic stress is a risk factor for a variety of physiological disorders because of its increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; however, it is difficult to reveal environmental and genetic effects contributing to long-term HPA activity because of the complexity of chronic stress. The hair cortisol concentration (HCC) can be used to reflect the accumulation of HPA axis activity over time. Some studies suggest that the HCC might be associated with the protein concentration (PC) in the hair shaft; however, no studies have revealed a dynamic relationship between them. In the present study, 1,086 hair samples from 418 Holstein cows were collected, and the effects of environmental factors on HCC, PC, and ratio of HCC to PC (HCCP) were studied. Subsequently, regression analysis and curve fitting were used to identify for better-performing indicators of chronic stress. Additionally, univariate and bivariate genetic evaluation were used to estimate the genetic components of cortisol traits and genotype by environment interactions (G & times; E) under different environmental and physiological states. The results showed that HCC and PC are significantly affected by hair color, sampling year, and season, whereas HCCP is not influenced by hair color. Adjusted PC and HCCP, where confounding effects are excluded, were moderately related with chronic stress indicators. Moderate to high heritabilities were obtained for HCC (0.347 and 0.390 for winter and summer, respectively), PC (0.402 and 0.495 for winter and summer, respectively) and HCCP (0.289 and 0.460 for winter and summer, respectively) when animals in the same season were evaluated. A moderate G & times; E interaction was detected in this study, as indicated by the low or negative genetic correlation for the same cortisol trait in different environments (e.g. heat stress condition and thermoneutral condition). In conclusion, HCCP is not affected by hair color compared with the other 2 traits; thus, it has potential as an indicator of chronic stress. Hair cortisol traits could monitor stress response process in cattle, as well as provide a better understanding of genetic mechanism for long-term HPA activity.

AB  - Introduction. The purpose of the study is the determining the use of which type of regulation will achieve the best indicators of quality control for the regulation of the evaporator plant.
   Materials and methods. The system of management of a five-body evaporator plant of a sugar refinery was researched. The method of synthesis of modal control was used for evaluating the results of the research.
   Results and discussion. A comparison between FID and fuzzy regulator was made. Regulation of such responsible parameters as levels of concentrated juice in evaporator plant bodies, which directly affect the quality and value of manufactured products, was implemented. First, in the space of states in Matlab environment, a mathematical model was developed and the results obtained regarding the variation of the problem with respect to the initial conditions and perturbations were obtained. Due to them one can conclude that the time of the transition process is within the range from 0.8 to 1.2 seconds. However, the deviation levels in the evaporator plant bodies are too high. Secondly, a mathematical model with a PID-regulator was developed and transition processes for control schemes across all control channels were obtained. In this case, the time of transition processes is within the range of 60 seconds along the channel X1 to 145 seconds along the channel X2, but this led to a significant decrease in the deviation of levels in the bodies. Thirdly, a mathematical model with a fuzzy regulator is developed and transition processes for control schemes in all control channels were obtained. In this case, the time of transition processes is within the range from 50 seconds along the channel X1 to 110 seconds along the channel X2, which is the better result if compared to the PID regulator. Compared with the previous study, the levels in the bodies also significantly decreased. Therefore, the use of neuro-fuzzy regulation leads to an increase in qualitative parameters of the process compared with the system with PID -regulators.
   Conclusions. The scientific substantiation of the feasibility of using neuro-fuzzy regulation during the implementation of optimal control systems is the novelty of the research results.

AB  - Sandy shores comprise one of the coastal ecosystems most vulnerable to human impacts, and they are increasingly affected by a variety of stressors. Local-scale drivers such as man-made freshwater discharges have changed the salinity, temperature and nutrient regimes, leading to the degradation of sandy beaches. However, there is still little understanding about the effects of salinity changes on the structure and functioning of sandy shores at the ecosystem level of ecological organization. This study seeks to identify the main spatial and long-term variations in a sandy beach ecosystem due to salinity changes induced by a freshwater discharge using a trophic network approach and thus linking anthropogenic pressures with functional and structural ecosystem changes. The trophic networks of nine scenarios involving three sampling sites representing different salinity stress regimes and three study phases established between 1987 and 2015 were modelled and compared. The results showed important space-time variations that were reflected at the community and ecosystem levels. A more complex trophic structure was developed with longer distances to the freshwater inflow, with higher biomass, species richness and number of predators. The highly disturbed and undisturbed sites occupied discrete, contrasting and clearly distinguishable states over time, whereas the moderately disturbed site showed a variable pattern over time. Recent trends in ecosystem indicators reflected a more fragile state, characterized by a greater organization (Ascendency) and a lower adaptive potential (Overhead) to address unexpected disturbances. Ecosystem indicators were sensitive enough to distinguish among sites and long-term phases in the ecosystem, where different organization states can persist over time. Future studies aimed at assessing press disturbances on sandy beach ecosystems should emphasize a longer time scale in order to assess the recovery capacity of these systems that are increasingly threatened by long-lasting stressors.

AB  - Fire is a prevalent feature of many landscapes and has numerous and complex effects on geological, hydrological, ecological, and economic systems. In some regions, the frequency and intensity of wildfire have increased in recent years and are projected to escalate with predicted climatic and landuse changes. In addition, prescribed burns continue to be used in many parts of the world to clear vegetation for development projects, encourage desired vegetation, and reduce fuel loads. Given the prevalence of fire on the landscape, authors of papers in this special series examine the complexities of fire as a disturbance shaping freshwater ecosystems and highlight the state of the science. These papers cover key aspects of fire effects that range from vegetation loss and recovery in watersheds to effects on hydrology and water quality with consequences for communities (from algae to fish), food webs, and ecosystem processes (e.g., organic matter subsidies, nutrient cycling) across a range of scales. The results presented in this special series of articles expand our knowledge of fire effects in different biomes, water bodies, and geographic regions, encompassing aquatic population, community, and ecosystem responses. In this overview, we summarize each paper and emphasize its contributions to knowledge on fire ecology and freshwater ecosystems. This overview concludes with a list of 7 research foci that are needed to further our knowledge of fire effects on aquatic ecosystems, including research on: 1) additional biomes and geographic regions; 2) additional habitats, including wetlands and lacustrine ecosystems; 3) different fire severities, sizes, and spatial configurations; and 4) additional response variables (e.g., ecosystem processes) 5) over long (> 5 y) time scales 6) with more rigorous study designs and data analyses, and 7) consideration of the effects of fire management practices and policies on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Environmental problems mean that herbicide applications must be drastically reduced and optimized. Models that quantify the effects of crop management techniques on weed dynamics are valuable tools for designing weed management strategies. Indeed, the techniques to be optimized are numerous and diverse, and their effects vary considerably with environmental conditions and the state of the weed flora. In the present study, a mechanistic weed dynamics model, ALOMYSYS, was used to carry out in silico experiments in order to: (1) rank crop management components according to the resulting decrease in weed infestation, and (2) study the sensitivity of the major component effects to biophysical field state variables in order to identify indicators and thresholds that could serve for future decision-rules for farmers. The various results were compiled into rules for optimizing timing and other options (tillage tools, herbicide types) for the different crop management techniques. The rules were based on a series of biophysical field state variables, i.e. cumulated rainfall, thermal time, soil moisture and weed densities prior to the operation, in the previous and pre-previous crops. For instance, the first tillage should be delayed until the cumulated rainfall since harvest exceeds 50 mm and be carried out in moist conditions. Mouldboard ploughing is advised if the infestation of the previous crop exceeds 20 weeds/m(2) and particularly if this exceeds 0.3 times that of the pre-previous crop. Ploughing should occur when the cumulated rainfall since harvest reaches 100-200 mm. The effects of crop succession and long-term effects of management techniques have been studied in a companion paper (Colbach et al. 2012).

AB  - Metal contamination in freshwater ecosystems is a global issue and metal discharges to aquatic environments are monitored in order to protect aquatic life and human health. Bioavailability is an important factor determining metal toxicity. In aquatic systems, metal bioavailability depends on local water and sediment characteristics, and therefore, the risks are site-specific. Environmental quality standards (EQS) are used to manage the risks of metals in aquatic environments. In the simplest form of EQSs, total concentrations of metals in water or sediment are compared against pre-set acceptable threshold levels. Now, however, the environmental administration bodies have stated the need to incorporate metal bioavailability assessment tools into environmental regulation.
   Scientific advances have been made in metal bioavailability assessment, including passive samplers and computational models, such as biotic ligand models (BLM). However, the cutting-edge methods tend to be too elaborate or laborious for standard environmental monitoring. We review the commonly used metal bioavailability assessment methods and introduce the latest scientific advances that might be applied to environmental management in the future. We present the current practices in environmental management in North America, Europe and China, highlighting the good practices and the needs for improvement.
   Environmental management has met these new challenges with varying degrees of success: the USA has implemented site-specific environmental risk assessment for water and sediment phases, and they have already implemented metal mixture toxicity evaluation. The European Union is promoting the use of bioavailability and BLMs in ecological risk assessment (ERA), but metal mixture toxicity and sediment phase are still mostly neglected. China has regulation only for total concentrations of metals in surface water. We conclude that there is a need for (1) Advanced and up-to-date guidelines and legislation, (2) New and simple scientific methods for assessing metal bioavailability and (3) Improvement of knowledge and skills of administrators.

AB  - Wetlands exist in complex ecological conditions that are changeable in time and space in terms of function and structural diversity. In recent decades, wetlands have been exposed to a wide range of threats. Assessment of these threats is essential to develop an understanding of the state of a wetland ecosystem and to develop a suitable management strategy. This paper discusses wetland vulnerability in terms of analysis of human and environmental systems from application of the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. This assessment presented a systematic methodology for assessment of wetland vulnerability in a social-ecological approach applying broad-scale ecosystem services and vulnerability functions. The method combined the hydro geomorphic approach with estimations of vulnerability indicators and DPSIR analysis. The aim of this paper was to assess vulnerability of wetland ecosystem services and to characterize the threat indicators according to importance, severity, and probability of occurrence. Quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to characterize values for these three indicators. The Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method was used to prioritize threats and impacts of the wetland on the basis of experts' opinions. The proposed methodology was applied to the Choghakhor international wetland landscape in south-western Iran. Vulnerability assessment revealed that water requirement of the lowland and the water transfer system were the most important factors threatening the wetland. Agricultural activities, settlements and urban areas, drought, tourism, population growth, and mining activities in the upland were the next most important priorities, in that order. Hydrological balance was determined as the most vulnerable function and was considered as the most important function in the Choghakhor wetland. The DPSIR model was used to determine a management strategy to reduce vulnerability of ecosystem services in response to drivers, pressures, states and impacts indicated by modelling.

AB  - Because studies of environmental accidents must be initiated after the fact and because the accidents cannot (or should not) be replicated, sampling cannot be entirely randomized, and investigations involve some degree of confounding and pseudoreplication. The study designs that can be used carry methodological limitations and ecological assumptions, which must be considered in evaluating results. The methodological issues relate to consistency in sampling methods and to the adequacy of sampling of levels of environmental disturbance or contamination, while the ecological assumptions derive from spatial and temporal variation in biological resources and the factors that affect them.
   We assess how these methodological issues and ecological assumptions affect study designs based on before-after comparisons and on single-time or multiple-time sampling after an accident. Designs that rest on the assumption of a steady-state equilibrium in resource-environment relationships (baseline and time-series designs) must be interpreted with particular care, and baseline designs are sensitive to the effects of pseudoreplication and inconsistencies in methods. Other designs (pre/post paired samples, impact level-by-time, impact trend-by-time) assume only that environmental variations are equivalent among areas and/or contamination levels (a dynamic equilibrium) and are less affected by pseudoreplication. Single-time designs (comparisons between impact and reference sites, between matched paired sites, or over a contamination gradient) have fewer methodological limitations, but assume that other natural factors that may influence the response of a resource are equal among all samples. If measurements of other factors are included in the design, covariance analysis may help to reduce this problem. In evaluating the effects of unplanned environmental impacts, post facto study designs that document both initial effects and subsequent recovery (impact level-by-time, impact trend-by-time) or that treat effects as continuous rather than categorical variables (gradient or trend designs) may be more useful than before-after comparisons.

AB  - The recent boom in shale gas development in the Marcellus Shale has increased interest in the methods to distinguish between naturally occurring methane in groundwater and stray methane associated with drilling and production operations. This study evaluates the relationship between natural methane occurrence and three principal environmental factors (groundwater redox state, water type, and topography) using two pre-drill datasets of 132 samples from western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia and 1417 samples from northeastern Pennsylvania. Higher natural methane concentrations in residential wells are strongly associated with reducing conditions characterized by low nitrate and low sulfate ([NO3-]< 0.5 mg/L; [SO42-]< 2.5mg/L). However, no significant relationship exists between methane and iron [Fe(II)], which is traditionally considered an indicator of conditions that have progressed through iron reduction. As shown in previous studies, water type is significantly correlated with natural methane concentrations, where sodium (Na) -rich waters exhibit significantly higher (p < 0.001) natural methane concentrations than calcium (Ca)-rich waters. For water wells exhibiting Na-rich waters and/or low nitrate and low sulfate conditions, valley locations are associated with higher methane concentrations than upland topography. Consequently, we identify three factors ("Low NO3- & SO42-'' redox condition, Na-rich water type, and valley location), which, in combination, offer strong predictive power regarding the natural occurrence of high methane concentrations. Samples exhibiting these three factors have a median methane concentration of 10,000 mu g/L. These heuristic relationships may facilitate the design of pre-drill monitoring programs and the subsequent evaluation of post-drill monitoring results to help distinguish between naturally occurring methane and methane originating from anthropogenic sources or migration pathways.

AB  - Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) play an essential role in promoting sustainable development by coordinating and balancing economic, social, and environmental objectives. As one of its mandatory components, stakeholder participation (SP) is designed to contribute to the implementation of EIAs as well as the relevant decision making with regard to a proposed project. Stakeholder participation ranges from being a token process to being a very effective practice; it has been criticized as ineffective in an authoritarian context. This research investigates the SP process of project EIAs via 3 case studies. A developed State-Attribution-Motivation- Interaction-Reengineering (SAMIR) framework is used to identify the causes, results, and substantive changes among 3 main actors or organizations: citizens, enterprises, and local governments. It demonstrates that the endogenous interactions among 3 institutional pillars-regulative, normative, and cognitive-are the root of institutional change. Initial cognitive actions can lead to regulative and normative social institutional change, thus stimulating the reengineering of the institutions' system relevant to SP. To facilitate institutional innovation and reengineering of SP with Chinese characteristics, it is of crucial importance to deeply reform and detail institutional design, to promote the SP governance structural change from a closed model to an open model. In order for such change to occur, the following are recommended: Move from government to governance, have institutional innovations follow the mass line, pay more attention to fairness rather than focusing on efficiency, and in addition, disseminate science and promote actors' communication. The benefits and advantages are instruments to overcome the "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) impact. And reengineering government structural change from and administration paradigm to a governance paradigm plays a primary role. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:607-620. (c) 2019 SETAC

AB  - Riparian forests play multitude of fundamental roles in the preservation of the environment. In order to assess its conservation state, different indexes can be used, such as the QBR ('Qualitat del bosc de ribera') that estimates conservation status of the riparian forest. Another widely used way of estimating the state of an ecosystem can be based on bioindicator groups, such as ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). In this work we intend to demonstrate that ants are an excellent bioindicator group of the riparian forests quality, comparing them with a widely used and extend index (QBR) in the Mediterranean basin. In this study we sampled the ant communities using pitfall traps in 14 riparian forest of the Guadalquivir River. The captured ants were identified and the abundance in number of workers of each species was determined. Also, we determined the perturbation variables (QBR index, nearest urban centres and nearest urban centres > 20,000 inhabitants) for each area. A total of 41 species were found in the sampled areas and high correlations were obtained between the QBR index and the Shannon index, Equitability and number of species. Using multivariate analysis (PLS and Non-Metric MDS), a strong correlation was found between perturbation variables and abundance per species in each grove, as well as a strong correlation between perturbation variables themselves.
   Therefore, we can affirm that ants are a good indicator to estimate the state of conservation of riparian forest, since they are highly correlated with different variables that estimate the state of conservation. In a certain way, a high QBR index will be linked to diverse ecosystems. In addition, greater distances to urban centres, which are sources of anthropic disturbance, will be linked to less diverse ecosystems. It has also been detected in the sampled groves that there is a certain amount of species that are related to a good state of conservation (QBR), such as Temnothorax pardoi, Temnothorax recedens and Camponotus lateralis. Analogously, it has been detected that Hypoponera eduardi is a common species in groves with worse state of conservation.

AB  - The economic and ecological impacts of fish consumption by marine mammals, the associated interactions with commercial fish stocks, and the forage demands of these marine mammal populations are largely unknown. Consumption estimates are often either data deficient or not fully evaluated in a rigorous, quantitative manner. Although consumption estimates exist for the Northeast United States (NEUS) Large Marine Ecosystem, there is considerable uncertainty in those estimates. We examined consumption estimates for 12 marine mammal species inhabiting the regional ecosystem. We used sensitivity analyses to examine metabolically driven daily individual consumption rates, resulting in a suite of feasible parameter-pair ranges for each of three taxonomic groups: mysticetes, odontocetes, and pinnipeds. We expanded daily individual consumption to annual consumption based on abundance estimates of marine mammals found on the NEUS continental shelf coupled with estimates of annual residence time for each species. To examine consumptive removals for specific prey, diet compositions were summarized into major prey categories, and predatory removals by marine mammal species as well as for total marine mammal consumption were estimated for each prey taxa. Bounds on consumption estimates for each marine mammal species were determined using Monte Carlo resampling simulations. Our results suggest that consumption for these 12 marine mammal species combined may be similar in magnitude to commercial fishery landings for small pelagic and groundfish prey groups. Consumption by marine mammals warrants consideration both as a source of mortality in assessments of prey stocks, and to determine marine mammal forage demands in ecosystem assessment models. The approach that we present represents a rigorous, quantitative method to scope the bounds of the biomass that marine mammals are expected to consume, and is appropriate for use in other ecosystems where the interaction between marine mammals and commercial fisheries is thought to be prominent.

AB  - The Waquoit Bay Watershed ecological risk assessment was performed by an interdisciplinary and inter-agency workgroup. This paper focuses on the steps taken to formulate the analysis plan for this watershed assessment. The workgroup initially conducted a series of meetings with the general public and local and state managers to determine environmental management objectives for the watershed. The workgroup then decided that more information was needed on the impacts of six stressors: nutrient enrichment, physical alteration of habitat, altered freshwater flow, toxic chemicals, pathogens, and fisheries harvesting. Assessment endpoints were selected to establish the link between environmental management objectives, impacts of stressors, and scientifically measurable endpoints. The following assessment endpoints were selected: estuarine eelgrass cover, scallop abundance, finfish diversity and abundance, wetland bird distribution and abundance, piping plover distribution and abundance, tissue contaminant levels, and brook trout distribution and abundance in streams. A conceptual model was developed to show the pathways between human activities, stressors, and ecological effects. The workgroup analyzed comparative risks, by first ranking stressors in terms of their potential risk to biotic resources in the watershed. Then stressors were evaluated by considering the components of stressors (e.g., the stressor chemical pollution included both heavy metals and chlorinated solvents components) in terms of intensity and extensiveness. The workgroup identified nutrient enrichment as the major stressor. Nutrient enrichment comprised both phosphorus enrichment in freshwater ponds and nitrogen enrichment within estuaries. Because phosphorus impacts were being analyzed and mitigated by the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence, this assessment focused on nitrogen. The process followed to identify the predominant stressor and focus the analyses on nitrogen impacts on eelgrass and scallops will serve as an example of how to increase the use of the findings of a watershed assessment in decision making.

AB  - High pedological and geological variability can trigger the formation of REE hotspots, causing a need to optimize the establishment of quality reference values (QRVs). Thus, we determined the background concentrations of REEs in the soils of an emerging Brazilian state and used a combination of Moran's I and indicator kriging to identify REE hotspots and determine QRVs. A total of 100 composite soil samples was collected at a 0.20 m depth to establish background concentrations, QRVs, and spatial distribution and to elaborate probability maps for REEs. The QRVs established for soils were the following (mg kg(-1)): La (27.21), Ce (57.26), Pr (10.49), Nd (24.29), Sm (4.75), Eu (0.90), Gd (4.22), Tb (0.82), Dy (1.54), Ho (0.38), Er (1.23), Yb (1.07), Lu (0.24), Y (10.65), and Sc (3.70). It was possible to draw attention to the Northwest and Southwest regions of the Rio Grande do Norte (RN) state, due to the formation of REE hotspots, indicated by Moran's I, and a high tendency to exceed the QRVs, confirmed by the indicator kriging. The high background concentrations and geochemical patterns for REEs showed that a single QRV for each REE and the entire state can neglect specific environmental characteristics and misrepresent the natural geochemistry of the soil. Thus, specific QRVs were established to optimize the monitoring of natural REE values by identifying hotspot areas. The criteria established here may be useful for other groups of potentially toxic elements, provided that observations meet the requirements of the spatial autocorrelation and kriging analyses.

AB  - Emergy provides a general accounting mechanism that allows us to view the economy and the environment on the same income statement and balance sheet. This allows an auditor to verify the economic picture by checking it against a more complete representation of the flows and storages of real wealth as measured by emergy. In this study, we constructed emergy accounts for the state of West Virginia in 1997. The income statement showed annual production, consumption, and flows of emergy and dollars into and out of the state, The balance sheet evaluated the storage of emergy in some of the state's assets. Emergy indices were used to answer questions posed by managers and gain insight into the state's economic and environmental strengths and weaknesses. West Virginia has great wealth in nonrenewable resources (9E14 sej m(-2) or 17 times the U. S. average). The investment ratio of emergy purchased outside to indigenous renewable and nonrenewable emergy was 2.2:1, which indicates a high potential for future development. However, the environmental loading ratio (14:1) was already 1.5 times higher than that found at an average location in the U.S. Twice as much emergy was exported as received and standard of living indicators showed that people have largely failed to benefit from their state's wealth. We propose that,just as in business, where decisions made using financial accounts ensure solvency; decisions governing the environment should be made based on an emergy accounting of activities, assets, and liabilities for the combined system of humanity and nature.

AB  - The measurement of vitellogenin (vtg) gene transcription has been shown to be a reliable indicator of exposure to estrogenic compounds. Unfortunately, the relatively poor molecular characterization of North American fish species has hindered its application to a larger number of ecologically important species. The current research aimed to demonstrate specific amplification of vtg gene transcripts in three model (zebrafish, rainbow trout, and medaka) and six nonmodel (emerald shiner, pearl dace, smallmouth bass, creek chub, white sucker, and golden redhorse) fish species. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) primers for model species were designed from publicly available vtg sequences. Successful amplification of vtg was demonstrated in fish exposed to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) for all model species. Vitellogenin primers for selected nonmodel species were designed from published sequences of closely related species. Multiple primers were developed targeting different regions of the vtg gene. The successful amplification of vtg was confirmed through size and sequence analysis for all nonmodel species with the exception of the white sucker, in which amplifications failed. Furthermore, QPCR primers and conditions were quantitative over five orders of magnitude in at least one species (pearl dace) exposed to 5 ng/L of EE2 for 24 h. The selected species are found in a wide array of ecological habitats that span the United States. Inclusion of vtg transcriptional analysis for wild, ecologically relevant fish in monitoring studies may aid in understanding the extent of estrogenic exposure in aquatic ecosystems across the United States.

AB  - European Union Directive 2013/39/EU, which amended and updated the Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000/60/EC) and its daughter directive (2008/105/EC), sets Environmental Quality Standards for biota (EQS(biota)) for a number of bioaccumulative chemicals. These chemicals pose a threat to both aquatic wildlife and human health via the consumption of contaminated prey or the intake of contaminated food originating from the aquatic environment. EU member states will need to establish programs to monitor the concentration of 11 priority substances in biota and assess compliance against these new standards for the classification of surface water bodies. An EU-wide guidance effectively addresses the implementation of EQS(biota). Flexibility is allowed in the choice of target species used for monitoring to account for both diversity of habitats and aquatic community composition across Europe. According to that guidance, the consistency and comparability of monitoring data across member states should be enhanced by adjusting the data on biota contaminant concentrations to a standard trophic level by use of the appropriate trophic magnification factor (TMF), a metric of contaminant biomagnification through the food web. In this context, the selection of a TMF value for a given substance is a critical issue, because this field-derived measure of trophic magnification can show variability related to the characteristics of ecosystems, the biology and ecology of organisms, the experimental design, and the statistical methods used for TMF calculation. This paper provides general practical advice and guidance for the selection or determination of TMFs for reliable application within the context of the WFD (i.e., adjustment of monitoring data and EQS derivation).

AB  - In tropical landscapes, vegetation patches with contrasting tree densities are distributed as mosaics. However, the locations of patches and densities of trees within them cannot be predicted by climate models alone. It has been proposed that plant-fire feedbacks drive functional thresholds at a landscape scale, thereby maintaining open (savanna) and closed (forest) communities as two distinct stable states. However, there is little rigorous field evidence for this threshold model. Here we aim to provide support for such a model from a field perspective and to analyze the functional and phylogenetic consequences of fire in a Brazilian savanna landscape (Cerrado). We hypothesize that, in tropical landscapes, savanna and forest are two stable states maintained by plant-fire feedbacks. If so, their functional and diversity attributes should change abruptly along a community closure gradient. We set 98 plots along a gradient from open savanna to closed forest in the Brazilian Cerrado and tested for a threshold pattern in nine functional traits, five soil features, and seven diversity indicators. We then tested whether the threshold pattern was associated with different fire regimes. Most community attributes presented a threshold pattern on the savanna-forest transition with coinciding breakpoints. The thresholds separated two community states: (1) open environments with low-diversity communities growing in poor soils and dominated by plants that are highly resistant to high-intensity fires; and (2) closed environments with highly diverse plant communities growing in more fertile soils and dominated by shade-tolerant species that efficiently prevent light from reaching the understory. In addition, each state was associated with contrasting fire regimes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that forests and savannas are two coexisting stable states with contrasting patterns of function and diversity that are regulated by fire-plant feedbacks; our results also shed light on the mechanism driving each state. Overall, our results support the idea that fire plays an important role in regulating the distribution of savanna and forest biomes in tropical landscapes.

AB  - Mountains are facing strong environmental pressures, which may jeopardize the supply of various ecosystem services. For sustainable land management, ecosystem services and their supporting functions should thus be evaluated and monitored. Satellite products have been receiving growing attention for monitoring ecosystem functioning, mainly due to their increasing temporal and spatial resolutions. Here, we aim to illustrate the high potential of satellite products, combined with ancillary in situ and statistical data, to monitor the current state and trend of ecosystem services in the Peneda-Geres National Park, a protected mountain range in Portugal located in a transition climatic zone (Atlantic to Mediterranean). We focused on three ecosystem services belonging to three broad categories: provisioning (reared animals), regulating (of water flows), and cultural (conservation of an endemic and iconic species). These services were evaluated using a set of different satellite products, namely grassland cover, soil moisture, and ecosystem functional attributes. In situ and statistical data were also used to compute final indicators of ecosystem services. We found a decline in the provision of reared animals since year 2000, although the area of grasslands had remained stable. The regulation of water flows had been maintained, and a strong relationship with interannual precipitation pattern was noted. In the same period, conservation of the focal iconic species might have been affected by interannual fluctuations of suitable habitat areas, with a possible influence of wildfires and precipitation. We conclude that satellite products can efficiently provide information about the current state and trend in the supply of various categories of ecosystem services, especially when combined with in situ or statistical data in robust modeling frameworks.

AB  - Purpose The paper aims to present the results of a study aimed at constructing economic and mathematical models used in decision-making in the management of budget procurement of a region, contributing to the efficient use of budget funds. One of the key problems in this area is the assessment of the quality of procurement Design/methodology/approach One of the key problems in this area is the assessment of the quality of procurement, the solution of which requires the application of economic and mathematical methods, models, tools and algorithms built into information systems for supporting decision-making. The introduction of these systems brings to a qualitatively new level the system of relations between subjects of budget procurement. The paper analyzes modern publications on the implementation of public procurement and related issues of efficiency (savings) of budgetary funds. Findings The indicators on the basis of which the evaluation of the quality of regional procurement is determined are proposed. The architecture of the information system for decision support in the evaluation of procurement quality has been developed. The system has the property of adapting to changes in the state of the environment through the constant accumulation of statistical data characterizing the procurement and adjustment of the parameters of the mathematical model in accordance with them. A mathematical model is built into the control loop that allows ranking the indicators of budget purchases by the degree of their influence on the effective attribute. The role of a functional feature is the quality of budget procurement. The mathematical model is based on the application of the mathematical apparatus of correlation and regression analysis. The impact of each of the factor attributes on the functional attribute has been assessed. Originality/value The mathematical model is based on the application of the mathematical apparatus of correlation and regression analysis. The impact of each of the factor attributes on the functional attribute has been assessed. Real statistics are given that characterize budget procurements carried out in retrospect. The coefficients of the linear regression model are determined based on the use of the STATISTICA application software package. The proposed decision support information system with a regression model built into it allows one to make scientifically and quantitatively sound decisions when assessing the quality of budget purchases of a region.

AB  - Concern about soil physical quality has grown in recent years, particularly in view of serious problems caused by intensive soil use. We hypothesised that improper soil management in irrigated areas damages the structure of sensitive soils in some regions in North-eastern Brazil. The aim of the study was to evaluate the physical quality of irrigated soils planted with annual and perennial crops, compared with soils under natural vegetation in Ceara State, Brazil. Measurements were made of least limiting water range (LLWR), the S index, and relative density. Undisturbed soil samples were collected at two depths (5-10 and 20-25 cm) in four cultivated areas (banana, guava, pasture, and maize/bean in succession) and two natural vegetation areas (NV1, NV2) adjacent to the cultivated areas. All sites were in the Jaguaribe-Apodi Irrigated District, Limoeiro do Norte, Ceara, Brazil. The LLWR was determined using the water retention curve, soil resistance to penetration, and soil bulk density, which are parameters needed to obtain the upper and lower limits of LLWR. The S index was obtained from the water retention curve. The relative density was obtained from the relationship between bulk density and maximum density obtained from the Proctor test. The S index varied as a function of soil management. The variation in LLWR differed between the studied areas as a function of soil bulk density. The relative densities for NV1 and NV2 were lower than for cultivated areas, showing that intensive soil use has caused compaction. The studied parameters seem to be good indicators of soil physical quality, and it was noticed that soils under cultivation suffer an alteration of their structure relative to soils under natural vegetation.

AB  - The aim. The article is devoted to the development of methodological approaches to the strategic management of the development of transport and logistics clusters, which take into account opportunities and barriers, especially the domestic economic environment, as well as the specifics of certain types of economic activity. Methods. The economic and mathematical model is substantiated using the Savage criterion, which gives an opportunity to choose the optimal strategy of transport and logistics cluster development in the domestic conditions of management taking into account the different expectations of business entities. Methods similar to the Wald, Bayesian and Savage criteria were used for choosing optimal strategies in decision making theory and optimization problems of the following types were solved: when the distribution of states of the environment is unknown and assumed to be the most unfavourable; when it is known empirical expected distribution of environmental conditions and that is the average expected performance level for each indicator's group; when it is known expected division of the priorities of the decision-making entity that is the average expected level of financial (organizational, etc.) support for a certain group of indicators. Results. Four types of "clean" cluster development strategies are identified and described, which can be used in various combinations by transport and logistics companies. The economic and mathematical model of the transport and logistics cluster performance is presented, which allows implementing a large number of combinations of types of cluster development strategy by taking economic, environmental, social and innovative measures, affecting different groups of performance indicators. The influence of all possible variants of the binary and ternary combination of different types of transport and logistics cluster development strategies on the cluster performance is considered. It is established that the greatest influence on the transport and logistics cluster performance is exerted by the combination of economic and innovative types of strategy. Practical significance. Given the interest of entrepreneurs in cluster forms of organization and the strengthening of cooperation with EU countries, present development promotes scientific approaches to modelling cluster development strategies in the economy of Ukraine. Relevance/originality. The developed simulation model increases the likelihood of implementing the most optimal combination of clean" development strategies, contributes to a more accurate prediction of cluster development and as a methodological approach can be applied to various types of economic activity.

AB  - The purpose of writing the article is to highlight main types of media planning indexes and to classify them.
   The results of the analysis. Actual media indexes cannot be used while planning advertising campaign, until they are calculated after advertisement is shown. This explains why indexes are applied based on historical data (from previous periods) and forecasts (anticipated indexes) when media is selected. Two types of media indexes such as quantitative and qualitative are extracted depending on description of contents.
   Like all values, indexes of media planning can be divided into absolute and relative, depending on the method of calculation and measuring units used. Absolute means no comparison with anything. In addition, this type characterizes the magnitude of a statistical population and its indexes are always named (seconds, hryvnia, etc.). The advantage of relative indexes lies in the fact that they allow the comparison of variety of values. These indexes calculated by collation of absolute and average values or both and are presented as coefficients or percentages. In some cases, it is possible to use both forms. Taking into account the process of formation, we can also derive calculated, measured and conventional as separate types of media indexes, as it determines the complexity of the process and distinguishes the functional purpose.
   Majority of indexes are versatile and are applicable in different advertising campaigns with media mixes. Some of them are specialized, i.e. designed to be used only in particular type of advertisements, like TV advertising. The variability of the ways the indexes form and notated allows to differentiate indexes further into natural (a person, a second, etc.), monetary (hryvnia, dollar, etc.) and relative units (coefficients and percentages) according to the units of measurement.
   Depending on the purpose and conditions of application which differ by the objects of study, numbers and quantity of arithmetical operations, indexes are divided into individual (e.g. rating), gross (e.g. gross rating points), and mean (e.g. frequency of advertising campaign). Not only quantity of arithmetical operations, but also their nature causes differences between media indexes, which therefore can be primary and derivative (the first one determines the second). Besides that, media indexes have number of functions, thus divided into planning, controlling, evaluative and selling. Media indexes are compared with one another when studying changes in their values in time, giving us basic (comparable) and current (compared) indexes, which depends on application in dynamics analysis.
   Some indexes accumulate over time. These can be divided into two groups: cumulative (value may increase) andnoncumulative (the result cannot stack up). The influence of time factor also determines the agility of values of media indexes, which by this trait break down into dynamic (the majority of indexes) and static or relatively static - these values do not change or change only in special cases. The level of detail of target audience determines the next batch of indexes in media planning: generalized (characterize the audience in general), target (define only relevant part of general audience) and exclusive (present specific audience of particular media channel). Also, depending on territory of evaluation media indexes are divided into global, national, regional and local. The calculation of media indexes includes one or several evaluation factors. Consequently, based on the quantity of these factors we can define simple and complicated type of indexes.
   Conclusions and prospects of further research. The need to classify media indexes, used as criterions in advertising planning, is determined by their significance in the managerial decisions, necessity to find the ways to optimize expenses and unify estimating procedures of advertising efficiency. Variety of media indexes characteristics gives the possibility to classify them by such attributes as stage of advertising planning, characteristic of content, method of calculation and measurement units, process of formation, field of application, measurement units, number of arithmetical operations and objects gauged, derivation, role, application in dynamics analysis, period of the figures accounting, accumulation property, influence of time factor, level of detail of target audience, territory of evaluation, quantity of accounting factors.
   The prospects of further study in this field is determined by importance of practical use of presented classification and the necessity to adopt it into education process of advertising specialists with goal to speed up the exchange of data and facilitate communications between different market entities.

AB  - Gulf Menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) are a species of commercial and ecological importance in the northern Gulf of Mexico, provisioning the second largest fishery by weight, in the United States, and providing critical ecosystem services in the coastal region. The recruitment and productivity dynamics of the stock are influenced by a suite of environmental factors but an understanding of the factors that determine individual variation in oil content (an indicator of an individual's commercial value to the fishery and its dietary value to predators) has not been well described. In this work I describe the temporal dynamics of oil content and determine the demographic characteristics that provide predictive power to describe annual contrasts. I relate the predicted patterns in oil yield to a suite of seasonal environmental data series including: the magnitude of spring Mississippi River discharge, spring wind vectors, and the preceding winter El Nino conditions. Two uncorrelated (r = 0.06, p = 0.81) population-level predictor variables were identified that have explanatory power to describe temporal patterns in oil content (L kg(-1)); a weight-at-length power function parameter (a) and the von Bertalanffy asymptotic fork length (L-infinity, mm FL): L kg(-1) = -0.158 -0.026*a -0.00163*L-infinity (p < 0.05, R-2 = 0.42). Analysis of the impacts of environmental variables on the oil content of Gulf Menhaden was evaluated comprehensively in a Bayesian framework by transforming the observed oil content information from two sources to a common scale. Parameters relating oil content to spring Mississippi River discharge and the preceding winter (December February) El Nino Southern Oscillation index resulted in sample distributions from the posterior where zero was outside the 95% credible interval. This work contributes to the understanding of Gulf Menhaden as a prey species in the Gulf of Mexico and indicates that the value of the species to both the fishery and predators exhibits relatively large inter-annual variability controlled, in part, by seasonal environmental conditions.

AB  - 1. An animal's elemental composition can be an important indicator of its physiological state and role in ecosystem nutrient cycling. We examined the interactive effects of bacterial (Pasteuria ramosa) infection and phosphorus (P)-poor food on the body stoichiometry of Daphnia magna. Daphnia were exposed to or held free of a bacterial parasite and fed algal food of different C:P ratios (100-500) over a 28-day period.
   2. To assess the effects of exposure and infection on Daphnia stoichiometry, we measured their whole body content of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and P on four different days (4, 8, 15, and 28) during the experiment.
   3. We found strong effects of infection, food quality, and/or their interactions on the C, N, and P content of Daphnia, especially as the infectious disease progressed. At the end of the experiment, infected animals had significantly more C and less P in their bodies than uninfected conspecifics. Body N content of Daphnia consuming P-rich food was reduced by bacterial infection whereas Daphnia consuming P-poor algae showed increased body N content from infection.
   4. Using a mass-balance model, we found that changes in N and P content of host bodies were largely accountable by disease-induced alterations to Daphnia reproduction (i.e. bacterial induced sterility) and the accumulation of Pasteuria spores in the body cavity. Our calculations also show that the observed increase in host C content could not be accounted for by loss of eggs or accumulation of bacterial spores. This instead must result from unidentified changes to underlying daphnid tissue C content.
   5. These results demonstrate that intraspecific variation in zooplankton body stoichiometry can be caused by exposure to and infection by bacterial parasites. In addition, these effects were found to depend both upon the stage of the disease and upon the food quality consumed by the host.

AB  - Purpose. The problem of environmental pollution by heavy metals is one of the most important problems of the present and the near future. The compounds of these elements are characterized by high toxicity, mobility and ability to bio-accumulation. The aim of the study was to establish the main regularities of trace elements of the national natural park (NNP), to determine the indicators of their mobility for assessment of state of environment.
   Scientific novelty. The article discusses the features of distributing of heavy metals in the components of landscapes of the territory of the national natural park for realization of control and settlement of his concentration in accordance with the set norms.
   Results. The analysis of the landscape-geochemical conditions of the territory of the national natural park "Nyzhniosulskyi" has been performed. Consistent patterns of heavy metals distribution in the modern soil of the territory of NNP "Nyzhniosulskyi" have been determined. The analysis of landscape-geochemical conditions of the territory indicates that they generally contribute to the migration of chemical elements with land runoff as well as their significant vertical redistribution. The differentiation of landscape-geochemical conditions causes the fixation and accumulation of a significant number of natural and man-made chemical elements on the landscape-geochemical barriers (mechanical, redox, acid-alkaline, sorption, sorption-gley). This prevents from intense pollution of the vast majority of landscape regions in the park by polluting substances migrating from agricultural lands, which is confirmed by the results of the analysis of pollution sources and volumes.
   It was shown, that processes of transformation and migration of heavy metals compounds in the soil profile are determined by physical and chemical properties of soils.The analysis of the content of heavy metals in the soils of NNP "Nyzhniosulskyi" has shown that, the distribution of heavy metals is uniformly dispersive, but the variations in the content of certain heavy metals can range from +/- 7% to +/- 25%-35%. The greatest bioaccumulation capacity is expressed in biogenic microelements - manganese and cuprum.
   The analysis of heavy metals content in the landscape regions of NNP "Nyzhniosulskyi" has confirmed its dependence on available sources of technogenic contamination as well as the high degree of compliance of the nature of heavy metals distribution to the general laws of these processes in the soils of the relevant types. Most heavy metals get into the Sulyn aquatorium mainly during spring flood with snow melt water. The excess of Cd2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+ in water has been noted in comparison with the current threshold level value regulations.
   According to the results of the landscape-geochemical analysis of the NNP "Nyzhniosulskyi", it can be stated that the territory from the ecological point of view is poorly contaminated and can be used for the development of recreational activities in compliance with a number of requirements.
   Practical significance. The results of this study have been introduced into practice of the NNP "Nyzhniosulskyi" in organizing and conducting research work, for planning tourist and recreational activities, forming tourist routes, and organizing recreational infrastructure.

AB  - The condition and trend of 196 marine environment components were assessed for Australia's national 2011 State of the Environment Report using professional judgements derived by expert elicitation. The judgements from the diverse group of field-experienced scientists and practitioners were assembled within a single framework common to all components to provide an integrated system-level assessment. Components assessed included the natural environmental assets and values in biodiversity, ecosystem health, and the pressures. A high level of agreement was achieved amongst the disciplines and experts on the decision structure and the scores or grades, even though many components are data-poor at the national scale. The assessment confirmed the clear association between human development history and extant condition of the biodiversity and ecosystem health. Overall, the marine environment was considered to be in good condition relative to conditions prior to European colonisation of the Australian mainland. However, more components of the biodiversity were considered to be deteriorating than improving, inferring that the overall quality of ecosystems is in decline. Combined present-day pressures were considered to be greatest in the temperate and the coastal waters (<200 m depth) adjacent to more developed areas of the coast in the South-east region. Here, condition of biodiversity and ecosystem health was considered to be poor, and in some places very poor. Condition in the North region, where there is only limited human development, was considered to be good. The process identified environmental components considered to be in the 'best of the best' and 'worst of the worst' condition, providing focus for subsequent prioritisation in national environment policies. Gaps identified include a lack of national-scale data on the condition and trend in almost all biodiversity components other than fished species, for which most knowledge is skewed towards resource use. Also, there is a lack of monitoring of the links between national pressures, such as port development, and regional biodiversity condition in response to policy settings and management activity. The assessment process deployed here provides a model for repeatable integrated system-level assessment and reporting at the national and regional scales in data-poor marine situations.

AB  - Over the course of 16 d in the fall of 1998, Hurricane Georges made landfall on five Caribbean Island nations, two U.S. states, and two territories. Along its path, it impacted nearly every type of built environment and terrestrial and marine ecosystem found in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. We reviewed ecological and sociological research related to Georges in order to demonstrate the potential power of regional synoptic networks despite notable gaps that existed at the time. Most studies examined various effects and responses within four years of the storm, though a few reported longer-term results. Reduction in forest stem density was the most reported ecological effect and ranged from 7% to 51% among sites in different forest types. Forests previously impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 showed lower mortality from Georges than forests with longer hurricane-free intervals. Rivers in the storm's path exported heavy loads of sediment to marine systems. For example, 5-10 million tons of sediment was transported to marine systems from Puerto Rico, and suspended sediments increased tenfold in coastal Louisiana. Economic costs directly related to Hurricane Georges ranged from 5% to 200% of annual GDP in the year after the storm. Sociological research indicated that children and college students exposed to Hurricane Georges experienced elevated effects on mental health such as anxiety and depression for up to 2.5 yr. Established research areas and longitudinal studies were valuable in understanding hurricane effects in the context of long-term trends but fragmented research capacity reduced both local and regional synthetic efforts. Georges provides a template of how future integrated research programs could provide a deeper understanding of how nature, urbanization, human culture, and societal norms interact, respond, and recover from a major hurricane. However, future studies should avoid using the Saffir-Simpson scale as a shorthand indicator or predictor of storm effects because topographic, historical, ecological, political, infrastructural, and societal factors interact to alter storm effects. The breadth of topics addressed in the research produced after Georges shows the potential for transformative, regionally synthetic research that spans whole watersheds and nearshore areas while integrating ecological and social sciences.

AB  - In Mediterranean regions, afforested areas were planted to ensure the permanence of land cover, and to protect against erosion and to initiate the vegetation processes. For those purposes, pine species were mainly used; however, many of these stands, without silvicultural treatments for over fifty-sixty years, were in a poor state from physical and biological perspective, and therefore, clear-cutting on strips was conducted as silvicultural operation with the aim to eliminate 50% of the pine trees and to favor the affirmation of indigenous broadleaves seedlings. At the same time, the high and increasing demand of the forest based sector for wood biomass related to energy production, needs to be supplied. In a modern and multifunctional forestry, in which society is asking for sustainable forestry and naturalistic forest management, forestry operations should ideally be carried out in a sustainable manner, thus support the concept of sustainable forest management. All these aspects are also related to the innovation in forestry sector for an effective energetic sustainability. Three different forest wood chains were applied in pine plantations, all differing in the extraction system (animal, forestry-fitted farm tractor with winch, and double drum cable yarder). The method of the sustainability impact assessment was used in order to assess potential impacts of these alternative management options, and a set of 12 indicators covering economic, environmental, and social dimensions was analyzed. Further, to support decision makers in taking informed decisions, multi-criteria decision analysis was conducted. Decision makers gave weight towards the indicators natural tree regeneration and soil biological quality to support the achievement of the forest management goal. Results showed that first ranked alternative was case 2, in which extraction was conducted by a tractor with a winch. The main reason for that lies in the fact that this alternative had best performance for 80% of the analyzed criteria.

AB  - Recent studies on applications of the information theoretic concepts to molecular systems are reviewed. This survey covers the information theory basis of the Hirshfeld partitioning of molecular electron densities, its generalization to many electron probabilities, the local information distance analysis of molecular charge distributions, the charge transfer descriptors of the donor-acceptor reactive systems, the elements of a "thermodynamic" description of molecular charge displacements, both "vertical" (between molecular fragments for the fixed overall density) and "horizontal" (involving different molecular densities), with the entropic representation description provided by the information theory. The average uncertainty measures of bond multiplicities in molecular "communication" systems are also briefly summarized. After an overview of alternative indicators of the information distance (entropy deficiency, missing information) between probability distributions the properties of the "stockholder" densities, which minimize the entropy deficiency relative to the promolecule reference, are summarized. In particular, the surprisal analysis of molecular densities is advocated as an attractive information-theoretic tool in the electronic structure theory, supplementary to the familiar density difference diagrams. The subsystem information density equalization rules satisfied by the Hirshfeld molecular fragments are emphasized: the local values of alternative information distance densities of subsystems are equal to the corresponding global value, characterizing the molecule as a whole. These local measures of the information content are semi-quantitatively related to the molecular density difference function. In the density functional theory the effective external potentials of molecular fragments are defined, for which the subsystem densities are the ground- state densities. The nature of the energetic and "entropic" equilibrium conditions is reexamined and the entropy representation forces driving the charge transfer in molecular systems are introduced. The latter combine the familiar Fukui functions of subsystems with the information densities, the entropy representation "intensive" conjugates of the subsystem electron densities, and are shown to exactly vanish for the "stockholder" charge distribution. The proportionality relations between charge response characteristics of reactants, e.g., the Fukui functions, are derived. They are shown to follow from the minimum entropy deficiency principles formulated in terms of both the subsystems electron densities and Fukui functions, respectively.

AB  - Exposure to radiation is a potential hazard to humans and the environment. The Fukushima accident reminded the world of the importance of a reliable risk management system that incorporates the dose received from radiation exposures. The dose to humans from exposure to radiation can be quantified using a well-defined system; its environmental equivalent, however, is still in a developmental state. Additionally, the results of several papers published over the last decade have been criticized because of poor dosimetry. Therefore, a workshop on environmental dosimetry was organized by the STAR (Strategy for Allied Radioecology) Network of Excellence to review the state of the art in environmental dosimetry and prioritize areas of methodological and guidance development. Herein, we report the key findings from that international workshop, summarise parameters that affect the dose animals and plants receive when exposed to radiation, and identify further research needs. Current dosimetry practices for determining environmental protection are based on simple screening dose assessments using knowledge of fundamental radiation physics, source-target geometry relationships, the influence of organism shape and size, and knowledge of how radionuclide distributions in the body and in the soil profile alter dose. In screening model calculations that estimate whole-body dose to biota the shapes of organisms are simply represented as ellipsoids, while recently developed complex voxel phantom models allow organ specific dose estimates. We identified several research and guidance development priorities for dosimetry. For external exposures, the uncertainty in dose estimates due to spatially heterogeneous distributions of radionuclide contamination is currently being evaluated. Guidance is needed on the level of dosimetry that is required when screening benchmarks are exceeded and how to report exposure in dose-effect studies, including quantification of uncertainties. Further research is needed to establish whether and how dosimetry should account for differences in tissue physiology, organism life stages, seasonal variability (in ecology, physiology and radiation field), species life span, and the proportion of a population that is actually exposed.

TI  - EXPERIENCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE AXIOLOGICAL WORLD IMAGE IN PHRASEOLOGY: A STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION (BASED ON RUSSIAN, UKRAINIAN, ENGLISH AND GERMAN)

AB  - The article is devoted to the reconstruction of the axiological world image (AWI) with the actualization of its structural organization in phraseology on the material of Russian, Ukrainian, English and German. The AWI is positioned as an understanding by a person of the world, fragments of this world and the status of the person in this world through an assessment categorization of values and non-values in opposition.
   The object of the study is the AWI in phraseology. The subject of the study is phraseological units representing values. The description of values is realized using the method of parametric analysis of the semantic structure of the phraseological unit (PhU) with the accentuation of the estimated macrocomponent, and the method of thematic fields, that is, through phraseosemantic fields, groups and subgroups. Phraseological axiological opposition is interpreted as the unity of the two blocks represented by PhUs: the first consists of PhUs, the semantics of which correlates with values, and the second of PhUs whose semantics correlates with non-values.
   This methodology allows outlining the parametric model of the AWI and establish the value orientations of a person /ethnos in phraseology: freedom (29.1%), health (27.4%), family (10.7%), money (9.2%), success (5.9%), love (4.7%), honesty (3.4%), law (3%), friendship (1.9%), peace (1.7%), beauty (1.5%), justice (1.5%). The quantitative indicators of PhUs that represent the value determine the importance of the value. Thus, the most significant values in the Russian AWI are health and freedom, in Ukrainian freedom and health, in English success, freedom and health, in German money, freedom and health. In the ethnoses under consideration, social values dominate, which proves the relevance of the "human - society" format to the individual.
   Phraseological universals of the AWI structure are determined by the associative character of human thinking and are associated with the psychophysiological features of a person, categories of space and time, appearance and habits of animals, sensual image of color and symbolic meanings of color, fixed in world practice; typical characteristics of phenomena and states of nature. Differences in the AWI are due to the national specificity of culture (way of life, perception of the environment, etc.) of the speakers of the compared languages. The analysis of the value structure shows that values express the phenomenon of personal and social significance, thus confirming the thesis of the uniqueness of the perception of value, of experiencing it by a separate subject (the speaker of a certain language in the research), of filling it with socially significant meaning (universal in the research), which personifies the existence of the unique and the common in the AWI.
   The prospect of research lies in revealing pragmatic features of the social, vital, legal, moral, aesthetic, material levels of the AWI in the phraseology of various languages with the establishment of correlative and non-correlative zones.

AB  - This review examines a large marine continental shelf ecosystem (the Eastern Scotian Shelf of Canada (ESS)), that has undergone dramatic hysteresis-like changes in the recent past, using a pragmatic approach that combines empirical, reductionist and holistic methods based on the integrated analysis of 55 primary and secondary biotic, abiotic, and human variables over a 43-year period. The integrated analysis reveals that the ESS ecosystem has changed states, i.e., a,regime shift' from a community dominated by large-bodied demersal fish to one dominated by small dernersal and pelagic fish species and benthic macroinvertebrates. A dynamic interplay between ocean physics, biology and exploitation presents a more realistic casual scenario than any single component hypothesis such as fishing pressure alone. The forces contributing to the stability of the alternate state include both top-down processes involving strong trophic interactions initiated at the apex predator level and bottom-up processes involving energy flow and nutrient cycling that have fundamentally altered the matter and energy flow patterns in the ESS ecosystem. It is suggested that the ESS has been literally 'devolving' when viewed from the perspective of the theory of ecological succession. Further, higher-order variables are identified as early warning indicators, sensitive to the underlying structural and functional changes that occurred on the ESS ecosystem. They have been determined for an adjacent system where systemic changes have not yet been observed and predict a potential collapse within a decade.
   Integrated assessment of ecosystems is a great challenge and their management requires comprehension of ecological systems. Description alone is not sufficient to allow comprehension, especially if 'information overload' (the disconnect between system description and system comprehension) is to be avoided and meaningful insights and strategies are to emerge. Reductionistic analysis involves the dissection and identification of key processes or feedback mechanisms likely to be operative in an ecological system. However, value cannot be ascertained from variations in processes, as a directionality of time does not exist in such a perspective. In fact, the approach has accelerated the information overload experienced by all stakeholders. Holistic approaches are being increasingly used to aid in the valuation of ecological systems as the directionality of time is made explicit in this perspective. It is suggested that integrated assessment requires not only the integration of descriptive information, but also the integration of our perception of ecological systems as being both a whole and a part.

AB  - Simple Summary Among the many species threatened with extinction and covered by protection of species is bitterling Rhodeus amarus. It belongs to ostracophilic fish that place spawn inside live mussels. Bitterlings, such as mussels, belongs to indicator species that testify to the good state of the natural environment. Supporting the populations of these organisms is a necessity in order to preserve the biodiversity of inland waters, which are subjected to severe anthropopression. The development in advance of a method of reproduction and breeding of bitterling under controlled conditions can ensure their survival in the event of an imbalance in the natural environment. These were the first studies of this type, where after 6.5 months of rearing, sexually mature individuals were obtained. In this way, a suitable stocking material of the bitterling was obtained in order to save the endangered populations. Among the several dozen European freshwater fish species, only European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus Bloch) and Rhodeus meridionalis belong to the group of ostrakophilous fish. The embryonic and larval development of the fish in this reproductive group until the time of the yolk sac resorption takes place in the gill cavity of river mussels (Anodonta sp. or Unio sp.). This paper presents the results of the European bitterling Rhodeus amarus being reared under controlled conditions. Bitterling larvae were caught together with river mussels in the natural environment and subsequently placed in a tank for behavioural observations. Bitterling larvae were seen swimming in the water within a week of placing the bivalves under controlled conditions. The bitterling larvae were 8.6 +/- 0.11 mm long when they started to swim actively. The rearing was conducted in water at 20 and 26 +/- 0.5 degrees C and lasted for 6.5 months (200 days) in both variants. Initially, the larvae were fed with live nauplii of Artemia salina and subsequently with fodder. The bitterlings in tanks with water at 26 +/- 0.5 degrees C were 66.2 +/- 3.0 mm long and weighed 3389 +/- 548 mg. For comparison, bitterlings kept in water at 20 +/- 0.5 degrees C were 64.48 +/- 3.4 mm long and weighed 3242 +/- 427 mg. No larval malformities or mortality were observed during the larvae and fry rearing. The bitterlings had well-developed secondary sexual characteristics and exhibited pre-spawning behaviour at the end of the rearing. This produced suitable bitterling stocking material to be used in the conservation of small or endangered populations.

AB  - The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive depends, for effective implementation, on Member States (MSs) agreeing to a concept of the unimpacted "reference" state, which will then provide the "expected" value in Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) calculations. Reference assemblages of organism groups will, in turn, vary, due to geological, hydrological, climatic, physicochemical and biological factors. Member States tackle this by establishing "types" which share common characteristics. However, for the purposes of ensuring consistent application, broad transboundary types were also established within five Geographical Intercalibration Groups (GIGs, referred to here as "regions") as part of the EU's intercalibration exercise. In this paper, we evaluate these types using river diatom assemblages and also provide reference threshold values for two common metrics used in pan-European diatom assessments. A database was assembled, representing 14 EU Member States from Ireland and Portugal in the West, to Estonia and Cyprus in the East, in order to explore biogeographical patterns in assemblages unaffected by anthropogenic pressures. Multivariate analyses were used to examine this pattern and its relationship with geographic, typological and abiotic parameters. After taxonomic harmonisation, NMDS ordination of samples indicated weak differences in assemblage composition among regions. ANOSIM analyses, in turn indicated that MS was the best factor to group similar samples whereas alkalinity, recognised as the primary environmental variable structuring diatom communities, although significant, explained less variability in the dataset. This, we believe, reflects the importance of methodological factors other than taxonomy (e.g. counting protocol, sample season) that may be constant within a MS but which vary between MSs. When two diatom metrics, the TI and IPS, were applied to the data, differences in the distribution of the metric scores between MS were generally not statistically significant even though some differences between regions were apparent. A trend of increasing values of TI (decreasing values of IPS) was observed in the sequence: Nordic < Alpine < Mediterranean < Central-Baltic < Eastern Continental regions. Additionally, some differences were observed among types within the Mediterranean and Nordic regions, though not for other regions. The data used in this exercise provides us with a region and, in some cases, a type specific benchmark dataset against which national reference data can be compared. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the context of an ongoing monitoring study on the impacts of gold-mining activities on critical ecosystem processes, we explored the use of soil Denitrifying Enzyme Activity (DEA) and Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR) as ecosystem indicators in tropical rainforests of French Guiana. We also propose DEA/SIR ratio as ecosystem attribute able to describe the state of an ecosystem and to reflect changes in ecological processes. With this purpose, we measured SIR, DEA and DEA/SIR ratio in five gold-mining areas and five surrounding natural reference rainforests. We also measured indicators in two conditions of spontaneous regeneration of vegetation (stratified or not) and two conditions of soil rehabilitation (prior preparation of soils or not). We showed a high variability of DEA, SIR and DEA/SIR ratio in the natural reference forests. This pointed out the necessity to identify relevant reference systems - i.e. proving a close match in all relevant ecological dimensions - to compare with closed perturbed systems in order to assess the levels of alterations after disturbances. Results showed a high impact of gold mine on microbial processes with a strong decrease of DEA (10-fold lower), SIR (2-fold lower) and DEA/SIR ratio (8-fold lower) in perturbed areas in comparison with natural reference forests. The type of spontaneous vegetation (stratified or not) influenced the values of indicators as well as prior rehabilitation of soils, demonstrating the capacity of DEA. SIR and DEA/SIR ratio to respond in proportion to the perturbation (robustness) and to the different levels of restoration (sensitivity). The systematic decrease of the ratio DEA/SIR observed in the studied perturbed situations demonstrates clearly that the structure of microbial communities has been also modified. The ratio DEA/SIR proved to be robust and sensitive, and able to describe in fairly fine way changes of soil microbial communities in terms of structure and function in gold mine areas and during processes of restoration. We propose to use DEA, SIR and DEA/SIR ratio as bioindicators of both structural and functional aspects of C and N cycling in soils. Together with others bioindicators based on key supporting functions in soils, these indicators should accurately evaluate the ecological potential of natural ecosystems and the levels of degradation in case of land-use changes.

AB  - Traditional monitoring of biodiversity has focused on the abundance or distribution of individual species, or on simple summary indices of average trends or diversity or species richness. Supplementing these approaches with an index system that measures subtle changes in assemblage structure is highly desirable and appears not to have been previously attempted. Subject to validation, such indices could inform sensitively about ecosystem health (defined as proximity to a stable or desired state) and the natural capital status or potential ecosystem service delivery.
   The available approaches for monitoring biological assemblages and the data to which they might be applied are reviewed, including consideration of sources of error. A particularly promising method is the calculation of 'diversity profiles' (Leinster & Cobbold, 2012), which present a 'signature' describing the range of biological variation, considering both species' identities and their relative abundances.
   The diversity profile approach was tested using a long-term bird monitoring data set for woodland birds in the UK, applying species similarities based on phylogeny, habitat selection and ecological function (i.e. diet). Tests were conducted using three nested sets of species with different levels of specialization with respect to woodland. The influence of quantifiable sources of error was evaluated using bootstrapping.
   Profile shape and temporal changes in diversity varied in magnitude and pattern with the choice of similarity measure and species set, with the pattern of temporal change in diversity showing either an increase or a decline, depending on the choice of analysis. This shows that the profile approach has the potential to reveal subtle variations in assemblage structure, although careful application and interpretation of outputs are required. The bootstrapping results revealed that uncertainty in profile values was high, but that this was due chiefly to uncertainty in interspecific similarities, as opposed to sampled abundance values, but this relates to the specific application to the datasets tested, rather than to the method in general.
   Different approaches to quantifying differences between species (phylogenetic, habitat preference and dietary) revealed different aspects of assemblage variability.
   Combined with the calculation of reference levels of diversity for known assemblages or sets of conditions such that observed variation can be interpreted quantitatively, assemblage monitoring via diversity profiles could add valuable, quantitative inference to ongoing monitoring, and hence the assessment of ecosystem health, potentially bridging the gap between conservation and a purely economic valuation of the status of natural capital.

AB  - * This paper provides an overview of the last 40 years of use, and in many cases abuse, of the natural resources in Catalonia, a country that is representative of European countries in general, and especially those in the Mediterranean region. It analyses the use of natural resources made by mining, agriculture, livestock, logging, fishing, nature tourism, and energy production and consumption. This use results in an ecological footprint, i.e., the productive land and sea surface required to generate the consumed resources and absorb the resulting waste, which is about seven times the amount available, a very high number but very similar to other European countries. This overexploitation of natural resources has a huge impact on land and its different forms of cover, air, and water. For the last 25 years, forests and urban areas have each gained almost 3% more of the territory at the expense of agricultural land; those municipalities bordering the sea have increased their number of inhabitants and activity, and although they only occupy 6.7% of the total surface area, they account for 43.3% of the population; air quality has stabilized since the turn of the century, and there has been some improvement in the state of aquatic ecosystems, but still only 36% are in good condition, while the remainder have suffered morphological changes and different forms of nonpoint source pollution; meanwhile the biodiversity of flora and fauna remains still under threat. Environmental policies do not go far enough so there is a need for revision of the legislation related to environmental impact and the protection of natural areas, flora, and fauna. The promotion of environmental research must be accompanied by environmental education to foster a society which is more knowledgeable, has more control and influence over the decisions that deeply affect it. Indeed, nature conservation goes hand in hand with other social and economic challenges that require a more sustainable vision. Today's problems with nature derive from the current economic model, which is environmentally unsustainable in that it does not take into account environmental impacts. Lastly, we propose a series of reasonable and feasible priority measures and actions related to each use made of the country's natural resources, to the impacts they have had, and to their management, in the hope that these can contribute to improving the conservation and management of the environment and biodiversity and move towards sustainability.

AB  - The broad soil and ecosystem diversity of the state of Roraima is gradually being replaced by pasture and, depending on the management system adopted, this can be associated with soil physical degradation. Within this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the soil physical attributes of an Argissolo Amarelo (Ultisol) under savanna and forest natural ecosystems, and their conversion into a cattle pasture system. The primary treatments were natural savanna (NS), savanna converted to pasture (CS), natural forest (NF) and forest converted to pasture (CF). The secondary treatments were the soil sampling depths of 0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm. The following physical properties were evaluated: texture, bulk density (SD) and particle density (PD), resistance to penetration (PR), total porosity (TP), gravimetric moisture (GM), available water capacity (AWC), and soil organic matter (SOM). The SD was greater in both savanna areas, without differences between CS and NS at any depth, associated with the cohesive character of savanna soils. The average PD value was typical of kaolinite soils. PR varied as a function of the areas and the depths; the effect of conversion on this property was observed. TP was greater in NF and less in CS, and TP decreased along with depth. AWC was greater in NF only at the 0-10 cm depth. SOM was greater in the NF and CF areas. The study concluded that conversion of the natural environment into pasture systems caused significant changes in PR, SD, AWC, TP and SOM, with major expressiveness in CF, due to the removal of natural vegetation, leading to the loss of SOM, which is an important conditioner of soil physical and water properties. In CS areas, suppression of the natural vegetation did not lead to the same expressiveness, mainly due to the significantly lower SOM contents.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse changes in the physicochemical elements in groundwater in the vicinity of a small municipal solid waste landfill site located within the territory of the European Union on the basis of 7-year hydrochemical research. Samples of groundwater and leachate near the examined landfill were collected four times a year during two periods, between 2008 and 2012 during the use of the landfill and between 2013 and 2014 at the stage of its closure. The research results were analysed on the basis of general physicochemical properties: pH; total organic carbon (TOC); electrical conductivity (EC); inorganic elements: Cr, Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, Hg; and one organic elementpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The analysis was carried out in accordance with the EU and national legislation requirements regarding landfill monitoring. The assessment of the groundwater and analysis indicators of the leachate pollution allowed interpretation of the impact of the municipal solid waste landfill on the state of the water environment in the immediate vicinity. The results show that the increased values of Cd, EC, and TOC turned out to be the determinants of the negative impact of leachate on the groundwater quality below the landfill. The integrated water threat model determined the potential negative impact of a landfill site. The extent depended on local environmental conditions and the self-cleaning process. Deterioration of the chemical status in the quality of the groundwater within the landfill area was a consequence of the lack of efficiency of the existing drainage system, which may result from the 19-year period of its use. The applied correlation relationship between physicochemical elements between leachate and groundwater with a time shift due to the extended time of migration of contaminants or mass transfer in waterlogged ground can be an important tool to identify the threat of groundwater pollution in the area of landfill sites.

TI  - Issues in health monitoring intelligent infrastructure
T2  - SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES
LA  - English
AB  - The US Federal Reserve Board has concluded that the failure of civil infrastructure systems to perform at their expected level may reduce the national gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 1%. Intelligent-infrastructure systems and components hold promise for improving performance with an excellent cost/benefit ratio. A recent National Science Foundation (NSF) workshop demonstrated the state of the art in research and applications on intelligent materials and structures in Japan and the US. Major investments have been made by the leading Japanese construction companies into developments for enabling intelligent-structure applications for mitigating earthquake and wind damage. A number of innovative concepts and ideas have been developed by American researchers; however, a lack of applications has also become apparent.
   This paper reports on the research of a multidisciplinary team working at the University of Cincinnati Infrastructure Institute to conceptualize a wide spectrum of issues in infrastructure condition assessment, health monitoring and intelligent systems by conducting exploratory research on actual operating highway bridges, The writers have made much progress towards developing an intelligent-bridge application. Such an application requires advances in sensors, communication and information technology, global non-destructive evaluation technologies of a rigorous and objective nature and fundamental knowledge on state parameters, loading environments, damage and deterioration mechanisms and performance of actual highway bridges. The writers initiated a strong university-government-industry partnership a decade ago and have explored a global condition assessment methodology based on the structural identification concept. After a decade, they have reached an in-depth realization of the complex multisystem identification and integration which must accompany any 'intelligent' systems approach to the infrastructure problem.
   The writers are currently maintaining three 'typical' steel-stringer highway bridge overpasses as generic test-sites for intelligent structures, condition assessment and health monitoring. One of these bridges, which is forty years old, has been decommissioned. This specimen is being tested to understand damage limit-state behavior. Another ten year old specimen has been tested and monitored for five years to understand operating loading environment and behavior at service limit-states. The third bridge is being monitored during its construction to understand the causes and magnitudes of intrinsic forces. After commissioning, this bridge will have a built-in monitor with 300 embedded/attached sensors, a weigh-in-motion scale and sufficient on-site hardware and software to create an intelligent-bridge prototype. By taking advantage of the linkages provided by research at all three test-sites, it has been possible to understand the complete life-cycle spectrum of loading effects and behavior of the medium length steel-stringer bridge type.

AB  - IndiSeas ("Indicators for the Seas") is a collaborative international working group that was established in 2005 to evaluate the status of exploited marine ecosystems using a suite of indicators in a comparative framework. An initial shortlist of seven ecological indicators was selected to quantify the effects of fishing on the broader ecosystem using several criteria (i.e., ecological meaning, sensitivity to fishing, data availability, management objectives and public awareness). The suite comprised: (i) the inverse coefficient of variation of total biomass of surveyed species, (ii) mean fish length in the surveyed community, (iii) mean maximum life span of surveyed fish species, (iv) proportion of predatory fish in the surveyed community, (v) proportion of under and moderately exploited stocks, (vi) total biomass of surveyed species, and (vii) mean trophic level of the landed catch. In line with the Nagoya Strategic Plan of the Convention on Biological Diversity (2011-2020), we extended this suite to emphasize the broader biodiversity and conservation risks in exploited marine ecosystems. We selected a subset of indicators from a list of empirically based candidate biodiversity indicators initially established based on ecological significance to complement the original IndiSeas indicators. The additional selected indicators were: (viii) mean intrinsic vulnerability index of the fish landed catch, (ix) proportion of non-declining exploited species in the surveyed community, (x) catch-based marine trophic index, and (xi) mean trophic level of the surveyed community. Despite the lack of data in some ecosystems, we also selected (xii) mean trophic level of the modelled community, and (xiii) proportion of discards in the fishery as extra indicators. These additional indicators were examined, along with the initial set of IndiSeas ecological indicators, to evaluate whether adding new biodiversity indicators provided useful additional information to refine our understanding of the status evaluation of 29 exploited marine ecosystems. We used state and trend analyses, and we performed correlation, redundancy and multivariate tests. Existing developments in ecosystem-based fisheries management have largely focused on exploited species. Our study, using mostly fisheries independent survey-based indicators, highlights that biodiversity and conservation-based indicators are complementary to ecological indicators of fishing pressure. Thus, they should be used to provide additional information to evaluate the overall impact of fishing on exploited marine ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we present a methodology and a computational tool for performing environmental risk assessments for geo-resource development projects. The main scope is to implement a quantitative model for performing highly specialised multi-hazard risk assessments in which risk pathway scenarios are structured using a bow-tie approach, which implies the integrated analysis of faulttrees and eventtrees. Such a model needs to be defined in the interface between a natural/built/social environment and a geo-resource development activity perturbing it.The methodology presented in this paper is suitable for performing dynamic environmental risk assessments using state-of-the-art knowledge and is characterised by: (1) the bow-tie structure coupled with a wide range of probabilistic models flexible enough to consider different typologies of phenomena; (2) the Bayesian implementation for data assimilation; (3) the handling and propagation of modelling uncertainties; and (4) the possibility of integrating data derived form integrated assessment modelling. Beyond the stochastic models usually considered for reliability analyses, we discuss the integration of physical reliability models particularly relevant for considering the effects of external hazards and/or the interactions between industrial activities and the response of the environment in which such activities are performed. The performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated using a case study focused on the assessment of groundwater pollution scenarios associated with the management of flowback fluids after hydraulically fracturing a geologic formation. The results of the multi-hazard risk assessment are summarised using a risk matrix in which the quantitative assessments (likelihood and consequences) of the different risk pathway scenarios considered in the analysis can be compared. Finally, we introduce an open-access, web-based, service called MERGER, which constitutes a functional tool able to quantitatively evaluate risk scenarios using a bow-tie approach.

AB  - Alga as Achnanthes minutissima among diatoms is a widely adaptable taxon on the state of an aquatic environment. In this study, it was found that diatom had a specific tolerance to heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd etc.) in river water samples, because the diatom assemblage consisted of almost only Achnanthes minutissima in Kakehashi river and Godani river, which were polluted with waste water from Ogoya copper mine. The relationship between the concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd) in river water and the attached substances (algae and silt etc.) and the relative abundances of diatom taxa were investigated in detail. The results indicated that the higher is the concentration of heavy metals in the river environment, the higher is only the relative abundances of Achnanthes minutissima. Thus, the taxon can be used as a bioindicator of heavy metal pollution. The relative rates of toxic chemical forms of copper in algae were 61 - 92% in the attached substances and 49 - 70% in the sediment on the river bed, respectively. Therefore, it was found that diatom as Achnanthes minutissima had a tolerance to heavy metals in river water, being able to live in such an environment. Since the water treated with calcium hydroxide from the deposition reservoir of Ogoya mine enters in Godani river, the river is polluted by heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd etc.). From the viewpoint of both biological and chemical analyses, Godani river is still polluted with heavy metals, because their concentrations in the river samples were very high. On the other hand, in Kakehashi river, the concentrations of heavy metals were very low and the distributions of some diatoms appeared in an unpolluted Nishimata river were observed. Therefore, Kakehashi river seems to be considerably recovered from heavy-metal pollution after closing the Ogoya mine.

AB  - Ecological fiscal transfers (EFTs) involve higher levels of government distributing funds to lower levels of government based on ecological indicators. In 2015 India established the world's largest system of EFTs when its 14th Finance Commission added forest cover to the formula that determines the amount of tax revenue the Union government distributes annually to each state. Here we gather state-by-state data on forestry budgets to assess whether India's EFTs incentivized states to protect and restore forests as evidenced by increases to their forestry budgets. We find that states increased their forestry budgets by 19% in absolute terms in the three years after the introduction of EFTs relative to the three years prior. However, forestry budgets as a share of overall state budgets shrank by 16% after the introduction of EFTs, from 0.99% to 0.83%. Furthermore, states that obtained a larger share of their budget from EFTs did not disproportionately increase their forestry budget. Taken together, this suggests the introduction of EFTs has not yet led states to increase their forestry budgets. We develop a causal chain that suggests two reasons this could be: (1) low expectations on the part of state government officials that EFTs would continue in such a way that increases in forest cover would be rewarded with increases in revenue; and/or (2) insufficient motivation to increase forestry budgets as an investment in future revenue from EFTs. The 15th Finance Commission has plausibly addressed low expectations by keeping forests in the tax revenue distribution formula for another period and updating the year for which forest cover is measured from 2013 to 2017. It has plausibly addressed insufficient motivation by increasing the weight on forests in the formula from 7.5% to 10%. Future research can show whether these modified EFTs incentivize states to increase forest protection and restoration.

AB  - The paper compares legal foundations as well as practices of intergovernmental fiscal relations between central and regional authorities in the Russian Federation and in the People's Republic of China. The relevance of such cross-country comparative analysis follows from the huge importance of intergovernmental fiscal relations now in both countries. Equally faced with the challenges of mitigating regional disparities, of developing lagging regions without prejudice to regions driving economic growth, of creating incentives for regional authorities to develop their own revenue sources, Russia and China currently adhere to rather different approaches to solving these problems. Meanwhile, in terms of many indicators of socio-economic development, such as per capita parameters of budgets, Russian and Chinese regions are quite similar. With this in mind, some elements of the Chinese practice of intergovernmental fiscal relations and of the organization of the budget system in general can be of interest for the Russian Federation. They can be viewed as examples of good practice, the effectiveness of which is confirmed by higher rates of socio-economic development, which People's Republic of China demonstrates for many years. Notwithstanding certain constitutional restrictions related to the federal nature of the Russian state, it can be argued that some elements of the Chinese model can at least be seen as possible strategic alternatives when choosing ways of improving or reforming Russian budget system. The centralization of revenues along with the radical decentralization of expenditures is probably the most interesting specific feature of the Chinese budgetary system; it appears to be a possible solution to ensure the commitment of subnational governments to regional development while maintaining the instruments of control over them by central authorities.

AB  - The United Nations Environment Program, World Ocean Assessment, requires rapid assessment of the state of marine ecosystems at regional scales, yet a practical method for achieving this in data-poor regions has not been developed. We present a method that is capable of synthesising information across a broad range of ecosystem components in a timely manner, while also overcoming the paucity of empirical data available at large spatial scales. We develop a hierarchical and adaptable assessment framework that encompasses 'Biodiversity', 'Ecosystem health' and 'Environmental pressure' components, which are further divided into parameters (representing the structure and/or function of each component) and indicators (which indicate the spatial distribution of the assessed parameter). We argue that this framework is best utilised within an expert elicitation process. To determine the validity of this framework in undertaking a WOA, this approach was applied to the South China Sea Large Marine Ecosystem during a 3-day pilot workshop held in Bangkok. Thailand, 2012. Forty-five experts from 11 countries in the region participated in assessing the biodiversity, ecosystem health and environmental pressures structuring 104 pre-identified ecosystem variables. The majority of areas within the SCS were graded as 'Poor' in terms of their biodiversity, with biodiversity in decline within 64% of these variables. In contrast, most areas were graded as 'Good' for ecosystem health, with 51% of variables considered stable in terms of ecosystem health. However, most areas were graded as 'Poor' for ecosystem pressures, with pressures either stable or increasing. Ecosystem variables in 'Poor' or 'Very Poor' condition in Most (80%) of areas were identified as conservation priorities. These variables were primarily associated with groups of taxa, including elasmobranch fauna, inner-shelf demersal fishes, squid and large invertebrate species inhabiting reefs (e.g., giant clam). A range of iconic species (e.g., dugong), key habitats (e.g., coral reefs), and key ecosystem processes (e.g., benthic productivity) were also graded as 'Poor' in Most (80%) of areas. Confidence in condition and trend scores was assessed to be medium or high for 86% of variables assessed. The rapid method developed here assessed and conveyed to policy-makers a broad-scale overview of the condition, trends and issues in the SCS. The method provides a way forward for future World Ocean Assessments of large data-poor marine ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rural ecosystem health is an effective metrics of the stable state of rural components and subsystems referring to the ability to meet the reasonable needs of human society, self-maintain and update the ecosystem. With the development of regional ecosystem assessment, the theoretical breakthrough demand to integrate ecosystem composition integrity and ecosystem services (ES) supply-demand from the perspective of coupled human and ecosystem into ecosystem health assessment is increasing, stakeholders are interested in improving some comprehensive evaluation framework to reverse inadequate understanding of focusing on the single measurement of rural natural ecosystem status and external disturbance. This study established an improved rural ecosystem health assessment framework (REH-SD) with integrating ecological integrity and ES supply-demand from the perspective of social-economy-natural complex ecosystem, which put forward a set of assessment index system combining with SDGs17 indicators, and took Chongqing as a case study to reveal quantitatively spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristics of rural ecosystem health. The results shown that: 1) The comprehensive score of rural ecosystem health in Chongqing from 2008 to 2018 was formed into an obvious variation evolutionary rule of gentle wave first and then rising rapidly ranging from 0.618 to 0.885, which was consistent with the trend of the physical state of rural ecosystem health (PREH); 2) The rural ecosystem health of 36 districts and counties in Chongqing increased gradually from the west Chongqing and metropolitan areas to the northeast and southeast Chongqing on the whole, showing a spatial heterogeneity of central and western collapse, northeast wings high, local protrusion, and the unhealth type (33.33%) and subhealth type (27.78%) dominated throughout the study area in 2018; 3) The improved REH-SD framework could appropriately modify the traditional evaluation results according to supply and demand relationship, the serious ecological deficit in metropolitan areas aggravated dramatically the deterioration of rural ecosystem, inversely, the REH-SD was significantly affected by the PREH in northeast and southeast Chongqing. The improved REH-SD framework was verified to be advanced comparing with the traditional evaluation method, and our results could provide significant differentiated recommendations for mountain ecological environment protection and restoration project.

LA  - English
KW  - ESTUARY
AB  - Many aquatic ecosystems in the United States and worldwide are impaired by the over-enrichment of waters by nutrients. In advanced stages, the process of eutrophication can cause harmful algae blooms. This research retrieved the concentrations of suspended chlorophyll (Chl), suspended minerals (SM), colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and turbidity (total attenuation) from AVIRIS imagery of a severely over-enriched waterway in North Carolina, and evaluated if these parameters could be used as indicators Of conditions leading to algae blooms. A digital image processing algorithm called QSC1 (Quantitative Shoreline Characterization, Version 1.0) was used. The retrieved water quality parameter values were tested by statistical comparisons to field measurements made at the time of the AVIRIS data collection. Applying QSC1 to AVIRIS imagery resulted in measurements of Chl that correlated well with field measurements (r = 0.84). Problems with field sampling prevented the assessment of retrieved SM and DOC. The statistical correlation analysis indicated that, for comparison to remotely sensed data, field measurements in the steadily flowing Neuse River must be collected within two hours of the imagery. Thematic maps of each water quality parameter were generated from the imagery and evaluated. The maps of Chl showed spatial patterns consistent with the field data and circulation of the river, and indicated potential point and non-point sources. Statistical and principle component analyses were used to assess whether the AVIRIS water quality measurements were directly or indirectly related to parameters and conditions indicative of nutrient loading and algae blooms that were measured in the field. The AVIRIS measurements were used to create a new index of eutrophication, the Algae Production Potential Index (APPI), for the purpose of mapping where conditions of high nutrient loading and potential algae blooms exist. The index uses direct measurements of Chl, DOC, and SM (as a surrogate for phosphate). These measurements are combined in a GIS model based on ecological relationships. Although not field verified, the APPI map shows patterns of algae bloom conditions that are similar in size, scale, and location to previous blooms in the Neuse.

AB  - 1. Ecoacoustic methods are increasingly used to monitor the state of populations and ecosystems. In freshwater environments, they present the clear advantages of being non-invasive, reducing bias, and providing continuous observations instead of only limited sampling snapshots in time. However, similar to standard bio-assessment methods, temporal variation and choice of indicators can greatly influence ecoacoustic assessments, highlighting the importance of sampling and analysis design.
   2. In this study, we quantified diurnal variation in underwater sound and its effect on sampling regimes for two waterholes in the Einasleigh River, Northern Australia. Recording continuously for 6 days, and subsampling 5 s every 10 min, we found 22 distinct sounds that were emitted by fish, Hemiptera and Coleoptera as well as another 22 of abiotic or unknown origin.
   3. Through rarefaction analyses, we found that subsampling the data to 60% of the recorded sound events resulted in capture of most of the 44 identified sound types. Temporal heterogeneity-patchy sound events through time-needs to be considered when maximising detected sound events. Reducing the sampling interval from every 10 min to half-hourly or hourly had a much greater effect on capturing all sound types compared to the number of days recorded or the length of the recording. Overall, only 10-20% of the sound events need to be annotated for most sound types to be described; for example, restricting analysis of the days recorded to only three and the recording interval to 0.5-1 s. Acoustic indices were dominated by three main event types-a diurnally flowing creek, a nocturnal chorus of Hemiptera, as well as a dawn chorus of terapontid fishes.
   4. We conclude with two key messages: First, a select group of informative signals can be monitored using very simple methods-namely, converting an audio stream into indices using freely available software. Second, however, to detect less acoustically dominant sound events, manual annotation or single call processing will still be needed. While these findings are encouraging, similar analysis will need to be conducted within other freshwater ecosystems before general conclusions about optimal sampling regimes can be drawn.

AB  - Trophic dynamics (community composition and feeding relationships) have been identified as important drivers of methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulation in lakes, reservoirs, and marine ecosystems. The relative importance of trophic dynamics and geochemical controls on MeHg bioaccumulation in streams, however, remains poorly characterized. MeHg bioaccumulation was evaluated in eight stream ecosystems across the United States (Oregon, Wisconsin, and Florida) spanning large ranges in climate, landscape characteristics, atmospheric Hg deposition, and stream chemistry. Across all geographic regions and all streams, concentrations of total Hg (THg) in top predator fish and forage fish, and MeHg in invertebrates, were strongly positively correlated to concentrations of filtered THg (FTHg), filtered MeHg (FMeHg), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC); to DOC complexity (as measured by specific ultraviolet absorbance); and to percent wetland in the stream basins. Correlations were strongest for nonurban streams. Although regressions of log[Hg] versus delta N-15 indicate that Hg in biota increased significantly with increasing trophic position within seven of eight individual streams, Hg concentrations in top predator fish (including cutthroat, rainbow, and brown trout; green sunfish; and largemouth bass) were not strongly influenced by differences in relative trophic position. Slopes of log[Hg] versus delta N-15, an indicator of the efficiency of trophic enrichment, ranged from 0.14 to 0.27 for all streams. These data suggest that, across the large ranges in FTHg (0.14-14.2 ng L-1), FMeHg (0.023-1.03 ng L-1), and DOC (0.50-61.0 mg L-1) found in this study, Hg contamination in top predator fish in streams likely is dominated by the amount of MeHg available for uptake at the base of the food web rather than by differences in the trophic position of top predator fish.

AB  - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Conservation Program supports the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) in the United States Pacific, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. NCRMP conducts standardized observations of biological, climatic, and socioeconomic indicators across American Samoa, Guam, the Main Hawaiian Islands, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Pacific Remote Islands, Florida, the Flower Garden Banks, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. NCRMP provides periodic, national-level assessments of the status of United States coral reef ecosystems and communities connected to them. In 2014, NCRMP partnered with the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science on an unprecedented collaboration between federal and jurisdictional/state agencies, academia, and non-governmental organizations to synthesize NCRMP data into a reporting format designed to be accessible and relevant to the public and policy makers. The process involved multi-year data analyses of key benthic, fish, and climate indicators. In populated jurisdictions, socioeconomic data were integrated to assess public support for management actions, participation in pro-environmental behaviors, and awareness of threats to coral reefs. Jurisdictions were scored using a report-card scale (0-100%) by establishing references for each indicator using best-available historical data or expert opinion where historical data did not exist or were not statistically comparable. Despite overall ecosystem scores of Fair for all combined Atlantic (70%) and Pacific (74%) jurisdictions, the current trend is downward with a majority of United States coral reefs declining and vulnerable to further degradation. Remote, uninhabited reefs had an advantage with respect to reef fish population scores, i.e., Flower Garden Banks (85%) and Pacific Remote Islands (93%), when compared to populated location scores, i.e., Puerto Rico (63%) and Main Hawaiian Islands (66%). All coral reefs are highly impacted by climate change, and climate impacts were more pronounced than expected on remote reefs, i.e., the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (58%). Presenting results in a report-card style facilitates communication to the public and policy makers, and provides a useful mechanism to garner support for management actions such as expanding protected areas; enforcing existing regulations; increasing climate change education; reducing land-based sources of pollution; and other actions to improve the trajectory of coral reef ecosystem conditions.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. The paper is devoted to a topical environmental theme - a study of the destabilization of drinking groundwater quality in the conditions of modem intensive technogenesis of geological environment.
   The purpose of the article is 2 components of a study of the groundwater quality deterioration of buchak-kaniv aquifer: - an identification of the ecological and hydrogeological factors of influence on the water qualitative composition; - an ensuring of the environmentally safe use of groundwater.
   Materials and methods. The research is based on an analysis of the results of over 700 groundwater chemical analyses of the target aquifer within the region. The chemical researches have been carried out during the period of active man-made pressure on the geological environment of studied territory (1960-2015). The available current data of geological, ecological and neotectonic conditions of studied area have been also used.
   The following methods of obtaining, processing and interpretation of necessary ecological-hydrogeological data have been used in the paper: field, chemical-analytical, comparative and graphical methods. A number of the common research methods have been used for the information processing - an analysis, a synthesis, a systematization, a classification, a modeling. The mathematical and statistical methods have been also used in the processing of received large data set. The interpolation and analogy methods have been used to simulate changes in the groundwater hydrochemical features using Mapinfo Professional 10.0.
   Results and scientific novelty. For the first time on the basis of analysis of geological, ecological-hydrogeological and neotectonic conditions of region, the factors of influence on the qualitative composition of groundwater at the buchak-kaniv water intakes were revealed.
   On the basis of these factors - the priority indicators of buchak-kaniv aquifer water quality for its systematic hydrogeochemical monitoring under the infiltration of pollutants from the surface and their inflow from below in the zones of influence of tectonic structures have been proposed.
   For the first time a direct positive correlation between a change of the content of characteristic indicator elements of influence on the ecological-hydrogeological state of groundwater (mineralization, Cl-, F-, Fe-total, Br-, B3+, J(-)) and the value of total water withdrawal in the zone of direct influence of tectonic faults of East-Poltava tectonic structure has been found.
   An approach for the ecologically safe use of target aquifer waters within the buchak-kaniv water intakes of Eastern Ukraine, which is based on the established correlation between the factors of influence and the qualitative composition of waters, has been developed.
   Practical significance. Due to an approbation of the proposed water quality control system at the Poltava water intakes network, which is strategically important within the region of research, an optimization of the total water withdrawal at the water intakes has been justified (the recommended limit is 50-60 thousand m(3)/day).
   The perspective areas for location of new water intakes within a 40 km radius around Poltava city have been identified (a total area - 750 km(2)). The estimated resources of drinking groundwater (54.5 thousand m(3)/day) have been calculated. Due to the using of these resources it is possible to gradually replace the current water supply of urban agglomeration with high-quality groundwater.

AB  - Background A vast number of chemical substances are released into the aquatic environment, leading to complex chemical mixtures in surface waters. Current water quality assessments, however, are based on the risk assessment of single substances. To consider potential mixture effects in water quality assessments, the North Rhine Westphalian State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection (LANUV), Germany started a project assessing mixture toxicity in surface waters. This article summarises the mixture evaluation of chemical data collected by the Erftverband during a water sampling campaign in the Erft River in 2016/2017. Altogether, 153 substances were included in the analysis, of which 98 were detected. Two different approaches based on the concept of concentration addition were used to analyse the data. The results were compared to findings based on datasets from LANUV surveillance monitoring according to the EU Water Framework Directive. Results Acute and chronic mixture risk calculations indicated risks for 32% and up to 90% of the samples, respectively. The greatest acute toxic pressure was identified for the aquatic flora due to continuous exposure to varying pesticides, whereas the greatest chronic mixture risk was identified for fish as result of a ubiquitous presence of the pharmaceuticals diclofenac and ibuprofen. Overall, only a limited number of substances significantly contributed to the calculated mixture risks. However, these substances varied seasonally and regionally. When mixture risks were calculated based on different datasets, the monitoring design markedly affected the outcome of the mixture risk assessment. Data gaps of both ecotoxicological and exposure data lead to high uncertainties in the mixture risk assessment. Conclusions Ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms caused by chemical mixtures can be expected along the Erft River throughout the year. Both mixture risk assessment approaches can be used for a conservative assessment of mixture risks and characterise the aquatic pollution in the river more realistically than single substance assessments. For the integration of mixture risk evaluations into the assessment and management of the chemical water quality, a two-staged assessment combining both approaches is suggested. To improve future risk assessments, the accessibility and exchange of high-quality ecotoxicological data should be enhanced.

AB  - The San Pedro River in the southwestern United States retains a natural flood regime and has several reaches with perennial stream flow and shallow ground water. However, much of the river flows intermittently. Urbanization-linked declines in regional ground-water levels have raised concerns over the future status of the riverine ecosystem in some parts of the river, while restoration-linked decreases in agricultural ground-water pumping are expected to increase stream flows in other parts. This study describes the response of the streamside herbaceous vegetation to changes in stream flow permanence. During the early summer dry season, streamside, herbaceous cover and species richness declined continuously across spatial gradients of flow permanence, and composition shifted from hydric to mesic species at sites with more intermittent flow. Hydrologic threshold values were evident for one plant functional group: Schoenoplectus acutus, Juncus torreyi, and other hydric riparian plants declined sharply in cover with loss of perennial stream flow. In contrast, cover of mesic riparian perennials (including Cynodon dactylon, an introduced species) increased at sites with intermittent flow. Patterns of hydric and mesic riparian annuals varied by season: in the early summer dry season their cover declined continuously as flow became more intermittent, while in the late summer wet season their cover increased as the flow became more intermittent. Periodic drought at the intermittent sites may increase opportunities for establishment of these annuals during the monsoonal flood season. During the late summer flood season. stream flow was present at most sites, and fewer vegetation traits were correlated with flow permanence; cover and richness were correlated with other environmental factors including site elevation and substrate nitrate level and particle size. Although perennial-flow and intermittent-flow sites support different streamside plant communities, all of the plant functional groups are abundant at perennial-flow sites when viewing the ecosystem at broader spatial and temporal scales: mesic riparian perennials are common in the floodplain zone adjacent to the river channel and late-summer hydric and mesic annuals are periodically abundant after large floods.

AB  - We presented the validation method of the quantitative determination of Nitrofuran (AOZ) and Chloramphenicol in honey samples by the RidaScreen (R) test system (according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and Guidelines for the validation of screening methods for residues of veterinary medicines (initial validation and transfer) of 20/01/2010). We revealed several validation indicators like cc ss (detection capability), accuracy (precision), recovery and some others during the initial validation (specificity and selectivity). We determined the minimum detection values of Nitrofuran (AOZ) in honey, the highest value (the highest response) for blank samples is 0.066 mu g/kg and the lowest value for enriched samples (lowest response) is 0.401 mu g/kg. Based on the obtained results none of the responses for enriched samples do not coincide with the range of replies of blank samples. Hence, it follows that the detection capability (CC ss) for this screening method is less than or equal to 0.4 mu g/kg. For the determination of Chloramphenicol, the highest response is noted for blank samples - 0.021 mu g/kg (21 ng/kg) and the lowest response noted for enriched samples is 0.048 mu g/kg (48 ng/kg). None of the responses for enriched samples do not coincide with the range of replies of blank matrix (samples), therefore we could conclude that the CC ss of this screening method is less than or equal to 0.05 mu g/kg (ss-error < 5 %) and the cut-off value of this test is 0.048. According to the validation the lowest value of substances that could detected by ELISA using the following test systems for competitive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) for Nitrofuran (AOZ) - 0.4 mu g/kg, for Chloramphenicol - 0.05 mu g/kg. Described in State Standard 4497: 2005 "Natural Honey. Technical conditions" the maximum allowable level for Chloramphenicol - 0.3 mu g/kg and Nitrofuran (AOZ) - 0.6 mu g/kg require correction according to the established validation parameters.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity has been put to the highest priority throughout the world. The process of identifying threatened ecosystems will search for different drivers related to biodiversity loss. The present study aimed to generate spatial information on deforestation and ecological degradation indicators of fragmentation and forest fires using systematic conceptual approach in Telangana state, India. Identification of ecosystems facing increasing vulnerability can help to safeguard the extinctions of species and useful for conservation planning. The technological advancement of satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information System has increased greatly in assessment and monitoring of ecosystem-level changes. The areas of threat were identified by creating grid cells (5 x 5 km) in Geographical Information System (GIS). Deforestation was assessed using multi-source data of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013. The forest cover of 40,746 km(2), 29,299 km(2), 18,652 km(2), 18,368 km(2), 18,006 km(2), 17,556 km(2) and 17,520 km(2) was estimated during 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013, respectively. Historical evaluation of deforestation revealed that major changes had occurred in forests of Telangana and identified 1095 extinct, 397 critically endangered, 523 endangered and 311 vulnerable ecosystem grid cells. The fragmentation analysis has identified 307 ecosystem grid cells under critically endangered status. Forest burnt area information was extracted using AWiFS data of 2005 to 2014. Spatial analysis indicates total fire-affected forest in Telangana as 58.9 % in a decadal period. Conservation status has been recorded depending upon values of threat for each grid, which forms the basis for conservation priority hotspots. Of existing forest, 2.1 % grids had severe ecosystem collapse and had been included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 27.2 % in conservation priority hotspot-II and 51.5 % in conservation priority hotspot-III. This analysis complements assessment of ecosystems undergoing multiple threats. An integrated approach involving the deforestation and degradation indicators is useful in formulating the strategies to take appropriate conservation measures.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly throughout the world. Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID- 19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID- 19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID- 19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.

AB  - Metal wastes can significantly disturb aquatic communities, particularly photosynthetic organisms, the main primary producers in freshwater running ecosystems. In this study, biofilms and diatoms were used as bioindicators to characterize the kinetics of biofilm recovery. An experimental decontamination study was conducted under laboratory conditions, after biofilm colonisation at a site subject to discharge of industrial metals (Zn and Cd) and in parallel at an upstream site, metal-free, considered as a control. After 24 days of colonisation, biofilms were translocated and maintained in the laboratory for 56 days under clean conditions (control and decontamination) or metal contamination. Various tests were conducted from the community level-measures of metal bioaccumulation, cell densities and taxonomic investigations, to the individual level-measures of teratological forms. After 56 days of decontamination, Zn and Cd concentrations in decontaminated biofilms showed a sharp decline, respectively ranging from 6.7 +/- A 2 to 4 +/- A 2.5 mg Zn g(-1) DW and from 207.6 +/- A 24.5 to 45.4 +/- A 9.9 mu g Cd g(-1) DW. However, at the end of the experiment bioaccumulations remained significantly higher than concentrations in control biofilms. Despite a diatom evolution in biofilm assemblages, taxonomic inventories did not demonstrate a complete restoration of diatom communities in biofilms under decontamination conditions compared with controls, since metal-resistant species initially present after colonisation at the contaminated site, such as Eolimna minima, persisted in high abundance in decontaminated biofilms. Biofilms kept under metal pressure showed very high bioaccumulation capacities and a sharp decline of species diversity which allowed identification of some resistant species. Regarding these first results on the behaviour of diatom biofilms under experimental decontamination conditions, improvement of the natural hydrosystem's chemical state appears quickly, but an eventual return to good ecological status appears delayed, with the persistence of metal-tolerant species even after 56 days.

AB  - Two structurally homologous Mn compounds in different oxidation states were studied to investigate the relative influence of oxidation state and ligand environment on Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and Mn K beta X-ray emission spectroscopy (K beta XES). The two manganese compounds are the di-mu -oxo compound [L ' 2Mn(III)O(2)Mn(IV)L ' (2)](ClO4)(3), where L ' is 1,10-phenanthroline (Cooper, S. R.; Calvin, M. J. AI?I. Chem. Sec. 1977, 99, 6623- 6630) and the linear mono-mu -oxo compound [(LMnOMnL)-O-III-L-III] (ClO4)(2), where L- is the monoanionic N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-N ' -salicylidene 1,2-diaminoethane ligand (Horner, O.; Anxolabehere-Mallart, E.; Chariot, M. F.; Tchertanov, L.; Guilhem, J.; Mattioli, T. A.; Boussac, A.; Girerd, J.-J. Inorg. Chem. 1999, 38, 1222-1232). Preparative bulk electrolysis in acetonitrile was used to obtain higher oxidation states of the compounds: the (MnMnIV)-Mn-IV species for the di-mu -oxo compound and the (MnMnIV)-Mn-III and (MnMnIV)-Mn-IV species for the mono-mu -oxo compound. IR, UV/vis, EPR, and EXAFS spectra were used to determine the purity and integrity of the various sample solutions. The Mn K-edge XANES spectra shift to higher energy upon oxidation when the ligand environment remains similar. However, shifts in energy are also observed when only the ligand environment is altered. This is achieved by comparing the di-mu -oxo and linear mono-mu -oxo Mn-Mn moieties in equivalent oxidation states, which represent major structural changes. The magnitude of an energy shift due to major changes in ligand environment can be as large as that of an oxidation-state change. Therefore, care must be exercised when correlating the Mn K-edge energies to manganese oxidation states without taking into account the nature of the ligand environment and the overall structure of the compound. In contrast to Mn K-edge XANES, KP XES spectra show less dependence on ligand environment. The K beta (1,3) peak energies are comparable for the di-mu -oxo and mono-mu -oxo compounds in equivalent oxidation states. The energy shifts observed due to oxidation are also similar for the two different compounds. The study of the different behavior of the XANES pre-edge and main-edge features in conjunction with KP XES provides significant information about the oxidation state and character of the ligand environment of manganese atoms.

AB  - Although hazardous fuels reduction projects are being implemented widely in dry forests of the western United States, information concerning ecological responses of pinyon-juniper woodlands to fuels treatments is minimal. In this study we used a randomized block experimental design to investigate effects of fuels treatments on understory responses at a pinyon-juniper woodland site in northern Arizona. Treatment alternatives replicated (n = 12) on 1-ha units across the 760-ha site were thinning from below (Thin), prescribed burning, (Burn), thinning followed by prescribed burning (Thin + Burn), and untreated controls (Control). We measured cover of vascular plant species, biological soil crust, and forest floor substrate prior to treatment and one year, 2 years, and five years post-treatment. After five years, Thin and Thin + Burn plots showed statistically similar total plant cover but both showed significantly greater cover than Burn and Control plots. Cover increases on Thin + Burn plots were driven mainly by annual forb and nonnative species groups. Graminoid species with the C-4 photosynthetic pathway showed significantly greater cover in all treatment groups compared with Control plots. Burning alone tended to reduce shrub cover whereas thinning alone tended to increase shrub cover. We found no significant effects of treatment on cover of biological soil crust or bare soil. Regression analysis showed significant negative relationships between total understory plant cover and overstory canopy cover on burned and unburned plots. We found no significant effect of treatment on species richness over the measurement period. We observed 124 taxa in total, and mean richness ranged from 31.8 to 36.8 species per 500 m(2) in 2011. Similar to results for plant cover, we found significantly greater numbers of annual forb species in Thin + Burn compared with Control plots and significantly greater numbers of nonnative species in Thin + Burn compared with all other treatment groups. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed no significant differences in overall plant community composition among treatments. These results indicate that fuel reduction treatments on woodland sites may not dramatically affect understory abundance or composition within five years. Although treatments did not significantly differ in cover of biological soil crust or bare soil - indicators of ecosystem function - our results showed that thinning treatments followed by prescribed fire led to increases in cover of nonnative plant species.

AB  - The main objective of the research paper is to determine environmental sustainability and anthropogenic load in the territories of the united territorial community. Methodological basis of the research are general theoretical methods of scientific cognition, in particular dialectic method, system analysis, fundamental provisions of general economic theory. Methods of comparative and structural analysis, statistic groups were also used to analyze the level of ecologically sustainable development of regions; tabular method - for a visual representation of the dynamics of indicators. The methodology is aprobated on the territory of the Chernivtsi region. It is substantiated that the basis of sustainable development is the combination of economic, social and environmental sustainability. It has been established that the environmental factor is of the greatest concern at the moment. The reform of decentralization, which has been initiated, is partly directed at addressing environmental issues; at the same time, this process is long-term and requires significant resources. Determination of environmental sustainability and anthropogenic load on the territory of united territorial communities is important for ensuring sustainable development of rural territories. The research paper contains the calculations of the summarized values of regional environmental indicators of sustainable development and evaluates the natural and anthropogenic unsustainability of the environment. Ecologically safe, balanced and systematic development of territories is an integral part of spatial development of the region. It is the basis for solving the problem of harmonizing the goals of socio-economic development of certain territories with the principles of ecological safety of the country as a whole. Ensuring environmental sustainability and reducing anthropogenic load on the territory of the united territorial community may be due to the development of alternative energy and bioenergy. In the context of the study of this article, the development of environmental safety in a separate region is proposed as a systemic category that combines social, economic and environmental components, whose interaction involves the transition to environmentally sustainable production and consumer structures, increasing the efficiency of nature management, development of ecological infrastructure. The ecological dimension of sustainable development of rural areas is proposed to be determined using the following indicators: air quality, biodiversity, land resources, green zones, provision of the population with water, renewable energy sources, energy resources, atmospheric emissions, load on land resources, load on water resources, state of the system of drainage, radiation and ecological danger, generation of waste, waste management, participation of business entities in the formation of revenues from ecological dues, public participation in environmental protection, greenhouse gas emissions, satisfaction of the population with the state of the environment.

AB  - Environmental flows-the quantity of water required to maintain a river ecosystem in its desired state-are of particular importance in areas of high natural value. Water-dependent ecosystems are exposed to the risk of climate change through altered precipitation and evaporation. Rivers in the Narew basin in northeastern Poland are known for their valuable river and wetland ecosystems, many of them in pristine or near-pristine condition. The objective of this study was to assess changes in the environmental flow regime of the Narew river system, caused by climate change, as simulated by hydrological models with different degrees of physical characterization and spatial aggregation. Two models were assessed: the river basin scale model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the continental model of water availability and use WaterGAP. Future climate change scenarios were provided by two general circulation models coupled with the A2 emission scenario: IPSL-CM4 and MIROC3.2. To assess the impact of climate change on environmental flows, a method based conceptually on the "range of variability" approach was used. The results indicate that the environmental flow regime in the Narew basin is subject to climate change risk, whose magnitude and spatial variability varies with climate model and hydrological modeling scale. Most of the analyzed sites experienced moderate impacts for the Generic Environmental Flow Indicator (GEFI), the Floodplain Inundation Indicator, and the River Habitat Availability Indicator. The consistency between SWAT and WaterGAP for GEFI was medium: in 55 to 66% of analyzed sites, the models suggested the same level of impact. Hence, we suggest that state-of-the-art, high-resolution, global- or continental-scale models, such as WaterGAP, could be useful tools for water management decision-makers and wetland conservation practitioners, whereas models such as SWAT should serve as a complementary tool for more specific, smaller-scale, local assessments.

AB  - The value of biodiversity lies in its option value for the future, the greater the complement of contemporary biodiversity conserved today, the greater the possibilities for future biodiversity because of the diverse genetic resource needed to ensure continued evolution in a changing and uncertain world. From this perspective, biodiversity option value can be equated with richness in the different features expressed by species. An individual species of greater value is one contributing more novel features to a given subset. The feature diversity of species and communities is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the phylogenetic relationships among the species. The 'Phylogenetic Diversity' measure (PD) (Faith, 1992a) estimates the relative feature diversity of any nominated set of species by the sum of the lengths of all those branches spanned by the set. These branch lengths reflect patristic or path-length distances. This study first reviews and expands on some of the properties of PD, and develops simple modifications of the measure (DeltanPD and epsilonnPD) to enable capture of both the phylogenetic relatedness of species and their abundances in each sample. Then the application of PD, DeltanPD and epsilonnPD to a wide range of conservation and resource management issues is demonstrated using avian case studies. Supertree construction procedures (matrix representation using parsimony analysis; average consensus) were used to combine the extensive DNA-DNA hybridization tree of Sibley & Ahlquist (1990) with numerous, recently published phylogenetic reconstructions to derive a phylogenetic tree for the global avian fauna. Using this supertree as a systematic framework, the utility of PD was demonstrated in four case studies: (i) state of the environment reporting, with changes in avian faunas resulting from extinctions quantified as indicators of the state of biodiversity at Global, New Zealand and Waikato region scales, and changes in available habitat quantified as indicators of pressures on biodiversity in the Waikato region; (ii) setting priorities for threatened species management, with PD as a measure of option value integrated with information on survivorship expectations to develop a ranking among threatened New Zealand forest bird species; (iii) monitoring biotic response to management, with data from 5-minute counts used to analyse changes in forest bird communities under three management regimes in New Zealand; and (iv) selection of indicator species, with PD used to objectively identify subsets of species in the Global, New Zealand and Waikato avian faunas that comprise a high proportion of the option value in those faunas.

AB  - Model intercomparison studies in the climate and Earth sciences communities have been crucial to building credibility and coherence for future projections. They have quantified variability among models, spurred model development, contrasted within- and among-model uncertainty, assessed model fits to historical data, and provided ensemble projections of future change under specified scenarios. Given the speed and magnitude of anthropogenic change in the marine environment and the consequent effects on food security, biodiversity, marine industries, and society, the time is ripe for similar comparisons among models of fisheries and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project protocol version 1.0 (Fish-MIP v1.0), part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), which is a cross-sectoral network of climate impact modellers. Given the complexity of the marine ecosystem, this class of models has substantial heterogeneity of purpose, scope, theoretical underpinning, processes considered, parameterizations, resolution (grain size), and spatial extent. This heterogeneity reflects the lack of a unified understanding of the marine ecosystem and implies that the assemblage of all models is more likely to include a greater number of relevant processes than any single model. The current Fish-MIP protocol is designed to allow these heterogeneous models to be forced with common Earth System Model (ESM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) outputs under prescribed scenarios for historic (from the 1950s) and future (to 2100) time periods; it will be adapted to CMIP phase 6 (CMIP6) in future iterations. It also describes a standardized set of outputs for each participating Fish-MIP model to produce. This enables the broad characterization of differences between and uncertainties within models and projections when assessing climate and fisheries impacts on marine ecosystems and the services they provide. The systematic generation, collation, and comparison of results from Fish-MIP will inform an understanding of the range of plausible changes in marine ecosystems and improve our capacity to define and convey the strengths and weaknesses of model-based advice on future states of marine ecosystems and fisheries. Ultimately, Fish-MIP represents a step towards bringing together the marine ecosystem modelling community to produce consistent ensemble medium- and long-term projections of marine ecosystems.

AB  - Sucralose (1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-b-D-fructo-furanosyl 4-chloro-4-deoxy-a-D-galactopyranoside), sold under the trade name Splenda (R), has been detected in municipal effluents and surface waters in the United States and Europe. The environmental presence of sucralose has led to interest in the possibility of toxic effects in non-target species. This review presents an environmental risk assessment of sucralose based on available data concerning its presence, fate and effects in the environment. Sucralose, which is made by selective chlorination of sucrose, is a highly stable compound, which undergoes negligible metabolism in mammals, including humans, and displays a low biodegradation potential in the environment. This intense sweetener is highly soluble in water, displays a low bioaccumulation potential and a low sorption potential to soil and organic matter, and thus is predominantly present in the water column. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for sucralose, based on measured data in surface waters, was determined to be 10 mu g/L Aquatic toxicity studies using standardized, validated protocols used in regulatory decision making indicate that sucralose does not alter survival, growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms (such as plants, algae, crustaceans and fish) at concentrations >9000 times higher than those detected in the environment. Some studies, using non-standardized protocols, have reported behavioral and other non-traditional responses in aquatic organisms, but the relevance of these findings for assessing adverse effects on individuals and populations will require further investigation. In terms of traditional risk assessment, the proposed predicted no effect concentration for aquatic organisms (PNEC) was determined to be 0.93 mg/L, based on the lowest no effect concentration (NOEC) from a validated chronic study with mysid shrimp and an application factor of 100. The resultant PEC/PNEC quotient was determined to be well below 1 (PEC/PNEC = 0.08), thus indicating a limited risk to the environment using traditional ecological risk assessment approaches.

AB  - Road transport is one of the main pollutants of atmospheric air and soil in modern cities, therefore, an important issue is the comprehensive diagnosis of the state of the environment, which can be carried out by phytoindication methods, and which make it possible to comprehensively assess the environmental risks of the roadside environment for living organisms. The article analyzes the morphological and physiological changes of Taraxacum officinale Web. that occurred under the influence of vehicle emissions. For research, we chose a territory with significant aerotechnogenic loads due to both stationary sources of pollution and traffic flows - the southwestern district of the city for the analysis of plants, the following indicators were studied: mass of plants; leaf length; proportion of altered forms; ascorbic acid content; chlorophyll concentration. In the study, biometric, spectrophotometric and statistical methods were used. The results of the studies showed that in all plants inhibition of parameters was observed in comparison with the control samples. An analysis of the tightness of the relationship between the morphophysiological parameters of the plant, the traffic intensity and the distance from the road were influenced by the average mass of plants (r=0.97) in the area with heavy traffic, the content of chlorophyll (r=0.92) in the same area, the proportion of altered forms (r=-0.94). The correlation coefficient of the proportion of altered forms is negative, since the number of altered forms decreases with increasing distance from the road. It was found, that content of chlorophyll depends on traffic intensity and the distance from the road (the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.88-0.97). Indicators of leaf length and vitamin C content turned out to be less informative, since there is no clear relationship between these indicators and distance from the road (r=0.54), although with an increase in the distance from the highway, there is a slight increase in leaf length, but the content of vitamin C did not show depending on the distance to the road. The further developments lies in the refinement of the information content of such an indicator as the content of ascorbic acid in order to use it to indicate invisible changes in the vegetation cover.

AB  - Census-based approaches can provide important measures of the ecological processes controlling reef carbonate production states. Here, we describe a rapid, non-destructive approach to carbonate budget assessments, termed ReefBudget that is census-based and which focuses on quantifying the relative contributions made by different biological carbonate producer/eroder groups to net reef framework carbonate production. The methodology is presently designed only for Caribbean sites, but has potential to be adapted for use in other regions. Rates are calculated using data on organism cover and abundance, combined with annual extension or production rate measures. Set against this are estimates of the rates at which bioeroding species of fish, urchins and internal substrate borers erode reef framework. Resultant data provide a measure of net rates of biologically driven carbonate production (kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1)). These data have potential to be integrated into ecological assessments of reef state, to aid monitoring of temporal (same-site) changes in rates of biological carbonate production and to provide insights into the key ecological drivers of reef growth or erosion as a function of environmental change. Individual aspects of the budget methodology can also be used alongside other census approaches if deemed appropriate for specific study aims. Furthermore, the methodology spreadsheets are user-changeable, allowing local or new process/rate data to be integrated into calculations. Application of the methodology is considered at sites around Bonaire. Highest net rates of carbonate production, +9.52 to +2.30 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1), were calculated at leeward sites, whilst lower rates, +0.98 to -0.98 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1), were calculated at windward sites. Data are within the ranges calculated in previous budget studies and provide confidence in the production estimates the methodology generates.

AB  - The gudgeon (Gobio gobio (Linnaeus, 1758)) is a very interesting object for genetic, ichtyopathological and parasitological studies. This typical bottom species is sensitive to water pollution. Analysis of hematological parameters of the gudgeon can be used as an objective indicator of the ecological state and the degree of anthropogenic impact on the ecosystem of the reservoir. G. gobio is characterized by a wide range of nutrition and is itself included in the diet of predatory fish and fish-eating birds, thus playing a significant role in circulation of various parasites. In fish-breeding ponds, the gudgeon is often the object of unwanted fish because it can be a source of diseases of valuable fish species.
   The aim of this research was to study hematological parameters and parasite fauna of the gudgeon in a fish-breeding pond, in which it is a "weed" species. The ichthyological material was caught in July 2018 in Granny pond (53 degrees 81'24 '' N, 49 degrees 93'74 '' E). Table 1 shows hydrochemical parameters of the pond, allowing it to be attributed to relatively clean water bodies. The research complies with the ethical principles of the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental or other scientific purposes (Strasbourg, 18 March 1986). The fish were kept in separate rooms in aerated aquariums with optimal planting density, which minimized stress and anxiety levels. Animals received sufficient food. The study used a minimum number of fish, which were killed in a humane way. We conducted hematological studies of 21 individuals of G. gobio. Blood smears were fixed with ethanol and stained according to Romanovsky-Giemsa. We identified blood cells by Groff, Zinkl (1999). With each drug, differential count of white blood cells among 1000 erythrocytes in 5-10 fields of view was conducted. In order to assess the physiological state of fish and their immune status, we analyzed the ratio of blood elements, studied the leukocyte formula, determined the level of erythropoiesis, and recorded possible pathologies of erythrocytes. Research of macroparasites in 26 individuals of the gudgeon was carried out according to Bykhovskaya-Pavlovskaya (1985). For quantitative characteristics of infection of the animals, we used the following indicators: prevalence, intensity of infection and mean abundance.
   The leukocyte composition of the blood of the gudgeon was characterized by a wide variety (See Tables 2 and 3). The most numerous group of cells were lymphocytes. The average percentage of individual groups of leukocytes was within the physiological norm. The exception was eosinophils, the occurrence of which in the leukogram (up to 21.82% in ind.) indicated the development of eosinophilia. The proportion of immature red blood cells in most of the studied smears did not exceed 10% (See Table 4). 66.67% of gudgeon individuals had pathologically altered red blood cells in the bloodstream; 8 different types of disorders were observed (See Table 5). The most common pathology was poikilocytosis, registered in 61.90% of fish; 2.77% of the analyzed erythrocytes were characterized by the presence of this aberration. The frequency of occurrence of cells with other types of disorders among the total number of the studied ones did not exceed the value of their appearance in spontaneous mutagenesis (1%). The parasite fauna of fish in terms of fish ponds significantly depleted (See Table 6). 2 species of parasites (the cestode Neogryporhynchus cheilancristrotus, pl. (Wedl, 1855) and the nematode Contracaecum microcephalum, larva III (Rudolphi, 1819)) infect the host by alimentary means. These species were first observed in the parasite fauna of the gudgeon of the Volga river basin. All studied individuals of the gudgeon were infected with parasitic crustaceans Ergasilus sieboldi Nordmann, 1832, which is an extremely pathogenic parasite A high degree of fish invasion by crustaceans (up to 57 specimens per individual) can be a factor causing deviations in hematological parameters of the gudgeon.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze anthropogenic transformation of river-basin geosystems of the outer Subcarpathian region by geoinformational modeling tools using various methods of quantitative estimation of anthropogenic pressure; comparison of modeling results on the basis of administrative-territorial and natural units, selection of optimal structural units for the study of anthropogenic changes in basin geosystems.
   Research methods. The features of estimation methods of anthropogenic transformation level of territorial complexes, based on various conceptual approaches to the study of anthropogenic changes in the components of the environment were investigated. In particular, the article compares methods of F.M. Milkov, P.G. Shyshchenko, E. Klementova and V. Geinige, P.P. Borschevsky, M.V. Boyarin, I.P. Kovalchuk, N.M. Ridey and D.L. Shofolov, A.M. Tretyak and others and by the means of geoinformation modeling of riverbasin geosystems (namely, the case study of the outer Subcarpathian Dniester tributaries) shows the degree of representativeness of the results produced by each of them. It is noted that the technique by P.G. Shyshchenko allows to more accurately reflect the state of anthropogenic transformation of the river-basin system's natural conditions
   Results. A range of digital cartographic models was developed to evaluate and compare anthropogenic transformation level of the two Carpathian basin systems and to identify similar and distinctive features of the state and the transformation level of the basin systems' natural environment andstability of agricultural and forest landscapes in the studied basin geosystems. In particular, the study has revealed that the anthropogenic transformation of the outer Carpathian river basins is rising downstream. In the upper parts of the basins, it manifests itself in deforestation, while in the lower parts agricultural influence dominates. In addition, the index of anthropogenic transformation is rising with an increase in the order of sub-basins. The worst conditions of agro-landscapes are observed in the reclaimed valleys of the main rivers and their tributaries (due to the considerable level of plowing in the plain parts of the basins due to low fertility of soils, high levels of their acidity, degradation processes and chemical pollution). Stable territories are inherent exclusively in sub-basins which remain in their natural state or bear only traces of human activity. Settlements, which influence adjacent areas, are characterized by unsustainable land use. As for anthropogenic transformation, in the basin geosystem of the Berezhnytsia river its indicators increase upwards due to an increase in the share of arable land. On the contrary, in the basin of Bystrica much more land is occupied by industrial facilities, which affect the components of the geosystem the hardest. In this regard, the largest values of nature anthropogenic transformation indicators are found in the northern part of the basin and upstream of the city of Nadvirna and the town of Bykiv.
   Scientific significance. Case study of the administrative regions and the river basin located within them reveals the advantages of studying the geoenvironmental state of the territories according to their natural geographic taxonomic units, which allows to determine the most strained areas in geosystems. Particular attention is paid to the choice of optimum sized geospatial objects during the study of diverse basin systems. River sub-basins of the third order (according to the classification scheme of A. Strahler) were chosen to this purpose. Their size corresponds to that of the combined territorial communities' area. The importance of formation a database that reflects on the state of the geospatial entities under study is emphasized. For this purpose, it is appropriate to convey the structure of land use, represented by indices of different land cover and land use types (protected areas, forest covered areas, swamps and wetlands, meadows, gardens and vineyards), arable land, land under rural and urban development, natural objects modified by human activities (reservoirs , ponds, channels), land utilized by industry and transport in each investigated object. The article shows that the best solution to this problem is provided by the processing of high-resolution spatial (in panchromatic and multispectral) remote sensing data. The most appropriate in this case are QuickBird satellite imagery, designed to create and update topographic maps and plans, to make inventories of forests and agricultural lands and to assess their condition, therefore allowing mapping of land use types that are not identified in statistical inventories.
   Practical significance. The results of this work will be helpful in selecting the specific technique allowing the most complete representation of anthropogenic transformation of natural objects; in choosing the most optimal spatial units to carry out the analysis and, accordingly, to fill in the database. The developed models reveal the most anthropogenically loaded parts of river-basin geosystems of the outer Subcarpathian region, which is essential for the extrapolation of the obtained results to other right tributaries of the Dniester River.

AB  - At the end of the last century a number of environmental laws, technical regulations and normative documents were created. At the same time there appeared the combination of such concepts as "business", "environment-oriented activity", "sustainable development", "continuous development" and "sustainable product management" in scientific articles. Country's economic and social development should be oriented according to sustainable development principle in the way that current satisfaction of consumer needs would not reduce the possibilities of satisfying the needs of generations to come. Austria and Lithuania signed the declaration containing this point together with other countries in Rio De Janeiro in 1992. Every state must have an environmental policy, which links all development strategies of economy branches and territories.
   Eco-labelling of products and services is part of environment-oriented activity and sustainable product management. Eco-label is an important product quality indicator. Eco-certification and eco-labelling are considered as instrument within the European strategy of Integrated Product Policy to achieve more sustainable consumption patterns. It is possible that the increased demand for green products and services from informed consumers will induce enterprises to supply markets with more environmentally friendly products.
   The main purpose of this work is to analyze and generalize the practice of products and services eco-certification and eco-labelling in the world as well as to identify their better possibilities of usage in Lithuania and in Austria. The article uses the following methods: comparative and systematic analysis of scientific literature, survey of Austrian and Lithuanian enterprises and markets, mathematical statistics, interviewing experts, managers and consumers. Special parallel investigations have been performed to assess the status in Austria and Lithuania with the purpose to define consumer and manufacturer attitudes and preferences upon ecological products. The comparative study also includes the range of awarded products and services in both countries and the structure of enterprises taking part in national eco-labelling schemes. In a next step the information of consumers in both countries on labels and awarded products will be analysed. Factors of success and failures in the spreading of eco-labelling shall be worked out as a result of the comparative study.

AB  - Woody plants, as an important element of optimization of the urban environment, respond negatively to the ever-increasing technogenic pressure in cities. Therefore, it is necessary to assess their vital status, the most sensitive indicator of which being the content of plastid pigments. In this article we analyze the effects of multicomponent contamination on quantitative fluctuation of the level of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves of woody plants and identify sensitive species for the purpose of phytoindication in order to assess the state the environment is currently in. For the purposes of our research we chose the most widespread tree species in the city of Dnipro (Steppe zone of Ukraine), growing in the area of intensive industrial pollution and high levels of emissions by vehicles. We determined the content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls a and b, a + b, carotenoids) in the leaves of woody plants during different months of the growing season (June, July, August) and afterwards this data was used to compare the given parameters against the values taken from trees in the control area. The sum of chlorophyll levels a + b for the majority of plants was decreasing compared to the control. A more significant decrease in the content given by the sum of the a and b chlorophyll levels is observed in the assimilation organs of Aesculus hippocastanum L., Pinus pallasiana (D. Don) and Picea abies (L.) H. The most significant changes in the content of pigments in the leaves of plants under study were detected at the end of the growing season (in August). The content of green pigments in the leaves of Robinia pseudoacacia L., Platanus orientalis L. remains virtually unchanged. Under the influence of multicomponent contamination, the amount of pigments in the case of chlorophyll a in the majority of woody plant species decreases more rapidly compared to the control than in the case of chlorophyll b. The most noticeable drop in the content of chlorophyll a occurs in the leaves of Betula pendula Roth, Ae. hippocastanum, P. pallasiana, Acer platanoides L. and Tilia cordata Mill. The needles of P. abies and Picea pungens Engelm. 'Glauca' on the contrary suffer from a significant reduction in the concentration of chlorophyll b. The species most resistant to multicomponent contamination in terms of changes in the content of chlorophyll in the leaf blade are R. pseudoacacia, P. orientalis. The concentration of carotenoids in the leaves of plants such as B. pendula, Ae. hippocastanum, A. platanoides, T. cordata, P. abies is lower than that of species growing in the relatively clean zone. The concentration of pigments in Populus alba L., P. pungens 'Glauca' was higher during all of the months elapsed since the beginning of our study, whereas Ulmus laevis Pall., P. orientalis and R. pseudoacacia - had their concentrations reach an all time high in the second half of the growing season. Therefore, the peculiarities of quantitative fluctuation of photosynthetic pigments in plants, which are characterized by the variable resistance ability against the effects of technogenic multicomponent contamination, have been identified.

AB  - Amidst declarations of planetary emergency and reports that the window for limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees C is rapidly closing, global average temperatures and fossil fuel emissions continue to rise. Global fossil CO2 emissions have grown three years consecutively: +1.5% in 2017,+2.1% in 2018, and our slower central projection of +0.6% in 2019 (range of -0.32% to 1.5%) to 37 +/- 2 Gt CO2 (Friedlingstein et al 2019 Earth Syst. Sci. Data accepted), after a temporary growth hiatus from 2014 to 2016. Economic indicators and trends in global natural gas and oil use suggest a further rise in emissions in 2020 is likely. CO2 emissions are decreasing slowly in many industrialized regions, including the European Union (preliminary estimate of -1.7%[-3.4% to +0.1%] for 2019,-0.8%/yr for 2003-2018) and United States (-1.7%[-3.7% to+0.3%] in 2019,-0.8%/yr for 2003-2018), while emissions continue growing in India (+1.8%[+0.7% to 3.7%] in 2019,+5.1%/yr for 2003-2018), China(+2.6%[+0.7% to 4.4%] in 2019,+0.4%/yr for 2003-2018), and rest of the world((+0.5%[-0.8% to 1.8%] in 2019,+1.4%/yr for 2003-2018). Two under-appreciated trends suggest continued long-term growth in both oil and natural gas use is likely. Because per capita oil consumption in the US and Europe remains 5- to 20-fold higher than in China and India, increasing vehicle ownership and air travel in Asia are poised to increase global CO2 emissions from oil over the next decade or more. Liquified natural gas exports from Australia and the United States are surging, lowering natural gas prices in Asia and increasing global access to this fossil resource. To counterbalance increasing emissions, we need accelerated energy efficiency improvements and reduced consumption, rapid deployment of electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage technologies, and a decarbonized electricity grid, with new renewable capacities replacing fossil fuels, not supplementing them. Stronger global commitments and carbon pricing would help implement such policies at scale and in time.

AB  - 1. Ecosystem services (ES) from mountain forests are highly relevant for human societies. ES with a direct economic support function (e.g. timber production), regulatory services (e.g. protection from natural hazards) and cultural services (e.g. recreation) are likely to be affected strongly by a rapidly changing climate. To evaluate whether adverse climate change effects on ES can be counteracted by adapting management, dynamic models and indicator-based assessments are needed.
   2. We applied a forest dynamic model in case study areas of four European mountain regions and evaluated the future supply of four ES - timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and protection against natural hazards - using state-of-the-art ES indicators. Forest dynamics were simulated under three management scenarios (no management, business-as-usual and alternative management) and five climate change projections for selected representative stand types in each region. We analysed potential trade-offs and synergies between ES and evaluated future changes among regions, forest stands, climate and management scenarios.
   3. Impacts of climate change on the provision of multiple ES were found to be highly heterogeneous and to depend on the region, site and future climate. In the absence of large-scale natural disturbance (not considered), protection services, carbon stock and deadwood abundance (proxy for biodiversity) benefitted from no management in all regions. Negative impacts of climate change were evident for the provision of multiple ES but limited to the most severe climate scenarios and low-elevation stands. Synergies and trade-offs between the majority of ES were found to be sensitive to the choice of management strategy and - in some regions - to climate change.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Management regimes in European mountain forests should be regionally adapted to stand and site conditions. Although in some cases alternative management regimes may be more suitable than current management for supporting multiple ecosystem services, adaptation options should be evaluated carefully at the local scale due to the highly different magnitude of the impacts of climate change in different regions and along elevation gradients.

AB  - Purpose - The entrepreneurial capability (EC) environment refers to the general social and economic settings of a given local/regional entrepreneurship environment. The primary purpose of this study is to uncover key indicators of the EC milieu and test these components empirically within the context of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)-5 economies to elucidate the current state of their EC environments, at the regional and national levels. To this end, the aim of this study is twofold. First, this work endeavors to explicate the determinants of EC, with aims of elucidating its association to commercial opportunities in (ASEAN)-5 economies, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Next, this study applies the developed theory, including the identified determinants of EC to empirically test the efficiency and imperative coefficients of variables that have an impact on perceived entrepreneurial capabilities within a given environment.
   Design/methodology/approach -This research applies two frontier models, namely, the consistent estimation of fixed-effects and linear transformation stochastic frontier models, to assess the coefficients of significant EC variables for the panel sample. Data corresponding to the assessed variables were retrieved from the databases of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) -2016 and the World Competitiveness Yearbook (WCY) -2016, for the period, 2010-2016.
   Findings - The attained results suggest that factors corresponding to the variables "Entrepreneurship as a good career choice" and "perceived opportunities" have played a significantly positive role on the EC environment of ASEAN 05, although findings suggest both factors may still be improved upon. Conversely, the "fear of failure rate" factor was shown to have exerted a negative impact on the efficiency of the EC environment of ASEAN 05. Other important variables - such as intellectual property rights, university education and knowledge transfer rate - were shown to generate a positive impact on the EC environment of these economies.
   Originality/value - This study makes an important contribution to the entrepreneurship literature and can stimulate policymakers to rethink the EC settings of ASEAN-05 in their pursuit of an innovation-driven region.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uses environmental models to inform rulemaking and policy decisions at multiple spatial and temporal scales. As decision-making has moved towards integrated thinking and assessment (e.g. media, site, region, services), the increasing complexity and interdisciplinary nature of modern environmental problems has necessitated a new generation of integrated modeling technologies. Environmental modelers are now faced with the challenge of determining how data from manifold sources, types of process-based and empirical models, and hardware/software computing infrastructure can be reliably integrated and applied to protect human health and the environment.
   In this study, we demonstrate an Integrated Modeling Framework that allows us to predict the state of freshwater ecosystem services within and across the Albemarle-Pamlico Watershed, North Carolina and Virginia (USA). The Framework consists of three facilitating technologies: Data for Environmental Modeling automates the collection and standardization of input data; the Framework for Risk Assessment of Multimedia Environmental Systems manages the flow of information between linked models; and the Supercomputer for Model Uncertainty and Sensitivity Evaluation is a hardware and software parallel-computing interface with pre/post-processing analysis tools, including parameter estimation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. In this application, five environmental models are linked within the Framework to provide multimedia simulation capabilities: the Soil Water Assessment Tool predicts watershed runoff; the Watershed Mercury Model simulates mercury runoff and loading to streams; the Water quality Analysis and Simulation Program predicts water quality within the stream channel; the Habitat Suitability Index model predicts physicochemical habitat quality for individual fish species; and the Bioaccumulation and Aquatic System Simulator predicts fish growth and production, as well as exposure and bioaccumulation of toxic substances (e.g., mercury).
   Using this Framework, we present a baseline assessment of two freshwater ecosystem services-water quality and fisheries resources-in headwater streams throughout the Albemarle-Pamlico. A stratified random sample of 50 headwater streams is used to draw inferences about the target population of headwater streams across the region. Input data is developed for a twenty-year baseline simulation in each sampled stream using current land use and climate conditions. Monte Carlo sampling (n = 100 iterations per stream) is also used to demonstrate some of the Framework's experimental design and data analysis features. To evaluate model performance and accuracy, we compare initial (i.e., uncalibrated) model predictions (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, fish density, and methylmercury concentration within fish tissue) against empirical field data. Finally, we 'roll-up' the results from individual streams, to assess freshwater ecosystem services at the regional scale. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The approaches for creating a mathematical model for monitoring natural and technogenic systems (PTS) and emergency situations (ES) based on the probability of gradual failures are outlined.
   The monitoring of the NAS and ES provides for comprehensive monitoring of changes in the natural and anthropogenic environment and its components. The complexity of this process is determined mainly by the complexity of the diagnostics of the monitoring objects and the precise measurement of a large number of indicators that determine the conditions and factors of the state of the NAS, environmental pollution, etc.
   The practical solution of this problem is possible on the basis of the use of modern mathematical and geo-information methods of modeling that provide a comprehensive reflection of heterogeneous and multi-linked processes of formation and development of emergency situations of different origins, which can not be achieved with the use of traditional technologies.
   To describe the functioning of monitoring systems, it is worth building a mathematical model of the research object. The most complete state of the object of the study is characterized by its mathematical functional and statistical model. However, a more complete description of the static and dynamic state of the monitoring object is a probabilistic description of the state of objects with the help of distribution laws of the probabilities of the parameters of the input influences elements, output parameters and vector-operators. Since the probabilities of sudden bounces are determined by known formulas of the reliability theory, the main attention is drawn to the determination of the probability of the gradual failures occurrence.It is established that three mathematical models may be applied to determine the probability of gradual failures (a mathematical model based on the integration of differential equations; a mathematical model based on the Monte Carlo method; a mathematical model based on the quasilinear disturbances method). The results show, that the proposed method of research may use to simulate various scenarios of flooding in the territories of the Chernihiv region.

AB  - In the oil and gas industry, which is the basis of the Russian energy market, a significant and urgent question arises: How to distribute companies according to their investment attractiveness? Accordingly, quantitative indicators are needed. Lacking extensive experience in the practical implementation of fundamental rating tools, work is needed to develop methodologies of weighting coefficients and lists, built on the experience of the "big three" rating agencies. The article proposes an algorithm for forming an integral rating of companies based on financial reporting indicators and the author's rules of fuzzy logic based on the principle of "circular convolution", from the best to the slave, deepening the analysis to the center, when all companies are exhausted and places in the rating are distributed. The problem of assessing and integrally indexing the indicators of large companies in leading sectors of the economy (e.g., oil and gas, banks, electricity) is becoming manifest, while it is obvious that there is competition between large companies of the country's leading industries for state investment resources. The nature of the leading industries is such that it is necessary to assess the quality of the company's functioning based on the formation of rating groups. Based on the rating, investments are distributed among the companies under consideration. The author has developed a portfolio model that is analogous to the Harry Max Markowitz model, which does not contradict this model but allows consideration of a broader range of risk assessments used in the model (for example, the rating of companies). The optimal portfolio is built, taking into account the resulting index and the initial grouping in the hierarchical data correction mode. The logically sequential method of circular convolution of four important indicators to an integral index and a mathematically substantiated method for optimizing the minimax portfolio presented in the work will allow the investor to develop optimal (from the point of view of the transparency of the apparatus used, mathematical feasibility and time spent on the implementation of the software package) tools for investing and enlarging his capital.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive assessment and comparative analysis of the ecological balance of territories of the three key small; towns in Kyiv region: Boyarka, Vyshneve and Irpin, as well as tracking the dynamics of ecological stability of the towns' territories in the system of general planning. The following indicators of anthropogenic transformation and natural protection of urban areas were calculated according to known methods based on data available from the towns' new Master Plans: coefficients of anthropogenic impact, anthropogenic transformation, nature protection, and ecological stability, absolute and relative tension of the ecological and economic state. The rationality of general planning in terms of ecological balance of urban areas is estimated. The study established that the territory of the town Irpin is characterized by moderate anthropogenic impact, while Boyarka and Vyshneve demonstrated a high level of anthropogenic impact. The total area of the environmental fund on the territory of cities ranges from 13.9% (Vyshneve) to 47.5% (Irpin) of the total area of their territories, which is insufficient in all cases. Currently, the territory of Irpin is the most balanced in comparison with other towns. Implementation of the new Master Plans of the cities will improve the ecological balance of the Boyarka and Irpin areas; improvement in Boyarka will be notably extensive due to the expansion of the city boundaries by a threefold increase in the town's area. The projected general development of Vyshneve will worsen the ecological balance of its territory, despite the foreseen expansion of its boundaries. The pressure from the ecological and economic status of the territories is not balanced by the degree of anthropogenic impact and the potential of the sustainability of nature. For the territory of towns, the potential for sustainability of nature is significantly exceeded and requires the expansion of the environment of a stabilizing group of lands. The areas of towns within the existing boundaries are environmentally unstable, the tensions in the ecological and economic conditions of the territories are not balanced, which testify to their ineffective organization. A significant correlation has been found between the calculated coefficients and the area percentage of the environmental fund of urban areas. The obtained data testifies to the expediency of using the indicated eco-geographical indicators within the system of general planning in order to optimize prospective solutions.

AB  - Building integrated photovoltaic systems are fast becoming a feature of urban landscapes in France and other countries tackling similar pressures to improve the energy footprint of residential and commercial building sectors. As active components of building envelopes, the technology represents a promising solution to the local electrical and thermal demand. However, despite significant recent interest and investment into the technology, few studies have been undertaken to study full-scale installations operating under real conditions.
   In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of a prototype naturally-ventilated photovoltaic double-skin facade, designed to maintain favourable operating conditions for electrical performance by utilising the stack effect to cool photovoltaic components whilst improving the thermal performance of the building to which it is attached. Developed to meet both technical and aesthetic specifications, the prototype comprises a two-storey, vertically pleated, tinted glazed facade with a heterogeneous arrangement of photovoltaic cells electrically grouped into a vertical stack of three arrays. Installed on the West-North-West facade of an occupied office building in Toulouse, France, the component was tailored to the specific requirements of building into which it was incorporated. The result is a complex system in terms of geometry and environment. The objectives of the study were to test the assumption that the behaviour of simplified double-skin components can be generalised to real multifunction systems, and to propose analysis techniques suitable for this context. The prototype was instrumented to monitor the minute-wise thermal, electrical and air flow behaviour during the first year of operation. We present an analysis approach adapted to both the complexity of the system and the size of the dataset, wherein data were first classed according to daily indicators of environmental conditions using aggregated database queries. Periods of normal and anomalous behaviour were distinguished using data visualisation techniques. As well as assessing the daily and seasonal variation in performance, the predictability of system was also tested as a function of environmental conditions by means of stationary empirical models for heat extraction and array temperature. Despite the inherent complexity and the limitations of approximate or incomplete instrumentation, the system was found to behave in a predictable manner and could be described by simple relationships between environmental conditions and system state.

AB  - The aim of the article. To disclose the features of the sustainable development estimation rate for cities and metropolitan areas. To develop evaluation criteria of metropolitan areas logistization.
   The results of the analysis. The issue of sustainable development of cities and agglomerations became especially acute, primarily due to the socio-economic crisis, difficult environmental situation, inefficient, irrational and uncontrolled use of socio-ecological and economic resources. It is proved that the city is a logistics system. Based on the existing criteria reasonably precondition for sustainable development of cities and agglomerations which should be completed balanced. These preconditions include: adaptation of the cities to the internal and external factors with preserving of the socio-ecological-economic security, change of consumption of resources and their structure (more efficient use of domestic renewable resources and non-renewable external resources by urban flows); balance between consumption and reproduction of socio-ecological and economic resources, the expanded reproduction of socio-ecological and economic resources. Information entropy as a function of the state, allowing the best to describe the behavior of public multicomponent dynamic systems, is to be put into basis of the evaluation of sustainable development of cities and metropolitan areas. It is proved that the feature of evaluation of sustainable development of cities and metropolitan areas is considering rational use of socio-environmental and economic resources, reproduction a socio-environmental and economic resource, the state of socio-ecological-economic security, a balance between economic, environmental and social components of sustainable development, the level of logistization in urban and metropolitan areas. Since the city and the metropolitan area are open, dynamic, multicomponent systems, applying the method of producing maximum entropies is best for the assessment of sustainable development. Indicator of the state is considered as the realization of some random variable, provided in the form of time series data in order to solve the problem of calculating the entropy indicators. Scientific novelty is definition of the resource and management efficiency of each city that belongs to the metropolitan area, definition of the agglomerative component that provides assessment agglomerative factor, indicator agglomeration and logistization of metropolitan area that allows to find the expediency of entering the city of the metropolitan area in the context of inter-regional economic connections.
   Conclusions and directions of further researches. Sustainable development of Ukrainian metropolitan areas is evaluated due to the proposed integrated indicators. Methodical approach to the evaluation of sustainable development of cities and metropolitan areas is formed. It will contribute to the development of strategic principles of sustainable development of cities and metropolitan areas according to their features.

AB  - The Ecological ICMS is an economic instrument identified as an important strategy for associating municipal budget increase with biodiversity conservation via the creation and maintenance of protected areas. This article aims to comprehend the criterion of protected areas on ICMS-E applied in different Brazilian state laws. The group carried out an analysis of the ICMS-E legislations of 16 Brazilian States that apply the fiscal instrument, to identify the criterion of protected areas for revenue allocation. It was identified the States which employ protected areas as an environmental criterion on ICMS-E, as well as the typologies of the protected areas contemplated by the States and the indicators used for the criterion's evaluation. The results reveal that 15 States apply the criterion for protected areas in the ICMS-E, absent only in the state of Ceara. The group noted the inclusion of eight typologies by the States, with the most widely adopted being the Conservation Units (CU), and the Indigenous Lands. Although present in 10 States govenunent law, the qualitative evaluation of protected areas is still incipient, deserving note that Parana has improved the instrument's monitoring system. It must be emphasized the need to better adapt the indicators and variables of the CU evaluation according to the characteristics of each management category; the insufficiency of the ICMS-E in the Northeast Region of Brazil and the problems related to the absence of the protected areas criterion in Ceara, which has a significant role in conserving the Caatinga. Due to the relevance of the criterion of protected areas in the ICMS-E allocation, it's recommended to elaborate and operationalize them true to the difficulty faced by the States, in articulation with Brazilian's biomes conservation goals, and the prioritization of certain qualitative evaluation so the ICMS-E may have its compensatory and incentive potential exploited in the conservation of Brazilian's biodiversity.

AB  - Background: Air pollution exposure is an environmental risk to public health. And the available data on relationships of air pollution and neonatal disease burden are scarce. This study assessed neonatal disease burden attributable to Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) pollution in China.Methods: This is a retrospective analysis with data from the GBD2019 database. Data of PM 2.5 pollution exposure levels and neonatal disease burden attributable to PM 2.5 in China from 1990 to 2019 were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019); Data of PM2.5 concentration was collected from the Bulletin of the State of the Ecological Environment in China; Data of perinatal mortality was collected from the Chinese Maternal and Child Health Surveillance Network. Deaths, Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), Year of life lost (YLLs), and Years lived with disability (YLDs) are primary indicators used to assess neonatal diseases burden. The correlation of PM2.5 pollution and neonatal death was analyzed. Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC) and increment were used to assess exposure levels and disease burden trends.Results: PM 2.5 pollution exposure level of newborns in China is much higher than global average, 32.08 per 100 people (95% UI: 26.57-38.06) in 2019 compared to 1990 (15.86 per 100 people, 95% UI: 6.83-30.88), with an increase of 102.27%. And it is statistically verified PM2.5 concentration was positively correlated with neonatal disease deaths (r = 0.9534, p = 0.0009) and DALYs (r = 0.9534, p = 0.0009). The overall disease burden of neonatal diseases attributed to PM 2.5 pollution in China has decreased from 1990 to 2019, with a decrement of 5738.34 deaths (decreased: 56.85%), 51.01 person/years (decreased: 56.84%) for DALYs, 51.23 person/years (decreased: 57.11%) for YLLs and an increase of 150.69 person/years (increased: 31.71%) for YLDs.Conclusion: There exists positive correlation between environmental pollution and neonatal diseases in China. The number of neonatal disease deaths, DALYs, and YLLs due to PM 2.5 pollution showed a decreasing trend with the environmental pollution control. For the rising YLDs, there is a need to improve survival rates while focusing on prognosis of neonatal disease and reducing the burden of disease brought on by disability. Controlling environmental pollution is likely to help reduce neonatal disease burden, especially premature birth and neonatal encephalopathy.

KW  - Review of LCA studies
AB  - Numerous life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been conducted on the environmental impacts of beverage packaging systems. With such a potentially rich source of knowledge available, it seemed worthwhile to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of those existing studies. This paper describes a recent 'meta analysis', whose goal it was to provide a structured overview of LCAs on beverage cartons and other packaging systems from past years in order to answer two key questions: (1) Is it possible to draw general conclusions regarding the environmental performance (in terms of strengths and weaknesses) of beverage cartons in comparison to alternative packaging systems from these existing LCAs? (2) If certain trends arise across these LCA studies regarding the environmental performance of beverage cartons compared to other packaging systems for beverages, what can be said on their validity and limitations?
   The meta analysis presented covers 22 LCA studies, all of which fulfil three criteria: (1) full life cycle approach, (2) beverage carton must be among the products evaluated in study, and (3) comparative approach. Each of these studies was categorised either as a core study (if focussed on Europe, conducted in 2000 or later, and peer reviewed) or as a basic study. Next to providing detailed comparisons of the analysed studies, the full report on the meta analysis was designed to allow a quick understanding of their main characteristics (or 'profiles'). Similarities and differences were highlighted both in terms of results and the applied methodologies (e.g., key settings) and the validity and limitations of the findings were stated. Additionally, further environment-related topics of special interest to stakeholders in the beverage packaging industry were addressed.
   For certain environmental impact indicators/inventory categories, the LCA studies covered in this meta analysis indicate general trends regarding the performance of beverage cartons versus alternative packaging systems. For climate change, cumulated energy demand/fossil resource consumption, and acidification, all regarded by the majority of all studies, beverage cartons mostly have the most favourable results, while in terms of land use for forestry, they clearly require the largest area. For summer smog and terrestrial eutrophication, the result 'pattern' points towards a favourable picture for beverage cartons; however, fewer LCA studies provide results for these impact categories. For other environmental aspects, where the results of the analysed studies vary strongly, no clear pattern can be made out. Several aspects were covered in too few LCA studies in order for an overall trend or lack thereof to become visible, and still others-which in part have been receiving increased attention in the past years-are not addressed in any of the analysed core or basic studies.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify environmental risks and economic problems of the formation of the national ecological network and development directions of 'green" tourism in the recreational and protected areas in the context of the transition to sustainable development. Methodology. The abstract-logical method (in the process of theoretical generalizations and the formation of conclusions); methods of statistical, structural, and factor analysis (in the process of studying the structure and dynamics of the development of ecological networks); empirical research methods (comparison) are used. In preparing the article, the authors analysed the works of scientists, which reflect approaches to the definition of the role of ecological networks, the natural potential of recreational areas in the transition to sustainable development. Changes in nature are evaluated through indicators of the dynamics of areas of the nature reserve fund, which form the national ecological network. Results. According to the results of the study, it is determined that the area of Ukrainian land belonging to the components of the national ecological network increased by 2013 thousand hectares in comparison with 2000, but since 2014 this area has decreased by 0.6 thousand hectares. The area of forests and forest cover area increased by 2.8 thousand hectares, and the area of grassland and pasture fell by 7.8 thousand hectares.There is a tendency to increase the area of arable land, since 2014 it has increased by 15.8 thousand hectares and is 32541.3 thousand hectares. Compared to 2014, the area of land under open development, quarries, mines, and related structures (157.1 thousand hectares) has increased by 0.8 thousand hectares and the land area used for transport and communication (496.8 thousand hectares) has increased (by 0.1 thousand hectares). In 2016, 32.5 billion UAH were spent on the protection of the environment by enterprises, organizations, and institutions of Ukraine, and in 2015 - 24.6 billion UAH respectively. Practical implications. The necessity of elaboration of regional measures to develop "green infrastructure" of ecosystem services is determined. In the regions of Ukraine, it is necessary to develop balanced approaches to the use of the potential of nature conservation area of tourist nature use, international experience of implementing cross-border tourism projects in the Carpathian National Nature Park, and to form integrated investment regional tourism projects of ecological orientation. State policy in the field of recreational nature management should regulate the development of recreation and tourism sphere, first of all, in view of compliance with the requirements of ecologically balanced use of natural resources and ecologically balanced development of territories. The introduction of green tourism development lines will have a positive effect on the formation of ecological networks. Particularly, these measures are necessary to find additional investments for environmental protection measures and the development of ecological networks in Ukraine. Value/originality. In regions of Ukraine, it is necessary to begin work on the creation of a network of hiking and cycle routes in nature protection recreational territories and in regional nature parks. Their operation will enable the development of ecological networks, green tourism, and ecological areas of hospitality in the country.

AB  - The United States Clean Water Act (CWA; 1972, and as amended, U.S. Code title 33, sections 1251-1387) provides the long-term, national objective to "restore and maintain the... biological integrity of the Nation's waters" (section 1251). However, the Act does not define the ecological components, or attributes, that constitute biological integrity nor does it recommend scientific methods to measure the condition of aquatic biota. One way to define biological integrity was described over 25 years ago as a balanced, integrated, adaptive system. Since then a variety of different methods and indices have been designed and applied by each state to quantify the biological condition of their waters. Because states in the United States use different methods to determine biological condition, it is currently difficult to determine if conditions vary across states or to combine state assessments to develop regional or national assessments. A nationally applicable model that allows biological condition to be interpreted independently of assessment methods will greatly assist the efforts of environmental practitioners in the United States to (1) assess aquatic resources more uniformly and directly and (2) communicate more clearly to the public both the current status of aquatic resources and their potential for restoration.
   To address this need, we propose a descriptive model, the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) that describes how 10 ecological attributes change in response to increasing levels of stressors. We divide this gradient of biological condition into six tiers useful to water quality scientists and managers. The model was tested by determining how consistently a regionally diverse group of biologists assigned samples of macroinvertebrates or fish to the six tiers. Thirty-three macroinvertebrate biologists concurred in 81% of their 54 assignments. Eleven fish biologists concurred in 74% of their 58 assignments. These results support our contention that the BCG represents aspects of biological condition common to existing assessment methods. We believe the model is consistent with ecological theory and will provide a means to make more consistent, ecologically relevant interpretations of the response of aquatic biota to stressors and to better communicate this information to the public.

AB  - Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex ways that are difficult to predict. Coordinated long-term research and analysis are required to assess how these changes will affect a diverse array of ecosystem services. This paper is part of a series that is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network. This effort revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling scientific case study about "what their site would look like" in 50 or 100 yr. As the site results were prepared, themes emerged, and the case studies were grouped into separate papers along five themes: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects and compiled into this special issue. This paper addresses the time lags theme with five examples from diverse biomes including tundra (Arctic), coastal upwelling (California Current Ecosystem), montane forests (Coweeta), and Everglades freshwater and coastal wetlands (Florida Coastal Everglades) LTER sites. Its objective is to demonstrate the importance of different types of time lags, in different kinds of ecosystems, as drivers of ecosystem structure and function and how these can effectively be addressed with long-term studies. The concept that slow, interactive, compounded changes can have dramatic effects on ecosystem structure, function, services, and future scenarios is apparent in many systems, but they are difficult to quantify and predict. The case studies presented here illustrate the expanding scope of thinking about time lags within the LTER network and beyond. Specifically, they examine what variables are best indicators of lagged changes in arctic tundra, how progressive ocean warming can have profound effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton in waters off the California coast, how a series of species changes over many decades can affect Eastern deciduous forests, and how infrequent, extreme cold spells and storms can have enduring effects on fish populations and wetland vegetation along the Southeast coast and the Gulf of Mexico. The case studies highlight the need for a diverse set of LTER (and other research networks) sites to sort out the multiple components of time lag effects in ecosystems.

AB  - The work is the analysis of the technical aviation liquid for sanitary facilities of aircrafts "Skykem" using the method of zooindication. The obtained results can be used to control the state of the environment of airport services. Due to a small number of universal methods for studying and determining the environmental harmfulness of aviation technical substances, the study has scientific and practical significance. Determination of the degree of risk in the leakage of this fluid will allow aviation authorities to impose restrictions on the use of the systems of aircraft sanitary units of the substance. This step will lead to creation and adoption of environmentally friendly chemical liquids, the consequence will be reduction of environmental load on the pre-airport land. As the living material, the species of river snail (Viviparus viviparus L.) are selected, as one of the most common types of bioindicators in Moscow region. Experience is based on the change in the activity of two values: acid phosphatase and DNase. The experimental data allow us to observe the dynamics of the activity of acid phosphatase and DNase of the river snail (Viviparus viviparus L.) in response to acute toxic effects of technical aviation fluid "Skykem", as well as changes in the activity of investigated enzymes of experimental animals in normal conditions. It is shown that the activity of the studied enzymes varies in relation as to the original value, thus in the experimental group and the control group throughout the whole experiment in water without toxicant.
   During the analysis the degree of environmental hazard of the substance is determined, the extent of pollution of the site is calculated. Based on the analysis of laboratory data, the ways of solving the problem were found. Basing on the results, the threat to the environment is indicated, the graphs of changes in the activity of acid phosphatase and DNa of the river snail are built, for the first time the characteristics of negative environmental properties of the substance "Skykem" is given. The dynamics of changes are tracked in activity of enzymes when exposed to shellfish toxic substances. The degree of similarities and differences are evaluated in adaptive changes in the studied enzymes in a time interval. According to the results of the study the conclusions are drawn and recommendations for using this method in a production environment are given.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive requires all Member States to achieve good ecological quality status for all waters (e.g., transitional waters). For that purpose, Member States must assess water bodies based on information on the Biological Quality Elements listed for each of them (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates). However, the production of such a quality status classification (high, good, moderate, poor, bad) requires high reference conditions (associated with the absence of, or very low, human pressure) against which the deviation of the samples to be assessed can be measured. In transitional waters, upper stretches have seldom been included in monitoring activities, resulting in very little knowledge of mesohaline and oligohaline areas, which means further difficulty when defining the required reference conditions for these zones.
   Regarding the benthic macroinvertebrates, large datasets from the mesohaline and oligohaline stretches of the Mondego estuary (four seasons, five years, environmental parameters, density and biomass data) were used to estimate high reference condition values. In terms of environmental conditions, summer was identified as the most stable season and the most suitable for defining reference conditions for selected ecological indicators. For each indicator, the multivariate linear model expressing the best correlation with measured environmental parameters was selected. These models were used afterwards, by replacing the environmental parameters in those equations with their high reference values, to calculate the reference condition for each ecological indicator.
   Generally, macrobenthic communities within each stretch changed over the years, being mainly influenced by salinity and sediment organic matter. In both stretches, only a few taxa occurred and two species (the amphipod Corophium multisetosum and the bivalve Corbicula fluminea) were clearly dominant. Diversity values (for Margalef, Shannon and ES50 - Hurlbert indices) were low in both stretches, although higher in the mesohaline, and for the most part the ecological condition was low (AMBI - AZTI Marine Biotic Index, MEDDOC - Mediterranean Occidental index, BENTIX biotic index, BO2A - Benthic Opportunistic Annelida Amphipod index). On the whole, the RC estimated for each index followed the same trend, being different for each stretch and below those found for lower sections of the estuary in other surveys.

AB  - A comprehensive, yet in depth, assessment is needed of the environmental impacts of dairy farms at regional and national scales to better track improvements made by the industry. With Pennsylvania as an example, a method using process-level simulation and cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment was developed and used to assess important environmental footprints of dairy farms within a state. Representative dairy farms of various sizes and management practices throughout 7 regions of the state were simulated with the Integrated Farm System Model. Environmental footprints varied widely among farms, with this variation influenced primarily by soil characteristics and climate and secondarily by farm management. Therefore, prescriptive mitigation strategies for individual farms are more effective than uniform enforcement of specific strategies across the state. Footprints for the whole state were determined by totaling values among farms and regions based on the amounts of milk produced by each. Pennsylvania dairy farms were determined to emit 4,555 with an uncertainty of +/- 415 Gg of CO2 equivalent of greenhouse gas with an intensity of 0.99 +/- 0.09 kg of CO2 equivalent/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) produced. Fossil energy consumption was 12,324 +/- 1,946 T.J or 2.69 +/- 0.42 MJ/kg of FPCM. Blue (nonprecipitation) water consumption was 64.1 +/- 13.5 Tg with an intensity of 14.0 +/- 3.0 kg/kg of FPCM. A total of all forms of reactive N loss was 43.2 +/- 5.0 Gg with an intensity of 9.4 +/- 1.1 g/kg of FPCM. These metrics were equivalent to 1.6% of the green-house gas emissions, 0.4% of fossil energy use, and 0.8% of fresh water consumption reported for the state. Thus, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy use, and blue water use associated with dairy farm production are relatively small compared with total estimates for the state. Perhaps the greatest environmental concern is that of ammonia emission, where dairy farms accounted for about half the estimated emissions of the state. This method can be applied to assessments of the dairy industry at larger regional and national scales.

AB  - Given the current evidence of global change, extreme events are projected to be more frequent and intense. At a river basin scale, the immediate effects of hurricanes include changes in soil properties, vegetation structure and composition, and water volume and quality, which lead to changes in species distribution and community structure. The goal of this study was to identify key abiotic and biotic elements for monitoring hurricane events at the river basin scale by linking databases of vegetation cover, small mammal diversity and water quality between 2010 and 2016. Abiotic parameters and biotic communities were monitored in a tropical dry forest (TDF) landscape on the coast of Jalisco, Mexico after two major events: Hurricanes Jova (2011) and Patricia (2015). Three zones (1-upper, 2-middle and 3-lower basin) adjacent to the TDF were analyzed along the Cuitzmala River catchment areas before and after the events. We used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for vegetation greenness and the diversity index of a small mammal community of rodents and bats as indicators of terrestrial habitat quality, and Fecal Coliform (FC), Fecal Enterococci (FE), and Electrical Conductivity (EC) as indicators of the river-water condition. During the years of hurricanes (2011 and 2015) there was a decrease in the EVI and small mammal diversity, as well as changes in the concentration of FC, FE and EC. The main effects associated with the two hurricanes were observed in the lower basin where hurricanes made landfall and the forest had been converted to other land uses. The EVI, communities of small mammals, and abiotic and biotic water conditions were responsive to the effects of hurricanes and can thus be useful for a long-term ecological monitoring program at the basin scale. This program would allow a faster evaluation and response to future extreme meteorological events. Our results could be implemented through the Urban and Environmental Plans at the state level (Ordenamiento Territorial del Estado de Jalisco), through the regulation of sustainable agricultural and livestock techniques, and by educating local populations of the effects of extreme meteorological events.

CP  - Conference on Issues and Applications in Toxicology and Risk Assessment
AB  - The Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne, comprised of approximately 10,000 people, is located along the St. Lawrence River in upstate New York. The Akwesasne reservation has been contaminated by local industries, which are located on the St. Lawrence River and its tributaries, and by upstream sources on the Great Lakes. The closest known source of contamination to the reservation is General Motors (GM) Foundry, which is located less than 100 feet from the reservation's border. This facility is listed on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priority List and the New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation's (NYSDEC) inactive hazardous waste disposal site list. Contamination to the reservation arising from discharge and secondary transport mechanisms has caused concern to the Mohawk people of Akwesasne.
   The characterization of the environment at Akwesasne required a historical review of existing environmental data, generation of a database, review of existing data, sampling to augment existing data, data analysis, data modeling and data generation based on a chosen model for all environmental pathways of interest. The objectives this work were to: 1) assess the quality of existing data, 2) create a database which will manage the over 6000 samples recorded taken from the local area, 3) augment the existing data with additional sampling, 4) determine the degradation or attenuation of PCBs and specific congeners in various environmental media over time, and 5) create a model that estimates environmental concentrations of PCBs retro- and pro-spectively for times that sampling had not occurred.
   The results of this process yielded concentrations of PCBs, congener specific and total, in several environmental medium. Modeling of environmental concentrations through a thirteen-year time period was performed for a fish, wildlife and surface soil. Other media were not modeled due to limited information or non-detectable concentrations reported in past work. Additionally, the study participants activity, consumption and residential information was considered when limiting this modeling effort. The results of this work were used to estimate environmental concentrations through time and space. The results of this work were extremely valuable when determining areas of concern and provided the basis for a detailed exposure assessment of 97 women who reside at the Reservation.

AB  - Models of ecosystem change that incorporate nonlinear dynamics and thresholds, such as state-and-transition models (STMs), are increasingly popular tools for land management decision-making. However, few models are based on systematic collection and documentation of ecological data, and of these, most rely solely on structural indicators (species composition) to identify states and transitions. As STMs are adopted as an assessment framework throughout the United States, finding effective and efficient ways to create data-driven models that integrate ecosystem function and structure is vital. This study aims to (1) evaluate the utility of functional indicators (indicators of rangeland health, IRH) as proxies for more difficult ecosystem function measurements and (2) create a data-driven STM for the sagebrush steppe of Colorado, USA, that incorporates both ecosystem structure and function. We sampled soils, plant communities, and IRH at 41 plots with similar clayey soils but different site histories to identify potential states and infer the effects of management practices and disturbances on transitions. We found that many IRH were correlated with quantitative measures of functional indicators, suggesting that the IRH can be used to approximate ecosystem function. In addition to a reference state that functions as expected for this soil type, we identified four biotically and functionally distinct potential states, consistent with the theoretical concept of alternate states. Three potential states were related to management practices (chemical and mechanical shrub treatments and seeding history) while one was related only to ecosystem processes (erosion). IRH and potential states were also related to environmental variation (slope, soil texture), suggesting that there are environmental factors within areas with similar soils that affect ecosystem dynamics and should be noted within STMs. Our approach generated an objective, data-driven model of ecosystem dynamics for rangeland management. Our findings suggest that the IRH approximate ecosystem processes and can distinguish between alternate states and communities and identify transitions when building data-driven STMs. Functional indicators are a simple, efficient way to create data-driven models that are consistent with alternate state theory. Managers can use them to improve current model-building methods and thus apply state-and-transition models more broadly for land management decision-making.

AB  - The consumer responsibility approach uses footprints as indicators of the total direct and indirect effects of a product or consumption activity. This study used a time-series analysis of three environmental pressures to quantify the total environmental pressures caused by consumption in Taiwan: land footprint, carbon footprint, and water footprint. Land footprint is the pressure from appropriation of biologically productive land and water area. Carbon footprint is the pressure from greenhouse gas emissions. Water footprint is the pressure from freshwater consumption. Conventional carbon footprint is the total CO2 emitted by a certain activity or the CO2 accumulation during a product life cycle. This definition cannot be used to convert CO2 emissions into land units. This study responds to the needs of "CO2 land" in the footprint family by applying the carbon footprint concept used by GFN. The analytical results showed that consumption by the average Taiwan citizen in 2000 required appropriation of 539 gha (hectares of land with global-average biological productivity) and 3.63 gha in 2011 in terms of land footprint. The average Taiwan citizen had a carbon footprint of 3.95 gha in 2000 and 5.94 gha in 2011. These results indicate that separately analyzing the land and carbon footprints enables their trends to be compared and appropriate policies and strategies for different sectors to be proposed accordingly. The average Taiwan citizen had a blue water footprint of 801 m(3) in 2000 and 784 m(3) in 2011. By comparison, their respective global averages were 123 gha, 236 gha and 163 m(3) blue water in 2011, respectively. Overall, Taiwan revealed higher environmental pressures compared to the rest of the world, demonstrating that Taiwa'n has become a high footprint state and has appropriated environmental resources from other countries. That is, through its imports of products with embodied pressures and its exports, Taiwan has transferred the environmental pressures from consuming goods and services to other parts of the world, which is an environmental injustice. This study examines the time series trend of land, carbon, and water footprints in Taiwan. However, if these analyses can be downscaled to city/county levels, they will be more useful for examining different sustainability performance of local governments in different regions.

AB  - Monitoring of the oxidant/antioxidant state of the biological objects plays an important role in the detection of serious diseases in the early stages, the choice of therapy and evaluation of its effectiveness. This parameter is very important for understanding the processes occurring at the interfaces (biointerfaces)in living organisms, in particular, lipid bilayers of cell membranes and cellular organelles (mitochondria), etc. Under normal conditions and in physiological concentrations, active oxygen/nitrogen forms (ROS/ANA)are involved in the growth, differentiation, development, and death of cells, as well as in a number of other bioregulation processes, as natural signaling molecules. With an excessive generation of ROS/ANA oxidative stress develops, the result of which is the processes of oxidative destruction, occurring mainly on the biointerface and leading to apoptosis of cells and the appearance of pathological conditions. Disbalance between reactive oxygen/nitrogen (ROS/RNS)generation and activity of the antioxidant defense system is the cause of oxidative stress (OS)appearing. Antioxidant activity (AOA)of biological objects, as an integral parameter, is an indicator of the OS intensity. The paper presents a hybrid version of electrochemical methods for the determination of AOA, including a chemical signal- forming reaction that precedes or proceeds simultaneously with the recording of an analytical signal. The source of information on AOA (analytical signal)is: - the electrode potential shift that is observed when the sample is introduced into the mediator system- the mixture of 0.01M K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] + 0.0001M K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] (potentiometric variant); - the increment of K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] oxidation current, resulting from the interaction of the AO, containing in the sample, with the oxidized form of the mediator system-10(-2)M K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] previously introduced into the solution (chronoamperometric version). The method is applied to the analysis of saliva as a noninvasive alternative to invasive sampling blood fractions investigation. The existence of a relationship between oral diseases and the internal state of the body gives reason to believe that saliva's AOA can serve as a source of information on common health problems. Recovery of antioxidant standard addition introduced into analyzed sample is not less than 85.0% in chronoamperometry and 85.3% in chronopotentiometry. Reproducibility (Sr <= 8.87%). The values of Student's and Fisher's criteria (texp < ttheor and Fexp < Ftheor)indicate an insignificant difference in the results obtained by chronopotentiometric and chronopotentiometric methods.

AB  - Naturalness and hemeroby indicator values are specialized species-based indicators used in Continental Europe that reflect plant species' affinity to degraded habitats. Despite their potential utility for basic and applied science, their similarities have gone unnoticed, and they have yet to be studied together. Here, we combine literature review and novel data analyses to ask 1) How are the naturalness and hemeroby indicator systems related, and 2) Do naturalness and hemeroby indicator values reflect similar functional patterns? To address these questions, we first reviewed the conceptual and methodological differences underlying naturalness and hemeroby values. We then directly compared the indicator values, including splitting species by origin. Next, to determine if the values capture similar ecological patterns, we related the indicator values to leaf traits, specifically leaf area, dry matter content, and specific leaf area. The main conceptual difference we identified was the differing reference states of the systems: naturalness values are value-laden and emphasize a lack of human influence, whereas hemeroby values are evaluative and apply the potential natural vegetation concept. Naturalness and hemeroby indicators have contrasting resolutions on opposite ends of the naturalness/degradation continuum, with naturalness placing greater emphasis on lightly impacted areas, whereas hemeroby divides degraded contexts more finely. Overall, naturalness and hemeroby values were inversely related. Naturalness and hemeroby values were strongly (rho < -0.6) correlated in direct comparisons. These correlations were curvilinear due to the scoring differences for non-native species: the systems had contrasting score variances (i.e., resolution) between non-native and native species. Leaf traits were generally "mirror images" between the systems; hemeroby was negatively associated with dry matter content and positively associated with specific leaf area, and vice versa for naturalness.. However, these relationships were weak (R-2 < 0.05). The weakness of these patterns implies that species' degradation tolerance may not be generalizable by simple leaf traits. Our work showed that hemeroby and naturalness are inverse, bilaterally consistent indicator systems. These indicator values, or improved versions of them, could be better utilized in the future for applied management and conservation.

AB  - Forest leaf chlorophyll (C-ab) and carotenoid (C-xc) are key functional indicators for the state of the forest ecosystem. Current machine learning models based on hyperspectral reflectance are widely applied to estimate leaf C-ab and C-xc contents at leaf scale. However, these models have certain accuracy for non-independent datasets but have poor generalization for independent datasets when they are used to estimate leaf C-ab and C-xc contents. This fact limits that hyperspectral remote sensing completely replaces destructive measurements for leaf C-ab and C-xc contents. Thus, the development of an estimation model with high accuracy and satisfactory generalization is necessary. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have certain accuracy and generalization in many domains, and have the potential to solve above-mentioned problem. Therefore, this study developed a CNN using onedimensional hyperspectral reflectance, which aimed to improve the model's accuracy and generalization in leaf C-ab and C-xc content estimation at leaf scale. The proposed CNN was developed by three steps. First, in consideration of the correlation between leaf C-ab and C-xc contents in natural leaves, 2500 physical data with leaf reflectance and corresponding C-ab and C-xc contents were generated by leaf radiative transfer model and multi variable gaussian distribution function. Then, the proposed CNN was built by five strategies based on the architecture of the AlexNet. Finally, five-fold cross validation was performed with 70% of the physical data to determine the best strategy to develop the proposed CNN. These were executed to ensure the proposed CNN with the maximum accuracy and generalization. In addition, the accuracy and generalization of the proposed CNN were tested using a non-independent dataset and an independent dataset, respectively. The proposed CNN was also compared with back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR) and gaussian process regression (GPR). Results showed that the best CNN could be developed with one input, five convolutional, three max-pooling and three fully-connected layers. Comprehensively considering the model's accuracy and generalization, the proposed CNN was the best model for leaf C-ab and C-xc content estimation compared with BPNN, SVR and GPR. This study provides a development strategy of CNN estimation model using onedimensional hyperspectral reflectance at leaf scale. The proposed CNN could further promote the practical application of hyperspectral remote sensing in leaf C-ab and C-xc content estimation.

AB  - The methods of network environ analysis (NEA) currently apply to steady-state models. Networks of real ecosystems are near steady-state in long-term mean characteristics, but are dynamic in short-term responses. A formal mathematical approach to dynamic NEA analysis has never been fully developed, though Hippe [Hippe, P.W, 1983. Environ analysis of linear compartmental systems: the dynamic, time-invariant case. Ecol. Model. 19, 1-26] offers one approach. Another potential approach to addressing this limitation is to analyze a discrete-time series of steady-state models, each a snapshot for the time period it represents. Using concepts from open-loop control theory, four throughflow-based ecological control terms (control ratio, CR; control difference, CD; system control, sc(j); and total system control, TC) as developed using an environ framework are evaluated for 16 consecutive seasons of nitrogen cycling in the Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA. Results of this assessment offer a quantitative measure of the quasi-dynamic distributed control in this network. The NOx and Sediment components assume opposing but dominant roles (high sc(j) magnitudes) in all 16 seasons. Low total compartmental throughflow (T-i) to respective boundary inflow (z(i)) or outflow (y(j)) ratios are shown to be indicators of component control dominance, suggesting a role for boundary flows in the consideration of a system component's dominance. This conclusion may also be a property of the high cycling nature of this nitrogen model (average Finn cycling index of 89% for all 16 seasons). TC appears to be correlated with total system throughflow (TST), suggesting that TST may indicate a system's distributed control patterns. This correlation may likewise be fruitful if TST proves to be an indicator for system stability, an important and logical consideration in the notion of control. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Poor coordination of care across providers and birth settings has been associated with adverse maternal-newborn outcomes. Research suggests that integration of midwives into regional health systems is a key determinant of optimal maternal-newborn outcomes, yet, to date, the characteristics of an integrated system have not been described, nor linked to health disparities.
   Methods
   Our multidisciplinary team examined published regulatory data to inform a 50-state database describing the environment for midwifery practice and interprofessional collaboration. Items (110) detailed differences across jurisdictions in scope of practice, autonomy, governance, and prescriptive authority; as well as restrictions that can affect patient safety, quality, and access to maternity providers across birth settings. A nationwide survey of state regulatory experts (n = 92) verified the 'on the ground' relevance, importance, and realities of local interpretation of these state laws. Using a modified Delphi process, we selected 50/110 key items to include in a weighted, composite Midwifery Integration Scoring (MISS) system. Higher scores indicate greater integration of midwives across all settings. We ranked states by MISS scores; and, using reliable indicators in the CDC-Vital Statistics Database, we calculated correlation coefficients between MISS scores and maternal-newborn outcomes by state, as well as state density of midwives and place of birth. We conducted hierarchical linear regression analysis to control for confounding effects of race.
   Results
   MISS scores ranged from lowest at 17 (North Carolina) to highest at 61 (Washington), out of 100 points. Higher MISS scores were associated with significantly higher rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery, vaginal birth after cesarean, and breastfeeding, and significantly lower rates of cesarean, preterm birth, low birth weight infants, and neonatal death. MISS scores also correlated with density of midwives and access to care across birth settings. Significant differences in newborn outcomes accounted for by MISS scores persisted after controlling for proportion of African American births in each state.
   Conclusion
   The MISS scoring system assesses the level of integration of midwives and evaluates regional access to high quality maternity care. In the United States, higher MISS Scores were associated with significantly higher rates of physiologic birth, less obstetric interventions, and fewer adverse neonatal outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to model the multifactorial dependencies between normal and excessive inequality and real income per capita, as well as establishing interrelationships between the types of inequality and the indicators of human capital quality, living standards and welfare of population in the regions of the Russian Federation.
   The methodology of the study. The double deflation method based on the indicator of relative cost of living in regions was used for determination of real incomes. The inequality level was assessed by use of the Gini coefficient. The division of inequality into normal and excessive types was carried out by means of the A. Yu. Shevjakov method applying three functional thresholds (poverty, social minimum and social prosperity). The OLS method was used for econometric estimation of the relationships between the types of inequality and the economic development indicators. The correlation of the inequality types with the indicators of quality of human capital, living standards and welfare of the population was determined based on the Pearson coefficient.
   The results of the study. We developed the multifactor econometric models estimating interrelationships of normal and excessive inequalities with a number of variables, including real income per capita. The S. Kuznets's dependence was confirmed for the normal inequality of levels I and II. We found that the normal inequality of level III is positively related to real income per capita, while excessive inequality of all levels is negatively connected with it. We revealed that in regions with a higher level of normal inequality and a lower level of excessive inequality there are on average better the following indicators: 1) the quality of human capital (the state of health and education); 2) the standard of living (some indicators of population dynamics, the structure of consumer spending, the state of the legal environment, culture, recreation and tourism); 3) the welfare of the population (housing, durable goods, pure real savings and free time).
   Application of the results. The results obtained are applicable in managing the socio- economic processes at the regional and federal levels.

AB  - Since 1857 new Australians have constructed many thousands of weirs (3600 in the Murray-Darling Basin alone) and floodplain levee banks, 446 large dams (> 10 m crest height) and over 50 intra- and inter-basin water transfer schemes to secure water supplies for human use. Flow regulation has changed the hydrology of major rivers on three temporal sales-the flood pulse (days to weeks), flow history (weeks to years) and the long-term statistical pattern of flows, or flow regime (decades or longer). The regulation of river flows is widely acknowledged as a major cause of deteriorating conditions in many Australian river and floodplain ecosystems. In response to mounting environmental concerns, all states, territories and the Commonwealth Government have committed the nation to the principles of ecologically sustainable development and a process of national water reform. Rivers and wetlands are now recognized as legitimate 'users' of water, and jurisdictions must provide water allocations to sustain and where necessary restore ecological processes and the biodiversity of water-dependent ecosystems. Progress in the protection and restoration of river and wetland water regimes has been significant, with over half of mainland aquatic systems designated to receive water allocations of some sort. However, exactly how much water they will receive or retain is unclear from the data available. Moreover, the ecological outcomes and benefits of water allocations are not yet apparent in most aquatic ecosystems, with the exception of certain waterbird breeding events, the disruption of algal blooms in weirs and improved fish passage. After reviewing these issues, this paper addresses two vital questions: How much water does a river need? and How can this water be clawed back from other users? Studies conducted to date in Queensland rivers suggest that around 80-92% of natural mean annual flow (and other ecologically relevant hydrological indicators) may be needed to maintain a low risk of environmental degradation. In the Top End of the Northern Territory, some rivers are maintained at 80% of their natural flow, whereas two-thirds of various flow indicators has been proposed as the restoration target for the River Murray, and 28% of natural mean annual flow has been negotiated for the Snowy River in Victoria. To validate these estimates, ecologists are seeking opportunities to turn river restoration projects into long-term hypothesis-driven experiments in ecological restoration, and the funding, time and institutional support to do so. The paper ends with some suggestions to advance the water reforms and achieve higher levels of water allocation for the environment. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time-and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework. We fit models with and without (independent or autocorrelated) random effects on NAA, M, and selectivity to data from five stocks with a broad range of life history, fishing pressure, number of ages, and time-series length. Models that included random effects performed well across stocks and processes, especially random effects models with a two dimensional (2D) first-order autoregressive, AR(1), covariance structure over age and year. We conducted simulation tests and found negligible or no bias in estimation of important assessment outputs (SSB, F, stock status, and catch) when the operating and estimation models matched. However, bias in SSB and F was often non-trivial when the estimation model was less complex than the operating model, especially when models without random effects were fit to data simulated from models with random effects. Bias of the variance and correlation parameters controlling random effects was also negligible or slightly negative as expected. Our results suggest that WHAM can be a useful tool for stock assessment when environmental effects on R or M, or stochastic variation in NAA transitions, M, or selectivity are of interest. In the U.S. Northeast, where the productivity of several groundfish stocks has declined, conducting assessments in WHAM with time-varying processes via random effects or environment-productivity links may account for these trends and potentially reduce retrospective bias.

AB  - The necessary basis for studying the structure and dynamics of populations is an investigation of ontomophogenetic peculiarities and establishment of ontogenetic stages of individuals. Information about ontomorphogenesis is especially important for protected species of plants. The minimal amount of data on morphology of plants in the different periods of ontogenesis complicates plant identification and evaluation of population state conditions in nature and culture. Trifolium rubens L. is a perennial Central European plant listed in the Red Book of Ukraine as a rare species. The objective of this research is to analyze the peculiarities of ontomorphogenesis of T. rubens, to establish diagnostic signs of age stages and the sequence of their passage for identification of the multivariance of development. The results of the study on T. rubens ontomorphogeny at the M. M. Gryshko National Botanical Garden.f the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and in the natural population in Zakarpattya are represented in this article. The terms "age stage" and "age period" are used to describe the degree of ontogenetic development of individuals. Diagnostic features of the age periods: latent, pregenerative, generative and senile are established. Detailed morphological descriptions of plants in different stages of ontogenesis are presented. The study shows a multivariate development that reveals different sequences of passing ontogenesis stages by individuals and, accordingly, the rate of their aging and life expectancy. It was found that during the first year of vegetation the plants undergo two periods (latent and pregenerative) and 5 stages of ontogeny (latent, seedlings, juvenile, immature and virginile). The first bloom in plants appears mainly in the second year of vegetation. The research showed the change of the leaf blade shape in ontogeny from simple to compound. There is a difference in the pubescence of leaf parts, and leaf shape indicates that these features are age-old. It was concluded that the aboveground part of the immature, virginile, generative individuals during the flowering period of plants differ from subsenile and senile in shape and number of leaves. In the generative period of ontogeny in dense plantings or in the natural population, it is difficult to reliably determine the boundaries of an individual by the aboveground part. The correlation between vegetative shoots of different type and generative shoots in the individual or group of plants can be used as an indicator to estimate the ontogenetic status of a particular locus or population. Successful growth of T. rubens in culture outside the natural range indicates good prospects for its ex situ protection and the implementation of measures for repatriation and restoration of populations in nature. The data of the research may be used for evaluation of the age structure of T. rubens populations.

AB  - Urgency of the research. The article describes the main proposals according regulation national market of fish products in the context of formation of global product systems and regional markets. The recommendations for influence on the supply of marketable fish and the production of fish-planting material in Ukraine.
   Target setting. The article aims at studying the problematic aspects of isolation and development of modern market regulation measures of aquaculture products.
   Authors have made emphasis on the needing to provide guidance for the purpose of calculation of key indicators marketable of fish production in Ukraine.
   Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. Addressing the same agricultural market occupies a leading place in scientific works S. Kvasha, M. Hazudy, L. Shynkaruk and other scientists. However, despite the significant number of publications and the fairly extensive research of market functioning, features aquaculture production agrarian market only focuses on fragmented and not always taken into account at its state in specific production periods.
   Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. The main problem that hinders the necessary level of aquaculture products development is the lacks of methodological component. For fully estimate of output of marketable fish that comes from farms, not just in the amount of legal fishery producers, with purpose to influence on supply of fish on the market.
   The research objective is developing of methodological recommendations for the calculation of key indicators of marketable fish production in Ukraine according to the integration processes in economic development.
   The statement of basic materials. Over the past fifty years, the global supply of food fish exceeded the growth rates of the world. Now the fish products form an important source of food and calorie of animal protein for the inhabitants of the globe. After entering the exclusive economic zones, fishing in most states recognized the limited natural resource base and is focused on supply of aquaculture products. Thus, in the article is the developing of recommendations for calculation of the annual performance payments marketable fish production in Ukraine.
   Conclusions. After calculation of output of marketable fish in the absence or lack of data for some indicators or territories ( areas) for adjustment of parameters to improve the reliability of the calculations should use additional sources of information.

AB  - Despite the growing awareness of the important ecological functions and values provided by coastal and estuarine wetlands, wetland degradation continues worldwide due to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Chongming Dongtan wetlands, adjacent to Shanghai, the largest city and industrial and trading port in China in rapid urban expansion and socioeconomic development are currently threatened with biodiversity reduction, wetland loss, contamination, and invasion of exotic plant. Sustainable protection and management of Dongtan Nature Reserve necessitate research to develop diagnostic tools and indicators for a comprehensive and objective assessment of wetland ecosystem health condition. Based on the pressure-state-response framework and ecological and environmental surveys at the Dongtan wetlands, an indicator system was established for evaluating the coastal wetlands ecosystem health, using indicators detected from satellite imagery and current field surveys. Through the establishment of health assessment units and spatial quantification of the indicators, the spatial clustering analysis, integrated with remote sensing and geographic information system technique was applied to make an accurate diagnosis of ecosystem health for Chongming Dongtan wetlands and highlight the areas in subhealthy and unhealthy condition and urgent need of conservation and management. The results from this research indicated that the ecosystem health condition at the Dongtan wetlands showed spatial variation, to a certain extent, corresponding to the distributions of elevation and land cover types. More than 75 % of the total study area was at a relatively healthy level, with 34.19 km(2) for the very healthy zone and 41.08 km(2) for the healthy zone, while the subhealthy and unhealthy zones covered 18.23 and 4.76 km(2), respectively. This study demonstrated the potential for this integrated approach to give objective and effective evaluation of ecosystem health for the dynamic coastal and estuarine wetlands and provide up-to-date information to assist with early warning for ecological security and management decisions for Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve.

AB  - Ecosystem services are usually interpreted as a free of charge "favour" provided to us and our society by nature. In other words, nature supplies us with a functionality that we would otherwise have to pay for. Our cost would be to provide resources either (1) to ensure the necessary inputs to drive our society, or (2) to assist in counteracting, absorbing or remediating unwanted effects that are results of our societal activities. Through ecosystem studies it has been found that a substantial part of the functionality of nature is laid out in all types of components-the compartments of the ecosystems together with the transactional interrelations (flows) and controls between them. Eventually, many so-called indicators have been proposed during the last decades. Such measures are dedicated to tell us about the quality side of ecosystem functionality, e.g. to tell us how well the system performs relatively to a theoretical maximum efficiency possible. As an additional hypothesis, such functions are thought to orient the systems and thus increase through time development, i.e. to be optimised under the given the constraints, through the evolution of the system. Recently is has been pointed out that natural and societal systems share the feature of being complex in their organisation. Meanwhile, it was remarked that societal systems in many ways evolved in opposite direction of how natural evolution would drive an ecosystem. Many philosophers of biology have stated that biological systems posses information and memory functions which improve their long-term capability to survive. This information is believed to be contained in the organisational structures of the system as much as in its gene pool. If we accept such arguments it means that studies of organisation and function of natural systems will provide us with another type of ecosystem services. This would namely give us information about in what direction to drive society in order to achieve a more sustainable system.
   This paper discusses what measures derived from modern ecosystem theory can possibly be used to study and compare the functionality of the two types of systems. The discussion takes an entrance point in two graphs-one that represents a natural system and one of a socio-economic system. The systems possess similar levels of complexity in terms of number of compartments whereas their connectivities do differ in quantity and quality. The differences between the systems are compared from both a network and a thermodynamic perspective. Indications of the best available options that we have at present, will help to increase our knowledge about and understanding of the systems given. As a main conclusion it is possible to view and treat our society as an ecosystem. This means that it is possible to apply the same measures (indicators) that we use in ecological theory. The idea to use these features is so clear, obvious and at the same time cheap that this option necessarily has to be tried out. It seems a bit surprising that we - from a "natural science point-of-view" - to a certain extent understand natural systems better than socio-economic ones. One major reason is that the latter type includes a large set of regulatory mechanisms that are exerted on a subjective basis as opposed to natural systems. As a consequence societal systems become much more difficult to evaluate, forecast and regulate than ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to modern animal welfare legislation, animals should be protected from suffering and lasting harm not for the benefit of us humans as in earlier anthropocentric conceptions, but in their own interest. The driving force behind animal protection is our empathy with animals which triggers feelings of compassion. Empathy with animals most likely is a psychological side-effect of adaptive empathy among humans, and its expression is largely determined by the degree of similarity between animals and us in morphology and behaviour. As a result, compassion with animals is vulnerable to anthropocentric bias, prejudice, and deception, and animal protection based on compassion is likely to be unfair towards animals. Moreover, from an ethological perspective, protecting animals in their own interest represents true altruism which places considerable ethical demand on us. However, there may be hidden selfish intentions that question the altruistic nature of animal protection, while at the same time facilitating its implementation. For example, animal protection could help to avoid unpleasant feelings induced by witnessing cruel actions towards animals. Alternatively, exhibiting a caring personality towards animals could represent human social behaviour that pays off indirectly through building up a caring reputation. It is, therefore, important to distinguish between our intention to protect animals (which may be partly selfish) and true animal protection that needs to be justified biologically by values that apply to the animals. Based on the sentientist nature of animal welfare legislation, the greatest challenges to applied ethologists, and important ones as testified by this special issue, are (i) to determine sentience in animals and (ii) to establish valid and reliable measures of affective states Such as suffering and well-being. However, there are promising measures of animal welfare beyond measures of affective states. In particular, biologically meaningful measures of 'integrity of form and function' may provide powerful indicators of animal welfare. The integrity concept originates in biocentric ethics and goes beyond sentientism, as it can also be applied to non-sentient animals and even plants. However, when applied to (potentially) sentient animals. it appears to be consistent with Our common sense notion of animal welfare which also respects the animals' 'nature' or 'telos'. Moreover, the integrity concept would relieve scientists from solving the 'hard problem' of animal consciousness first, or from establishing valid measures of demand or aversion that are notoriously difficult to establish.

AB  - The article presents the results of a survey conducted in the years 2013-2014. It concerned current and planned educational cooperation (within the framework of activities in the field of nature protection in the broad sense) between the administration of landscape parks and forest districts of the State Forests. Information was obtained from 86 landscape parks (out of 122 in Poland), located to a greater extent on the outskirts of Poland. Current and future educational cooperation was reported in 61 landscape parks, mainly in the south of the country. A total of 250 joint educational initiatives in 115 forest districts were identified. Projects related to the educational infrastructure prevailed (46.2% of all initiatives), and among them - those related to the creation of new and maintaining and modernization of existing didactic trails. In addition to their educational function, attention was also paid to organizing and limiting the visitors pressure to the natural environment. Another group of joint ventures were educational activities (30.0%), in particular field natural science classes and trips, fostering education of an active character, with higher efficiency than in the case of passive education. They usually have a mass character, and fulfil educational and upbringing functions. The respondents choose joint ventures of a scientific nature (3.2%) and related to the preparation of educational materials (4.4%) the least frequently. The proposed research was to include the influence of educated people on the environment and the assessment of ecological awareness of tourists and local residents. In turn, the most frequently mentioned educational material were information boards. The large involvement of respondents in completing surveys indicates that the administration of landscape parks is actively interested in the issues of nature conservation and ecological education in the State Forests. Current and planned joint educational projects include mainly such initiatives as creating and maintaining educational trails and organizing educational campaigns, which provide a particularly large number of recipients for one activity. This is beneficial from the financial point of view. The educational cooperation of the administration of landscape parks and forest districts of the State Forests may serve the common purpose of nature conservation, as it allows to increase the ecological awareness of tourists and local residents, as well as to organize tourist and recreational traffic.

AB  - Government's role in promoting the country's economy remains a relevant issue both in academics and politicians debates. Not only for individual countries but also for the European Union as a whole the promotion of high value-added activities, in particular in lower development small open economies which hardly recover from external economic shocks and experience significant social problems due to high unemployment level remains a relevant issue. The country's competitiveness and level of development, as well as the country's economy growth, depend on high value-added investment growth, and both private and public investments play a significant role in economy of each country. Government's role, in particular through the fiscal policy, in the promotion of these activities is crucial. The prevailing view in the scientific literature is that in developed countries public investment crowds out private investment, while in developing - crowds in, but it is not clear under what conditions these effects occur because the countries are very different. Also the effect of the taxes revenues and the government expenditure indicators on private investment is unclear because the effect of these variables on private investment has not been studied comprehensively. So the aim of the research is to evaluate the relationship between fiscal policy indicators, such as the government revenues from taxes and the government expenditure, and private investment comprehensively including indicators of macroeconomic environment in the Baltic States, by applying correlation and regression analysis.
   The conducted research revealed the existence of strong direct relationship between the fiscal policy indicators and private investment in the Baltic States, showing the importance of fiscal policy to private investment. During the analysis of detailed tax and expenditure indicators it has been established that the strongest relationship exists between the current taxes on income, wealth, etc and public investment with private investment. The current taxes on income, wealth, etc indicator explains about 86 percent of the private investment fluctuations and the gross fixed capital formation by public sector indicator explains about 80 percent of the private investment fluctuations in the Baltic States, whereas the effect of these indicators on private investment is analyzed separately, while macroeconomic indicators of a country explain only about 8-13 percent of the private investment fluctuations.

AB  - Ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) commonly record short-duration events (SDEs) that could be described by all of these characteristics: (i) duration <1 s, (ii) one single-wave train with no identified P nor S wave arrivals, and (iii) a dominant frequency usually between 4 and 30 Hz. In many areas, SDEs have been associated with gas- or fluid-related processes near cold seeps or hydrothermal vents, although fish bumps, instrumental, or current-generated noise have been proposed as possible sources. In order to address some remaining issues, this study presents results from in situ and laboratory experiments combined with observations from two contrasting areas, the Sea of Marmara (Turkey) and the Chilean subduction zone. The in situ experiment was conducted at the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water column Observatory-Molene submarine observatory (near Brest, France) and consisted in continuously monitoring two OBSs with a camera. The images revealed that no fish regularly bumped into the instruments. Laboratory experiments aimed at reproducing SDEs' waveforms by injecting air or water in a tank filled by sand and seawater and monitored with an OBS. Injecting air in the sediments produced waveforms very similar to the observed SDEs, while injecting air in the water column did not, constraining the source of SDEs in the seafloor sediments. Finally, the systematic analysis of two real data sets revealed that it is possible to discriminate gas-related SDEs from biological or sea state-related noise from simple source parameters, such as the temporal mode of occurrence, the back azimuth, and the dominant frequency.
   Plain Language Summary Ocean-bottom seismometers are instruments deployed on the ocean floor to study earthquakes and other sources of noise. They can record large teleseismic earthquakes, like all seismometers, and more specifically smaller submarine earthquakes. However, they also record noise generated by volcanoes, anthropogenic, or biological activity (whale calls). In particular, short events, lasting less than a second, have been reported worldwide with similar characteristics but their origin is still debated. They have been interpreted as fish hitting the instrument, signals generated by hydrothermal activity or by gas expelled out of the sediments. Here, we continuously monitored ocean-bottom seismometers with a camera and show that no fish accidentally stroke the instruments. Then, during laboratory experiments we demonstrate that gas expelled out of the marine sediments into the water can produce short signals very similar to those recorded by the seismometers in real conditions. Finally, we analyzed data from two experiments, one in the Sea of Marmara and the other offshore Chile. We show that short events are generated by gas expelled into the water. This study thus demonstrates the use of marine seismometers to monitor processes related to gas in the sea, which has direct impacts for better quantifying natural risks.

AB  - One of the directions of reforming the system of deposit insurance in the world is risk-oriented approach, which means that the degree of involvement in the system is determined by the degree of exposure of the participant's operations to risk. Correct estimation of the degree of risk of banking operations requires a well-grounded approach to the study of indicators-criteria that should be clear, understandable, and objective. The subject of research is the performance of the deposit guarantee system in Ukraine. Therefore, the present research aims to solve applied problems of establishing the content of qualitative indicators of banking operations that arise in their application for the sake of determining the degree of risk in the operations of the participant of the Deposit Guarantee Fund in the estimation of the amount of recurring charges.
   Methodology. Systemic method was applied to establish the content and assign qualitative indicators of bank performance for establishing their actual content in accordance with the regulation. On this basis, using a formal logical method, definitions of legal notions were formulated with due account of the financial and economic meaning as well as the established goal of legal regulation. Formal dogmatic approach allowed to make an analysis of the regulatory and legal framework of the state, to identify functional capacity of the system of protection of the rights and interests of bank depositors, their technical and legal excellence. Also, a number of other general scientific methods of research were applied, in particular: analysis (to study systemic application of the notions), historical legal (to study the establishment, change and development of the deposit guarantee system), comparative legal (to study the legislation determining specific principles of the functioning of the deposit guarantee system of natural persons in foreign states) etc. As the result, there has been established the essence of the current qualitative indicators used in the determination of the degree of risk of banking operations in Ukraine as far as application of the means of influence for violation of banking legislation by the National Bank of Ukraine to participating banks over the reporting period, as well as administrative and economic sanctions applied for violation of legislative requirements related to the deposit guarantee system of natural persons are concerned. Also, proposals have been developed concerning the procedure of their application for the sake of increasing the opportunities for ensuring risk-oriented approach.

AB  - The desire to document and understand the cumulative implications of oil sands (OS) development in the ambient environment of northeastern Alberta has motivated increased investment and release of information in the past decade. Here, we summarize the knowledge presented in the theme-based review papers in this special series, including air, surface water, terrestrial biology, and Indigenous community-based monitoring in order to (1) consolidate knowledge gained to date, (2) highlight key commonalities and gaps, and (3) leverage this knowledge to assess the state of integration in environmental monitoring efforts in the OS region and suggest next steps. Among air, water, and land studies, the individual reviews identified a clear focus on describing stressors, including primarily (1) contaminant emission, transport, transformation, deposition, and exposure, and (2) landscape disturbance. These emphases are generally partitioned by theme; air and water studies focus heavily on chemical stressors, whereas terrestrial monitoring focuses on biological change and landscape disturbance. Causal attribution is often stated as a high priority objective across all themes. However, studies often rely on spatial proximity to attribute cause to industrial activity, leaving causal attribution potentially confounded by spatial covariance of both OS- and non-OS-related stressors in the region, and by the complexity of interacting pathways between sources of environmental change and ecological receptors. Geospatial and modeling approaches are common across themes and may represent clear integration opportunities, particularly to help inform investigation-of-cause, but are not a replacement for robust field monitoring designs. Cumulative effects assessment remains a common focus of regional monitoring, but is limited in the peer-reviewed literature, potentially reflecting a lack of integration among monitoring efforts beyond narrow integrated interpretations of results. Addressing this requires greater emphasis on a priori integrated data collection and integrated analyses focused on the main residual exposure pathways, such as atmospheric deposition.

AB  - We analyzed diatom and water chemistry data collected by The Academy of Natural Sciences from 47 rivers throughout the eastern United States to address several ecological questions. How does the composition of diatom assemblages vary over large regional scales? What are the most important environmental factors affecting assemblage composition and how does their influence vary among regions and with spatial scale? How do distributions and autecological characteristics of individual taxa vary spatially? What are the implications of answers to these questions for use of diatoms as water quality indicators? Data for 186 samples at 116 sites were collected from 1951 to 1991 on moderate- to large-sized rivers ranging from Maine to Texas as part of Academy monitoring and survey programs, most initiated and implemented by Dr. Ruth Patrick. Several sites were highly impaired by point and non-point source pollution. Diatom assemblages grouped into four main categories, based on multivariate analyses. Group membership correlated equally well with intermediate-scale geographic regions and water chemistry: (1) Northeastern US rivers with lower alkalinity and hardness, and pH 6.5-7.8; (2) Primarily dilute coastal plain rivers in the southeastern United States with the lowest average pH (5.5-7.3) of all sites and some with high DOC; (3) Rivers within and west of the Appalachian Mountains, generally having higher pH (> 7.5) than those in other regions, but with relatively low chloride concentrations; and (4) Gulf Coast rivers with the highest chloride (> 100 mg l(-1)), hardness (> 250 mg l(-1)), and pH of rivers in all the groups. Hardness, pH, alkalinity, and Cl explained most of the variation among diatom assemblages, based on ordination analysis. Factors related to water quality problems, such as BOD, P, NH4, and turbidity explained much less variability at the eastern US scale, but were more important in the four intermediate-scale regions. Diatom taxa abundance-weighted mean values for water chemistry characteristics varied among the four intermediate-scale regions, often greatly, and in proportion to the average measured values for each region. Design of calibration data sets for development of water quality indicators should account for spatial scale in relation to species dispersal, regional geochemistry and habitat types, and human-influenced water chemistry characteristics.

AB  - Thermochemical water-splitting cycles have the potential of producing large-scale and cost-effective sustainable hydrogen in an environmentally benign manner. Limited exergoenvironmental assessments have been reported in the literature which generally considers thermochemical hydrogen production and specifically the copper-chlorine (Cu-Cl) cycle in thid regard. Thus, the present investigation aims at assessing the four-step integrated Cu-Cl thermochemical cycle set-up located at the Ontario Tech University thereby contributing to the environmental impact assessment of thermochemical hydrogen production. In this study, the exergy analysis of the cycle is first performed by thermodynamically modeling and simulating the cycle in Aspen-plus. The fundamental principles of the exergoenvironmental analysis, analogous to the specific exergy costing (SPECO) methodology of the exergoeconomic evaluation, are applied to the cycle and the balanced environmental impact equations for all cycle components are developed. Based on the balanced environmental impact equations, the environmental impact rate, and the specific environmental impact at each state point is evaluated. The environmental impact levels for all the major cycle components are also obtained. The exergoenvironmental factor, the relative difference of the specific environmental impacts, and the environmental impact rate of exergy destruction for various cycle components are in this regard evaluated. Furthermore, the influence of various parameters on the cumulative and component-related rate of environmental impact as well as the exergoenvironmental factor is analyzed by conducting a detailed sensitivity analysis. According to the obtained results, the rate of environmental impact corresponding to exergy destruction dominates the component-related rate of environmental impact and thus the potential reduction in the cumulative environmental impact for various components could be achieved by improving their exergy efficiencies. The hydrolysis step accounts for 60% of the component-related environmental impact while the thermolysis step accounts for the highest environmental impact of exergy destruction ranging between 41 and 42%. The percentage difference between fossil fuel-based and renewable electricity in terms of the global warming potential ranges between 80% and 98% with the highest difference for wind and nuclearbased electricity.

Statistical collections, results of the All-Union Census of the USSR in 1939, unpublished reports, summaries and other forms of statistical reports of the central (Russian State Archive of Economics, State Archive of the Russian Federation) and regional archives (Central State Archive of the Kirov Region, State Archive of the Republic of Mari Al, State Historical Archive of the Republic of Chuvashia) allowed to analyze the main characteristics of the birth rate and present demographic indicators.
   According to the concept of "fertility" and the selected criteria for assessing its level, researchers calculated demographic coefficients and analyzed the current demographic situation. Chernysheva N.V., Svintsova M.N. point out that structural (purely demographic) and non-structural factors influenced fertility rate. A sharp drop in the birth rate in the Volga-Vyatka region had been taking place since April 1942. The lowest point was in 1943 (9.8 parts per thousand in the Kirov region). The amount of multiple births did not significantly decrease. The gender ratio of born children remained (more boys were born than girls), but infant mortality among boys was higher. The war influenced the seasonality of births, leveling this indicator in all autonomous republics and regions of the Volga-Vyatka region since 1943. Changes in the birth rate were also observed according to the type of settlement: a sharp decline in urban areas along with rapid recovery processes in 1944-1945. The demographic situation was aggravated by a high level of infant mortality (in 1942 every third to fourth infant died).
   In such conditions, it was important to prevent a further drop in the birth rate and to help pregnant women, mothers and children. Analyzing measures of demographic and social policy, researchers state their unsystematic nature. Only since 1944 we can talk about a set of long time measures (rights of women and mothers in a situation of social risk (pregnant women, single mothers, mothers with many children), pay and benefits). Using the calculation method of B.Ts. Urlanis, the authors determined that the birth deficit was 7019000 people in the republics and regions of the Volga-Vyatka region during the Great Patriotic War.

AB  - The El Nino of 1997-98 was one of the strongest warming events of the past century: among many other effects, it impacted phytoplankton along the Peruvian coast by changing species composition and reducing biomass. While responses of the main fish resources to this natural perturbation are relatively well known, understanding the ecosystem response as a whole requires an ecotrophic multispecies approach. In this work, we construct trophic models of the Northern Humboldt Current Ecosystem (NHCE) and compare the La Nina (LN) years in 1995-96 with the El Nino (EN) years in 1997-98. The model area extends from 4 degrees S-16 degrees S and to 60 nm from the coast. The model consists of 32 functional groups of organisms and differs from previous trophic models of the Peruvian system through: (i) division of plankton into size classes to account for EN-associated changes and feeding preferences of small pelagic fish, (ii) increased division of demersal groups and separation of life history stages of hake, (iii) inclusion of mesopelagic fish, and (iv) incorporation of the jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas), which became abundant following EN. Results show that EN reduced the size and organization of energy flows of the NHCE, but the overall functioning (proportion of energy flows used for respiration, consumption by predators, detritus and export) of the ecosystem was maintained. The reduction of diatom biomass during EN forced omnivorous planktivorous fish to switch to a more zooplankton-dominated diet, raising their trophic level. Consequently, in the EN model the trophic level increased for several predatory groups (mackerel, other large pelagics, sea birds, pinnipeds) and for fishery catch. A high modeled biomass of macrozooplankton was needed to balance the consumption by planktivores, especially during EN condition when observed diatoms biomass diminished dramatically. Despite overall lower planktivorous fish catches, the higher primary production required-to-catch ratio implied a stronger ecological impact of the fishery and stresses the need for precautionary management of fisheries during and after EN. During EN energetic indicators such as the lower primary production/total biomass ratio suggest a more energetically efficient ecosystem, while reduced network indicators such as the cycling index and relative ascendency indicate of a less organized state of the ecosystem. Compared to previous trophic models of the NHCE we observed: (i) a shrinking of ecosystem size in term of energy flows, (ii) slight changes in overall functioning (proportion of energy flows used for respiration, consumption by predators and detritus), and (iii) the use of alternate pathways leading to a higher ecological impact of the fishery for planktivorous fish.

AB  - Natural perchlorate (ClO4) is of increasing interest due to its wide-spread occurrence on Earth and Mars, yet little information exists on the relative abundance of ClO4- compared to other major anions, its stability, or long-term variations in production that may impact the observed distributions. Our objectives were to evaluate the occurrence and fate of ClO4- in groundwater and soils/caliche in arid and semi-arid environments (southwestern United States, southern Africa, United Arab Emirates, China, Antarctica, and Chile) and the relationship of ClO4 to the more well-studied atmospherically deposited anions NO3- and Cl- as a means to understand the prevalent processes that affect the accumulation of these species over various time scales. ClO4- is globally distributed in soil and groundwater in arid and semi-arid regions on Earth at concentrations ranging from 10(-1) to 10(6) mu g/kg. Generally, the ClO4- concentration in these regions increases with aridity index, but also depends on the duration of arid conditions. In many arid and semi-arid areas, NO3- and ClO4- co-occur at molar ratios (NO3-/ClO4-) that vary between similar to 10(4) and 10(5). We hypothesize that atmospheric deposition ratios are largely preserved in hyper-arid areas that support little or no biological activity (e.g. plants or bacteria), but can be altered in areas with more active biological processes including N-2 fixation, N mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and microbial ClO4- reduction, as indicated in part by NO3- isotope data. In contrast, much larger ranges of Cl-/ClO4- and Cl-/NO3- ratios indicate Cl- varies independently from both ClO4- and NO3-. The general lack of correlation between Cl- and ClO4- or NO3- implies that Cl- is not a good indicator of co-deposition and should be used with care when interpreting oxyanion cycling in arid systems. The Atacama Desert appears to be unique compared to all other terrestrial locations having a NO3-/ClO4- molar ratio similar to 10(3). The relative enrichment in ClO4- compared to Cl- or NO3- and unique isotopic composition of Atacama ClO4- may reflect either additional in-situ production mechanism(s) or higher relative atmospheric production rates in that specific region or in the geological past. Elevated concentrations of ClO4- reported on the surface of Mars, and its enrichment with respect to Cl- and NO3-, could reveal important clues regarding the climatic, hydrologic, and potentially biologic evolution of that planet. Given the highly conserved ratio of NO3-/ClO4- in non-biologically active areas on Earth, it may be possible to use alterations of this ratio as a biomarker on Mars and for interpreting major anion cycles and processes on both Mars and Earth, particularly with respect to the less-conserved NO3- pool terrestrially.

AB  - The Earth's remaining tracts of wildlands are being altered by increased human pressure and climate change. Yet, there is no systematic approach for quantifying change in the ecological condition of wildland ecosystems. This paper applies a Wildland Health Index (WHI) to evaluate trends in ecological vital signs in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Components of the WHI include criteria for judging ecosystem health, vital signs consistent with these criteria, monitoring at spatial scales relevant to the ecosystem, evaluating trends in condition, and communicating with decision makers. The GYE, while large, intact, and with substantial management capacity, is undergoing increasing human pressure and climate change. Thus, assessment of trends in ecological health is needed to prioritize management. We synthesized current knowledge to evaluate trends in stressors and vital signs of ecosystem function, composition, and structure for 1970 to present and forecasted to 2100. Results were summarized in a WHI Scorecard to illustrate trends in the higher level vital signs of interest to policy makers. We found that human population has doubled, and housing density has tripled in the GYE since 1970 and both are projected to double again by 2050. Human development is now estimated to cover 31% of the GYE. Temperature has warmed 0.8 degrees C since 1950 and is projected to increase 2.5-5.3 degrees C by 2100. These changes in land use and climate have reduced snowpack and stream flows, increased stream temperatures, favored pest outbreaks and forest die-off, fragmented habitat types, expanded invasive species, and reduced native fish populations. Large mammal populations, in contrast, have been increasing in numbers and expanding in range. These trends differ among land allocation types. The WHI Scorecard rated 6 of 9 vital signs as relatively stable or improving in national parks and designated wilderness. On private lands, in contrast, five vital signs were rated as deteriorating. Confidence in our evaluation is not high because of lack of monitoring across the full GYE. While the National Park Service has a rigorous monitoring program, fewer vital signs are tracked on other federal lands and still fewer on private lands. Thus, trends in ecological condition are not evaluated across the entire GYE nor widely reported in the media. We recommend that the WHI approach be systematically applied across the GYE and other large wildland ecosystems in the United States to better inform management to sustain these wildlands.

AB  - Over the last few decades, the concentration of cadmium (Cd) in the environment has increased considerably in many countries due to anthropogenic activities. Cd is one of the most toxic pollutants in the environment and affects many metabolic processes in plants. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the response of the production, nutritional, and enzymatic antioxidant system of two tomato genotypes (Calabash Rouge and CNPH 0082) grown in tropical soils that were treated with doses of Cd. Soil samples were collected from the layer of earth at a depth of 0-0.2 m in areas subjected to a minimum of human disturbance. The concentrations of Cd applied to the soil samples were 0, 1, 2, and 4 times (0, 3, 6, and 12 mg kg(-1) of Cd) the agricultural intervention value adopted by current environmental legislation in the state of Sao Paulo. Brazil. Analysis of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, guaiacol peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase activities, formation of stress indicator compound (malondialdehyde MDA and hydrogen peroxide), parameters of production dry mass of the shoot and root system (here in after "shoots" and "roots"), as well as nutrition, and both the bioavailable and total levels of this metal in the soil were performed. When the bioavailable content and total levels of Cd in the soil increased as a result of this metal doses applied, the biomass of both shoots and roots decreased in both genotypes (with the exception of the CNPH 0082 grown in clay soil) and displayed lower SPAD (relative chlorophyll index) values when exposed to contaminated environments with Cd concentrations. Cadmium treatment resulted in nutritional imbalances, mainly in terms of N, P, and Mn metabolism. Plants subjected to an elevated available content of metal in the soil exhibited increases in content of MDA and hydrogen peroxide and increased activity of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and guaiacol peroxidase in plant tissues when grown in both clay soil and sandy soil. Cadmium was phytotoxic to the plants causing a nutritional imbalance, especially on the metabolisms of N, P, and Mn. An oxidative stress condition was established in response to the Cd treatments applied, which led to changes in peroxidase activity.

AB  - The analysis of the economic efficiency of agriculture has been the subject of numerous studies. An economically efficient agricultural sector is not always environmentally efficient. Agriculture is a large emitter of greenhouse gases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that food production and agriculture are responsible for 21-37% of total global CO2 emissions. Due to the comprehensive assessment of the agricultural efficiency, it is worthwhile to apply to its measurement an integrated approach based on economic, energy and environmental aspects. These aspects were the main reasons for undertaking this research. The purpose of the study was to determine the economic, energy and environmental efficiency of agriculture in the EU Member States in 2019. The environmental analyses relate to the period 1990-2019. A total of 26 member states of the European Union (excluding Malta and Luxembourg) were selected for research. The sources of materials were Eurostat and the European Environmental Agency. This study was based on the Data Envelopment Analysis method, and used the DEA model focused on minimizing inputs. The research also adopts energy productivity and greenhouse gas emission efficiency indicators. The DEA model features the following variables: one effect (value of agricultural production) and four inputs (land, labour, use of fertilizers and use of energy). It was found that seven out of the 26 studied EU countries have efficient agriculture. The efficient agriculture group included The Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Cyprus, the United Kingdom, Italy and Ireland. Based on the DEA method, benchmarks have been defined for countries with inefficient agriculture. On the basis of these benchmarks for inefficient agricultural sectors, it was possible to determine how they could improve efficiency to achieve the same results with fewer inputs. This issue is particularly important in the context of sustainable agricultural development. In the next stage of the research, the analysis of economic and energy efficiency was combined with the analysis of GHG emission efficiency in agriculture. Four groups of countries have been distinguished: eco-efficiency leaders, eco-efficiency followers, environmental slackers, eco-efficiency laggards. The leaders of the classification were The Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Portugal.

AB  - A plan for Post Market Environmental Monitoring (PMEM) of genetically modified (GM) plants is mandatory in all applications for deliberate release submitted under EU Directive 2001/18/EC and EU Regulation 1829/2003. PMEM is composed of case-specific monitoring and general surveillance of GM plants. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is responsible for assessing the scientific quality of PMEM plans submitted with each application. In a scientific opinion, the EFSA GMO Panel presented specific guidance for applicants for developing PMEM plans. In addition the EFSA GMO Panel explained the scientific rationale for this guidance and makes a number of recommendations for the management and conduct of PMEM by both applicants and risk managers. Until the end of March 2007, the EFSA GMO Panel gave opinions on 11 PMEM plans submitted under EU Directive 2001/18/EC and another 11 plans submitted within applications under EU Regulation 1829/2003. Currently 27 applications for GM plants are still in the evaluation process and the EFSA GMO Panel sent 26 questions to the applicants for clarification and additional information during the evaluation process. Sixteen of these questions were related to General Surveillance (e.g. general structure, farm & operator questionnaires, integrations of identity preservation systems, use of existing surveillance systems, feral plant surveillance). Nine questions requested clarification on the environmental risk assessment, which might effect whether case-specific monitoring is needed. In one case (an application for cultivation of a GM crop), the GMO Panel recommended case-specific monitoring. We explain in more detail how the environmental risk assessment of two Bt maize dossiers (maize Bt11 and 1507) were considered by the GMO Panel in the evaluation of the PMEM plan and the consequences for the environmental monitoring plan. As stated in the EFSA opinion on post-market environmental monitoring, the general surveillance plans shall, when possible, make use of existing monitoring systems in addition to more focused monitoring systems. However, the use of these national monitoring programmes is outside of the management and control of an individual applicant and thus it cannot be the task of an applicant alone to use, modify or improve existing surveillance systems. The availability of biodiversity monitoring programmes in the EU Member States should be evaluated by applicants in close liaison with risk managers.

AB  - It has become vital to effectively characterize the self-similar and regular patterns in time series marked by short-term and long-term memory in various fields in the ever-changing and complex global landscape. Within this framework, attempting to find solutions with adaptive mathematical models emerges as a major endeavor in economics whose complex systems and structures are generally volatile, vulnerable and vague. Thus, analysis of the dynamics of occurrence of time section accurately, efficiently and timely is at the forefront to perform forecasting of volatile states of an economic environment which is a complex system in itself since it includes interrelated elements interacting with one another. To manage data selection effectively and attain robust prediction, characterizing complexity and self-similarity is critical in financial decision-making. Our study aims to obtain analyzes based on two main approaches proposed related to seven recognized indexes belonging to prominent countries (DJI, FCHI, GDAXI, GSPC, GSTPE, N225 and Bitcoin index). The first approach includes the employment of Hurst exponent (HE) as calculated by Rescaled Range (R/S) fractal analysis and Wavelet Entropy (WE) in order to enhance the prediction accuracy in the long-term trend in the financial markets. The second approach includes Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms application Feed forward back propagation (FFBP), Cascade Forward Back Propagation (CFBP) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm for forecasting purposes. The following steps have been administered for the two aforementioned approaches: (i) HE and WE were applied. Consequently, new indicators were calculated for each index. By obtaining the indicators, the new dataset was formed and normalized by min-max normalization method' (ii) to form the forecasting model, ANN algorithms were applied on the datasets. Based on the experimental results, it has been demonstrated that the new dataset comprised of the HE and WE indicators had a critical and determining direction with a more accurate level of forecasting modeling by the ANN algorithms. Consequently, the proposed novel method with multifarious methodology illustrates a new frontier, which could be employed in the broad field of various applied sciences to analyze pressing real-world problems and propose optimal solutions for critical decision-making processes in nonlinear, complex and dynamic environments.

AB  - To implement ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), there is a need to comprehensively examine fundamental components of fisheries ecosystems and ascertain the characteristics and strategies facilitating this more systematic approach. Coupled natural and human factors, inherent biological productivities, and systematic governance measures all influence living marine resource (LMR) and socioeconomic status within a given socio-ecological system (SES). Determining the relative prominence of these factors remains a challenge. Examining these facets to determine how much EBFM and wise LMR management occurs is timely and warranted given the many issues facing marine fisheries ecosystems. Here we characterize major United States (U.S.) marine fishery ecosystems by examining these facets and compiling a consistent, multidisciplinary view of these coupled SESs using commonly available, integrated data for each ecosystem. We then examine if major patterns and lessons emerge when comparing across SESs. This work also seeks to elucidate what are the determinants of successful LMR management. Although U.S.-centric, the breadth of the ecosystems explored here are likely globally applicable. Overall, we observed that inherent biological productivity was a major driver determining the level of fisheries biomass, landings, and LMR economic value for a given region, but that human interventions can offset basal production. We observed that good governance could overcome certain ecosystem limitations, and vice versa, especially as tradeoffs within regions have intensified over time. We also found that all U.S. regions are performing well in terms of certain aspects of LMR management, with unique successes and challenges observed in all regions. Although attributes of marine fisheries ecosystems differ among regions, there are commonalities that can be applied and transferred across them. These include having: clear stock status identified; relatively stable but attentive management interventions; clear tracking of broader ecosystem considerations; landings to biomass exploitation rates at typically <0.1; areal landings at typically <1 t km(2) year(-1); ratios of landings relative to primary production at typically <0.001; and explicit consideration of socio-economic factors directly in management. Integrated, cross-disciplinary perspectives and systematic comparative syntheses such as this one offer insight in determining regionally-specific and overarching approaches for successful LMR management.

AB  - A literature review is undertaken to understand how well existing studies of the environmental impacts of hybrid and electric vehicles (EV) address the full life cycle of these technologies. Results of studies are synthesized to compare the global warming potential (GWP) of different EV and internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) options. Other impacts are compared; however, data availability limits the extent to which this could be accomplished.
   We define what should be included in a complete, state-of-the-art environmental assessment of hybrid and electric vehicles considering components and life cycle stages, emission categories, impact categories, and resource use and compare the content of 51 environmental assessments of hybrid and electric vehicles to our definition. Impact assessment results associated with full life cycle inventories (LCI) are compared for GWP as well as emissions of other pollutants. GWP results by life cycle stage and key parameters are extracted and used to perform a meta-analysis quantifying the impacts of vehicle options.
   Few studies provide a full LCI for EVs together with assessment of multiple impacts. Research has focused on well to wheel studies comparing fossil fuel and electricity use as the use phase has been seen to dominate the life cycle of vehicles. Only very recently have studies begun to better address production impacts. Apart from batteries, very few studies provide transparent LCIs of other key EV drivetrain components. Estimates of EV energy use in the literature span a wide range, 0.10-0.24 kWh/km. Similarly, battery and vehicle lifetime plays an important role in results, yet lifetime assumptions range between 150,000-300,000 km. CO2 and GWP are the most frequently reported results. Compiled results suggest the GWP of EVs powered by coal electricity falls between small and large conventional vehicles while EVs powered by natural gas or low-carbon energy sources perform better than the most efficient ICEVs. EV results in regions dependant on coal electricity demonstrated a trend toward increased SO (x) emissions compared to fuel use by ICEVs.
   Moving forward research should focus on providing consensus around a transparent inventory for production of electric vehicles, appropriate electricity grid mix assumptions, the implications of EV adoption on the existing grid, and means of comparing vehicle on the basis of common driving and charging patterns. Although EVs appear to demonstrate decreases in GWP compared to conventional ICEVs, high efficiency ICEVs and grid-independent hybrid electric vehicles perform better than EVs using coal-fired electricity.

AB  - Empirical measures of animal behavior and space use within the captive environment can provide critical information about animals' requirements, preferences and internal states. The trend toward naturalistic environments has shown promise in terms of behavioral benefits for animals such as great apes, and there have been several studies of the effects of complex environments on captive apes. However, few recent investigations have objectively compared environmental preferences between two distinct enclosures. In this study, we assessed how ape space use varied within and across two very different environments: an indoor, hardscape enclosure and an indoor/outdoor, naturalistic enclosure. Within-facility tests were conducted by comparing data from behavioral observations of the apes' position in the enclosures to measurements of the space and the availability of individual environmental elements. Between-facility comparisons utilized electivity index calculations to assess both the degree of use for specific features and the degree to which these selections strengthened or weakened in the new facility. Both gorillas and chimpanzees showed significant structural preferences in the older, hardscape environment: positioning themselves by mesh barriers (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) and corners (P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) more than would be expected by random spatial utilization, and avoiding open spaces (chimpanzees: P = 0.005; gorillas: P < 0.001) not adjacent to any physical structure. A new, naturalistic enclosure was constructed using preference data from the previous facility. In the new facility, both species of ape substantially altered the way in which they chose to position themselves in the enclosure. Chimpanzees used most of the environmental elements at rates more similar to the proportions they were available. While gorilla's preference corners was maintained in the new facility, preferences for doorways and mesh barriers disappeared. Comparing electivity indices facilitated an empirical comparison of space use preferences. Chimpanzees showed significant differences in how they used structural elements (P = 0.021), mesh barriers (P = 0.009) and corners (P = 0.016) in the new facility. Gorillas' environmental selections were similarly altered in the new facility, as selections of areas adjacent to doorways (P = 0.003). glass barriers (P = 0.005), structural elements (P < 0.001), and mesh barriers (P = 0.012) were all significantly affected by the transfer. This approach is useful for understanding how captive animals utilize their enclosures and we advocate that electivity indices can be added to a growing list of tools to assess the effect of captive environments on animal welfare.

AB  - Quantifying the natural flow regime is essential for management of water resources and conservation of aquatic ecosystems. Understanding the degree to which anthropogenic activities have altered flows is critical for developing effective conservation strategies. Assessing flow alteration requires estimates of flows expected in the absence of human influence and under current land use and water management. There are several techniques to predict flows in streams and rivers; however, none have been applied to make predictions of natural flow conditions over large regions and time periods. We utilised machine learning statistical models to predict natural monthly flows (natural streamflows without the influence of water management or anthropogenic land use) in California from 1950 to 2015, using time-dependent and fixed watershed variables from reference stream gages. These models were then used to make estimates of mean, maximum and minimum monthly flows in all streams in the state. We compared observed flows measured at 540 stream gages across the state with expected natural flows at the same locations, to quantify the type, frequency and magnitude of flow alteration over the past 20years (1996-2015). A gage was considered altered if an observed flow metric (monthly mean, annual maximum, annual minimum) fell outside the 80% prediction interval of the modelled flow estimate. We found that 95% of the 540 stream gages in California had at least 1month of altered flows over the past 20years, and 11% of gages were frequently altered (over two-thirds of the months recorded had evidence of altered flows). The type of alteration varied across the state with flows being either depleted, inflated or a mix of both at different times of the year. Most altered gages (68%) exhibited both depletion and inflation in monthly flows over the time period. Inflation of monthly mean flows was most prevalent during the summer months, while depletion of monthly flows was evident throughout the year. Type, frequency and magnitude of flow alteration varied by region. Flow depletion was present at >80% of gages in the North Coast and Central Coast, flow inflation was measured at >80% of gages in the South Coast and San Francisco Bay and both depletion and inflation were evident at >80% of gages in the Sacramento River and San Joaquin and Tulare regions. Annual maximum flows were consistently depleted and annual minimum flows were commonly inflated in the Sierra Nevada and Central Valley (Sacramento River and San Joaquin and Tulare regions). This is the first study to comprehensively assess flow alteration at stream gages across California. Understanding the patterns and degree of alteration can aid in prioritising streams for environmental flow assessment and developing conservation strategies for native freshwater biota.

AB  - High variability among individuals is often encountered when hemocyte characteristics are measured in bivalves. Such variability is suspected to result partly from genetic factors. In this study, hemocyte characteristics of six families of Crassostrea gigas were compared by flow cytometry at one sampling date in October 2001. These families were obtained from a nested, half-sibling cross design, and reared from July to October 2001 at three sites distributed along the French Atlantic coast from north to south: Baie des Veys (Normandy), Riviere d'Auray (Brittany) and Ronce (Marennes-oleron Basin, Poitou Charentes).
   Among the 15 measured hemocyte characteristics, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of untreated hemocytes (maintained in filtered sterile seawater) and treated hemocytes (zymosan at 20 particles per hemocyte, and with vibrio sp. S322 at 50 bacteria per hemocyte) was the most notable differences between families. This supports the existence of a genetic basis, at least partly, for the hemocyte characteristics of oysters, and especially for ROS production.
   Among the six families analyzed, three have shown high survival during summer (named as "resistant", mean mortality 5.2%) and three experienced high mortality during summer (named as "susceptible", 30.6% mean mortality). Families showing high or low survival to summer mortality had similar hemocyte characteristics, regardless of the environmental conditions or reproductive state. Resistant families were observed to have higher total hemocyte counts and lower production of ROS than susceptible families. Moreover, ROS production of hemocytes from susceptible families was diminished significantly more by pathogenic vibrio than that of resistant families. However, this study demonstrates also that rearing site strongly affected the hemocyte characteristics of all families of oysters, most notably hemocyte concentration and morphology (size and granularity), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and susceptibility to the cytotoxic activity of the pathogenic vibrio sp. S322 (50 bacteria/ hemocyte). Food availability and reproductive state are the most probable explanations for the site differences observed. Finally, it appeared difficult to link oyster survival during summer mortality to hemocyte profiles evaluated at one sampling date; other relevant indicators would probably help explaining oyster survival during summer mortality events.

AB  - Problem formulation. The global climate warming influences the balance of water reservoirs by lower precipitation, higher evaporation, erosion of soils and other changes. On the territory of Ukraine, the periods without rains, low snow level, warm winters and dry summers, strong winds and dust storms became frequent during the last decades. This led to a change in many hydrological parameters in comparison with the hydrological regimes usual in temperate climates. Therefore, the determination of the ecological assessment of the state of water reservoirs in the conditions of the urban drainage basin in the rainless period is an insufficiently studied and urgent issue.
   The aim of the article is estimation of quality of the river water in the system of rivers Lopan-Kharkov-Udy on the urban landscale of Kgarkov region.
   Materials and methods. Field sampling of water and bottom sediments to provide an environmental assessment of the water reservoir; comparison of the results obtained with similar ones obtained for rainy periods and periods of snow melting in different hydrological regimes, and statistical analysis of the measured data.
   Results. Analysis of the open source data revealed that Kharkov region is among the top three in terms of drinking and technical water needs for various purposes. The region has a maximum possible drought risk index (0.8-1) and high values of water stress indices (2-3) and coastal flood risk (2-3).
   Water samples taken from different sections of the Lopan and Udy rivers in different seasons showed that some of the parameters exceed the corresponding control values, especially in rainless periods, but in general water quality indices correspond to 1-2 quality classes (depending on the season) for the river Lopan and the 1st class of quality - for the river Udy. Numerical calculations on a mathematical model using the measurement data showed that global warming at 0.5-1 degrees C by 2030 will lead to a significant deterioration in water quality and its availability as the required amount of drinking and industrial water for the region.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Lake Skadar is the largest lake of the Balkan Peninsula, located along the Montenegro-Albanian border. The unique features of the lake and wide range of endemic, and rare or endangered plant and animal species, resulted in the classification of the Skadar as a wetland site of international significance. In spite of its importance, the lake is influenced by inflowing waters from the river Moraca and other regional rivers contaminated by the industry, Municipal and agricultural activities in the area. Therefore, the lake has been the Subject of various physical, chemical, biological and toxicological examinations. However, community-level analyses are most relevant to assess the effect of stressors on aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, bacteria] community structure among differently polluted sites of the lake was compared using a genetic fingerprinting technique.
   Methods. Water and sediment samples were collected from five differently polluted sampling sites on the Lake Skadar in spring and autumn of the same year. The bacterial community Structure in the samples was characterized and compared by temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE) analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes.
   Results and Discussion. The TTGE analysis resulted in man), distinguishable and reproducible band patterns, allowing a reliable comparison of bacterial communities among sampling sites. Results on the bacterial community structure revealed that three of the selected locations call be considered as sites that have not shown any pollution degradation determined by Our method, due to similar structure of a bacterial community in the sediment samples. Oil the other hand, significant shifts in the bacterial community structure in the mouth of the rivers Mora a and Plavnica were shown. Since the results coincide with some of the bioassays and chemical analysis performed previously, the changes in bacterial community structure are explained as an effect of antropogenic pollution oil the lake ecosystem by waters of the river Moraca and the stream Plavnica.
   Conclusion. The TTGE has proven to be an efficient and reliable method to monitor bacterial dynamics and community shifts in aquatic environments, especially in sediments. Within the variety of environmental quality assessments, the use of TTGE analyses from bacterial communities is strongly recommended, particularly as an initial investigation. However, in any conclusion on the state of the environment, the TTGE results should be combined to some other biological, chemical and hydrological data.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Since prokaryotes are a crucial group of organisms in the biosphere, the ecosystem function Studies are largely based oil bacterial communities. Therefore, bacterial community structure analysis should be a part of an integrated weight of evidence approach in pollution assessment. In case of Triad approach, consisting of chemical analyses, bioassays, and community studies in the field, the TTGE bacterial community structure analyses should be placed in the later Triad leg. In comparison to other community studies, based on various biotic indices, the TTGE bacterial community analysis has proven to be very sensitive, reliable and less time consuming.

AB  - Bacteria play a key role in freshwater biogeochemical cycling, but long-term trends in freshwater bacterial community composition and dynamics are not yet well characterized. We used a multiyear time series of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from eight bog lakes to census the freshwater bacterial community and observe annual and seasonal trends in abundance. The sites that we studied encompassed a range of water column mixing frequencies, which we hypothesized would be associated with trends in alpha and beta diversity. Each lake and layer contained a distinct bacterial community, with distinct levels of richness and indicator taxa that likely reflected the environmental conditions of each lake type sampled, including Actinobacteria in polymictic lakes (i.e., lakes with multiple mixing events per year), Methylophilales in dimictic lakes (lakes with two mixing events per year, usually in spring and fall), and "Candidatus Omnitrophica" in meromictic lakes (lakes with no recorded mixing events). The community present during each year at each site was also surprisingly unique. Despite unexpected interannual variability in community composition, we detected a core community of taxa found in all lakes and layers, including Actinobacteria tribe acI-B2 and Betaprotobacteria lineage PnecC. Although trends in abundance did not repeat annually, each freshwater lineage within the communities had a consistent lifestyle, defined by persistence, abundance, and variability. The results of our analysis emphasize the importance of long-term multisite observations, as analyzing only a single year of data or one lake would not have allowed us to describe the dynamics and composition of these freshwater bacterial communities to the extent presented here.
   IMPORTANCE Lakes are excellent systems for investigating bacterial community dynamics because they have clear boundaries and strong environmental gradients. The results of our research demonstrate that bacterial community composition varies by year, a finding which likely applies to other ecosystems and has implications for study design and interpretation. Understanding the drivers and controls of bacterial communities on long time scales would improve both our knowledge of fundamental properties of bacterial communities and our ability to predict community states. In this specific ecosystem, bog lakes play a disproportionately large role in global carbon cycling, and the information presented here may ultimately help refine carbon budgets for these lakes. Finally, all data and code in this study are publicly available. We hope that this will serve as a resource for anyone seeking to answer their own microbial ecology questions using a multiyear time series.

AB  - Purpose Due to its highly energy-intensive process, Bitcoin has attracted the global attention of climate research and media. At the time of this submission, behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining has gained significant traction; however, not a single environmental impact assessment has been conducted on this type of operation. This study seeks to fill the gap, applying the established Life Cycle Assessment methodology to estimate the environmental footprint of a single case study.
   Methods A life cycle assessment methodology of a natural gas power plant mining Bitcoin behind-the-meter in the state of New York following the ISO 14040 guidelines was applied. The functional unit (FU) is defined as the attributed generation capacity of 14 MW over the course of a regular full-calendar year in the attributional model. The FU is scaled to 22 MW and 104 MW in the predictive models to represent planned expansion. The TRACI 2.1 method was applied to characterize the environmental impact. The environmental impact categories considered in this study included global warming, acidification, smog formation, and particulate emissions.
   Results and discussion Located in New York State, Greenidge LLC, a natural gas power plant produces an estimated 88,440 metric tons of CO2-eq per year to mine Bitcoin behind-the-meter. Annual emissions would total 656,983 metric tons of CO2-eq if the plant devotes 100% of its generation to Bitcoin mining. The primary driver of greenhouse gas emissions is the generation of electricity itself, accounting for similar to 79% of the total emissions. At full capacity, annual emissions are comparable to the annual emissions of 140,000 passenger vehicles or the emissions resulting from the burning of 600 million lb of coal. Further, additional planned cases could produce an estimated 1.9 million tons tCO(2)-eq per annum.
   Conclusions Behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining makes the power plant a significant contributor to global warming at a time when New York State is attempting to radically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050 and to have 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The environmental impact of this business model is not limited to individual sites but is spread out over upstream impacts as well. In combination, we see that behind-the-meter Bitcoin mining not only goes against local climate initiatives but also poses a significant danger to national initiatives due to feasible scalability, caused by an availability of existing infrastructure and favorable financials.

AB  - Phytoplankton usually responds directly and fast to environmental fluctuations, making them useful indicators of lake ecosystem changes caused by various stressors. Here, we examined the phytoplankton community composition before, during, and after a simulated 1-month heat wave in a mesocosm facility in Silkeborg, Denmark. The experiment was conducted over three contrasting temperature scenarios (ambient (A0), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario (circa +3 degrees C, A2) and A2+ %50 (circa +4.5 degrees C, A2+)) crossed with two nutrient levels (low (LN) and high (HN)) with four replicates. The facility includes 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes, which at the time of our experiment had run without interruption for 11 years. The 1-month heat wave effect was simulated by increasing the temperature by 5 degrees C (1 July to 1 August) in A2 and A2+, while A0 was not additionally heated. Throughout the study, HN treatments were mostly dominated by Cyanobacteria, whereas LN treatments were richer in genera and mostly dominated by Chlorophyta. Linear mixed model analyses revealed that high nutrient conditions were the most important structuring factor, which, regardless of temperature treatments and heat waves, increased total phytoplankton, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cyanobacteria biomasses and decreased genus richness and the grazing pressure of zooplankton. The effect of temperature was, however, modest. The effect of warming on the phytoplankton community was not significant before the heat wave, yet during the heat wave it became significant, especially in LN-A2+, and negative interaction effects between nutrient and A2+ warming were recorded. These warming effects continued after the heat wave, as also evidenced by Co-inertia analyses. In contrast to the prevailing theory stating that more diverse ecosystems would be more stable, HN were less affected by the heat wave disturbance, most likely because the dominant phytoplankton group cyanobacteria is adapted to high nutrient conditions and also benefits from increased temperature. We did not find any significant change in phytoplankton size diversity, but size evenness decreased in HN as a result of an increase in the smallest and largest size classes simultaneously. We conclude that the phytoplankton community was most strongly affected by the nutrient level, but less sensitive to changes in both temperature treatments and the heat wave simulation in these systems, which have been adapted for a long time to different temperatures. Moreover, the temperature and heat wave effects were observed mostly in LN systems, indicating that the sensitivity of phytoplankton community structure to high temperatures is dependent on nutrient availability.

AB  - Aim: Birds are excellent indicators of the state of a healthy environment and form an integral component of agricultural ecosystem. Rapid agricultural intensification leads to uniform habitat system resulting in decline of farmland bird diversity throughout the world. Birds are intimately related to agricultural habitat for their needs such as food, shelter and breeding places. Keeping this in mind, it was planned to study the effect of zero tillage agriculture on avian diversity to generate baseline data.
   Methodology: Bird observations were recorded in zero till wheat fields and direct seeded paddy fields of Punjab Agricultural University (latitude 30 degrees 54'147 N and longitude of 75 degrees 47' 642 E and 244 m above mean sea level), Ludhiana from May 2014 to April 2015. Line Transect Method was used for the survey of different bird species. Relative abundance (%) was calculated as: (ni/N) x 100, where ni is the number of birds of ith species and N is the total number of birds all species.
   Results: Species recorded in zero till wheat and direct seeded paddy crop was 23 and 21 respectively. Seven omnivore and five grainivorous bird species were recorded as overlapping species in zero till and direct seeded paddy crops. Highest value of species richness was recorded at ripening stage of zero till wheat crop. Results of the present study indicated that zero till wheat and direct seeded paddy attracts more bird species as compared to intensively cultivated paddy.
   Interpretation: In the direct seeded paddy crop, species richness was highest both at seedling stage and reproductive stage., In zero Warming stubbles and chaff from the previous crop remained undisturbed on soil surface, and undisturbed soil provided spilled grains, weed seeds, insects and small mammals to birds to feed on, so greater number of species was evident. From the present study, it is summarized that species abundance and species diversity was more in zero tillage crop fields as compared to intensively cultivated fields, which signifies that zero till farming has potential for conservation of avian biodiversity in a more sustainable way, while, allowing the farmers to continue cropping in intensively cultivated agro-climatic zones.

AB  - Meeting the diverse sustainability targets of modern society has led to the development of national-level management frameworks meant to guide resource management actions and conservation funding decisions. In U.S. rangelands, state-and-transition models have been developed within the Ecological Site Description (ESD) Database as an application of alternative state theory and to move the discipline toward a more dynamic platform for resource management. After 15 years of development, and with government-mandated collaboration among federal agencies, these models are set to become one of the world's largest guiding frameworks for terrestrial ecosystem management. Yet, ESD state-and-ransition models are being marketed for broad-scale application without a national-level critique evaluating their strengths and limitations. In this article, we conduct a national assessment of ESDs with a central focus on evaluating the specific details of ESD state-and-transition models. Importantly, we are not evaluating the conceptual underpinnings of the state-and-transition management framework, but rather its application. Specifically, we (1) quantify and summarize the information presented in ESD state-and-ransition models; (2) determine whether ESDs fully meet U.S. Congress's goal of a nationally consistent system for defining, mapping, and interpreting ecological sites; (3) identify limitations and logical holes in ESD predictions; and (4) evaluate whether conservation funding priorities are consistent with output from ESDs. Our evaluation reveals multiple shortcomings in the application of the state-and-transition model concept within ESDs, primarily that they are highly subjective, inconsistent in design and application, focus on a single historical climax community, and overuse grazing as a driver of both ecological degradation and restoration. Considering that many of these limitations have been a consistent criticism of rangeland assessment procedures throughout the history of the discipline, state-and-transition models within ESDs will require major reconstruction beyond the current plans for revision if they are to meet society's demand for more effective management and utilization of rangeland resources. While ESDs were developed to link science and management in rangeland ecology, our assessment suggests well-intentioned management frameworks built upon expert opinion and qualitative inputs will not effectively shift ecosystem management from long-held practices rooted in community climax theory to modern scientific perspectives based on alternative state theory.

AB  - A series of polyhalogenated hetarylamines and their co-crystals with 18-crown-6 ether was used to reveal the effect of co-crystallization on the supramolecular structure and fluorescence properties as well as the relationship between these characteristics and peculiarities of the hetarylamine chemical structure (alpha- or gamma-position of the NH2 group, number of Cl and F substituents, pyridine or quinoline framework, presence of a fluorophore fragment). Incorporation of crown ether into the crystal matrix of the hetarylamine results in a significant rearrangement of the supramolecular structure. In all cases, the N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISNhet and N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISF H-bonds are replaced by the N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISOcrown bond. Changes in pi-electron interactions that affect fluorescence characteristics depend on the amine structure. In the co-crystals of gamma-aminopyridines, replacement of C-FMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi(F) interactions with pi FMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi(F) stacking causes the fluorescence quenching or a bathochromic shift of lambda(em), whereas replacement of pi FMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi(F) or pi FMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi(H) stacking with C-FMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi(F) interactions or pi HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi(H) stacking in the co-crystals of alpha-aminopyridines is accompanied by the hypsochromic shift of lambda(em). gamma-Aminopyridines show more pronounced changes in fluorescence characteristics as compared to alpha-aminopyridines, the effect being dependent on the nature of the halogen substituents. The fluorescence properties of aminoquinolines, regardless of the amino group location, are insignificantly modified due to the ability of the extended pi-system to minimize interaction changes. Exploration of the nature of the excited states of isolated molecules, homocrystals and co-crystals using quantum mechanical calculations evidences that fluorescence quenching occurs due to EET, facilitated by the presence of crown ether molecules. The bathochromic and hypsochromic shifts of emission are caused by the change in a mutual orientation of the hetarylamine molecules with subsequent different stabilization of the ground and excited states. Using DSC, the co-crystals' supramolecular structure was found to self-organize from solution or melt and to regenerate in the melting-crystallization cycle. The revealed modification of the hetarylamines' fluorescence properties due to the formation of co-crystals with crown ether seems to be promising for use in solid-state supramolecular chemo and thermo sensors (indicators).

AB  - The research determined the influence of environmental factors on the state of the population of stem pests of the family Ipidae in Polissya pine and spruce forests (Sumy obast, Ukraine). The study used the "model trees" methodology, which is based on the artificial laying of hunting trees and the creation of attractive conditions for bark beetles. The colonization of bark beetles depended on the category of sanitary condition of trees, and the distribution of wood by categories depended on the conditions of the year and the type of ecosystem under study. Pests of the family Ipidae did not inhabit trees belonging to the category I of sanitary condition, the trees belonging to the second category, to a large extent the trees belonging to the III and IV, and 100% inhabited the plantations of V-V. categories. The research revealed 5 species of pests from the family Ipidae: Blastophagus minor Hart., Blastophagus piniperda L., Ips acuminatus Gyll., Ips typographus L., Ips sexdentatus Boern. Dominant species were I. typographus and B. piniperda on the studied areas of pine and spruce forests. The location of I. typographus varied within 24.0-32.3% in pine plantations and 31,2-37,7% in spruce stands. The position of B. piniperda ranged from 26.1 to 28.9% in pine forests and from 26.5 to 28.0% in spruce forests. I. acuminatus populated 10.1-15.6% of pine and 8.0-9.9% of spruce trees. The occurrence of B. minor and I. sexdentatus was respectively 3.8-5.6 and 1.0-1.5%. The research revealed a significantly higher relative density of B. piniperda in the pine forest than in spruce, and a significant reduction in the indicator in each subsequent year of the study in both types of plantings. Relative density of I. typographus remained stable within all studied period on spruce forests. The ecological density depended on the volume of the feed substrate, and the volume depended on the species and taxonomic parameters of the tree, such as the length and diameter of the barrel. The ecological density of B. piniperda and I. typographus was significantly higher in pine plantations than in spruce forests, with a significant decrease in each subsequent year in both types of plantings. It is projected that climate will warm in future and forestry activities will intensify. As a result, a drastic change in tree species composition and biology of pest development will contribute to the new outbreaks of the mass distribution of bark beetles. Therefore the control and management of their numbers will require further research.

AB  - Complex and contradictory processes of modern social transformations and the need to overcome the crisis in the economy require the appropriate influence of the state and a clear system of socio-economic management through the formation and implementation of effective state economic policy. The main elements of economic policy are financial and credit, budgetary, scientific and technical, structural, social, investment, agricultural, regional, foreign economic policy. The implementation of state economic policy is considered in terms of the relationship between social problems and the state. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to study the essence, tools and methods of state economic policy in modern conditions. It is also necessary to identify the main risks and features of further development of state economic policy of individual states in a global imbalance and crisis. The theoretical part is devoted to the study of the essence of state economic policy, theoretical and practical aspects of its organization in the state, as well as tools that can be used by the state. The resulting part is devoted to the consideration of the situation, in which the world economy has found itself in 2020 in the conditions of the economic COVID-19 crisis. General forecasts have not provided to individual states because it has been impossible to predict the end of the pandemic and the return of the world to normal life. However, it is clear that the world economy has undergone irreversible processes that will synergistically affect different states in different ways. The crisis has hit a significant number of industries, including tourism, logistics, hotel business, the crisis has been felt in world markets: oil prices have collapsed, as well as the stock markets. Undoubtedly, there are areas with a rapid growth, especially the pharmaceutical industry and retail, online delivery services, IT entertainment and communications industry, information marketing business and education and training services. It is likely that the indicators of economic development in the states by the end of the year will be better than the results of the first half of the year. The basic forecast of economic world development assumes a sharp growth of the economy after a short recession after quarantine. The financial capabilities of the EU states vary considerably, but each state must pursue counter-cyclical policies aimed at stabilizing its own economy. The answer to the question of what kind of crisis response policy they can afford depends on the fiscal policy of the states before the crisis. In economically developed states, where emergency measures have been introduced, governments and central banks issue trillions of dollars in government spending, social support of citizens, and interest-free business loans to limit the economic damage of quarantine. At the same time, in Latin America and Southeast Asia, total quarantine is impossible in multi-million cities. Such states have a triple effect of suffering from the virus, the environment and poverty. States dependent on the export of natural resources and raw materials, when faced with the crisis, are forced to sell them for nothing, so they will suffer great losses. More than 150 states have set up anti-crisis headquarters and are taking anti-crisis measures. The authors have also tried to predict how large scale the global economic crisis will be for Ukraine, what consequences await it, and what measures need to be taken to overcome it.

AB  - Mexico, like many other countries worldwide, faces an environmental crisis of enormous proportions. While in its urban dimension environmental problems are more similar to those of developed countries, in rural areas they are analogous to those prevailing in developing countries. In rural areas, which are largely devoted to food production based on traditional methods, environmental concerns are mainly related to phenomena such as deforestation and soil erosion, and not to chemical pollution or ozone-layer depletion, which are the primary concerns of the broad public. The future food production in these regions and the possibility of improving the life quality of their inhabitants depend on our understanding of these kinds of problems, and our capacity to confront them.
   An overview of the theoretical framework on environmental deterioration reveals a lack of definition of the concepts and terms related to this issue. Several terms, such as ''desertification'' and ''fragmentation,'' among others, are widely used by ecologists but are clearly not synonymous with environmental deterioration. A consequence of this vagueness is the lack of clear criteria to differentiate areas that are only moderately modified from those in which true deterioration has occurred. Also, unified methods to efficiently evaluate environmental deterioration in rural areas are lacking.
   We briefly present a case study in which environmental deterioration was evaluated in La Montana, an extremely poor and climatically and topographically heterogeneous rural region inhabited by indigenous people in southern Mexico. Three deterioration categories are recognized based on degree of human influence, proportion of vegetation cover, and soil erosion severity. Use of air photogrammetry supplemented with field surveys revealed that 13% of La Montana is already damaged (i.e., lacking native vegetation and affected, perhaps irreversibly, by severe erosion), while 36% is altered (i.e., where native vegetation is substantially modified, but productive activities are still possible). In turn, almost three quarters of the land in the latter category is at high risk of becoming damaged. An analysis of the patterns of land-use changes around selected villages for the period 1979-1992 showed local annual deforestation rates ranging between 1 and 17%, depending upon climatic conditions.
   Based on the conceptual review and the analysis of the case study, we suggest that environmental deterioration comprises at least three clearly distinct dimensions: the abiotic setting, the biological attributes, and the social characteristics of the process. Finally, we define environmental deterioration as any modification of the environment that implies a reduction or loss of its physical and biological qualities, caused by natural phenomena or human activities, ultimately representing a decrease in the availability of ecosystem goods and services to human populations.
   The methods used to evaluate environmental deterioration at La Montana allowed us to separate modifications that cause deterioration from those that do not. This investigation, carried out in a relatively short time and with a minimum financial investment, yielded a satisfactory assessment of the state of the environment at the regional and community scales, recognizing early indicators of deterioration. This approach may be particularly useful in rural regions that share many characteristics with La Montana, such as critical environmental problems, extreme poverty, and insufficient background information about these issues.

AB  - Transformation of river and stream channels disrupts their natural ecological cycles and interrupts the continuum of their ecosystems. Changes in natural hydromorphological conditions transform lotic communities into those atypical of flowing waters, resulting in bioassessment procedures yielding incorrect results. This study shows how hydromorphological transformations of ecosystems affect the ecological status bioassessment results by disturbing diatom communities typical for rivers. Moreover, the article presents a new biological assessment procedure for urban transformed rivers including the verification of the community structure based on autecology and quantity of species. The ecological status of the ecosystem was assessed using benthic diatom assemblages and supported with results of hydrochemical analysis. The structure of the assemblages and their relationships between individual sampling sites were clarified by shade plot and multivariate data analyses. The analysis of dominant species vitality at sampling sites and their autecology gave the foundation for modification of taxa data matrix and recalculation the diatom indices. Biological assessment showed that one of the artificial ponds constructed at the stream channel was characterized by good ecological status, and its presence strongly affected the state of the downstream ecosystem following the development of a unique assemblage of diatoms that prefer oligosaprobic and oligotrophic waters. The presence of these species was also noted in the downstream sections, but most of the cells were dead. As the indicator values of these taxa are high, their presence artificially increased the ecological status of the stream, resulting in the hydrochemical assessment not being in line with the bioassessment. Therefore, a new procedure was adopted in which non-characteristic taxa for the downstream sections were excluded from analysis. This approach corrected the results of bioassessment characterizing the ecological status of the stream as poor along its entire course, with the exception of this unique pond. For hydromorphologically transformed streams and rivers with disturbed channel continuity, the correct result of an incorrect diatom-based bioassessment may be retrieved after excluding species unusual for the type of ecosystem from the studied assemblages, i.e., the species which are unable to reproduce in that area and are only carried into it by the water flow. Assessment of the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems based on biotic factors is an essential tool of aquatic ecosystems monitoring in many countries. This type of assessment requires a multifaceted approach, in particular, to identify factors that may disrupt this assessment. Standardization of biomonitoring methods is an important step in correct assessment; thus, the findings of this paper will be useful in routine biomonitoring around the world.

AB  - Eutrophication is still one of the most important, world - wide problems of surface waters. During last decades there is the increasing demand for effective methods of monitoring systems based on biotic indices. For practical application, the monitoring tools must satisfy certain requirements: (1) sampling should be quick and easy; (2) indices should be straightforward to calculate. The aim of the study was to test the usefulness of rotifer abundance and species composition as indicators of trophic state of lakes. Data on rotifer densities and taxonomic composition were collected in 41 dimictic and 33 polymictic lakes situated in northeastern Poland. The samples were taken once a year, during the summer stagnation period at 1 m intervals from the surface to the bottom of the epilimnion layer in thermally stratified lakes and from the surface to the bottom of shallow lakes. The data were used to estimate the relationship between the rotifer community structure and the indices of trophic state of lakes (TSI), like concentration of chlorophyll a and Secchi's disc visibility, (as the estimator of suspended particulate material in the water) calculated according to Carlson (1977) and widely used recently. The estimations were made separately for dimictic and polymictic lakes. However, regressions for the relationships between the trophic state of lakes based on mean values for Secchi's disc (TSISD) and chlorophyll a content (TSICHL) and rotifer indices for both groups of lakes, usually were not different. Thus the same regression equations may be used for both dimictic and polymictic lakes.
   The following formulas for rotifer TSI index (TSIROT) were found: (1) rotifer numbers (N, ind L-1): TSIROT1 = 5.38 Ln(N) + 19.28; (2) total biomass of rotifer community (B, mg w.wt. L-1): TSIROT2 = 5.63 Ln(B) + 64.47; (3) percentage of bacterivores in total rotifer numbers (BAC, %): TSIROT3 = 0.23 BAC+ 44.30; (4) ratio of biomass to numbers (B:N, mg w.wt. ind.(-1)): TSIROT4 = 3.85 (B:N)(-0.318); (5) percentage of the tecta form in the population of Keratella cochlearis (TECTA, %): TSIROT5 = 0.198 TECTA + 48.8 for dimictic lakes and TSIROT5 = 0.144 TECTA + 54.8 for polymictic ones; (6) contribution of species which indicate high trophic state in the indicatory group's numbers (IHT, %): TSIROT6 = 0.203 IHT + 40.0. It was assumed that the lakes with a TSIROT under 45 are mesotrophic, those with a TSIROT value of 45-55 are mcso-eutrophic, 55-65 - eutrophic and those with a TSIROT above 65 - hypertrophic. The formulas may be useful in preparing similar indices for lakes in central and northern Europe.

AB  - Semi-natural open habitats in north-western Europe are highly prioritized for conservation, and optimization of management planning is essential for continued protection of their diversity. We evaluate whether current management practices, which consist mainly of summer grazing by livestock, are sufficient to maintain plant species composition in a stable state across semi-natural areas in Denmark, or if shifts in functional composition are taking place. Further, we investigate important drivers of any ongoing changes through trait differences between winner and loser species. Using a data set of 6513 annually inventoried (2004-2010) vegetation plots from 202 semi-natural NATURA 2000 protected areas, we assessed changes in cover of all plant species and, using boosted regression trees, whether winners and losers differ in regard to autecological characteristics and traits. There were consistent changes in cover for 123 out of 603 species across the 6-year study period, with more species losing than winning (78 vs. 45). Winner and loser species were strongly differentiated by competition-related traits, but traits related to soil nutrients and soil moisture also had some importance. Generally, our results indicate a trend towards taller and more competitive species.Synthesis and applications. Despite conservation actions in order to maintain a so-called favourable conservation status, vegetation in NATURA 2000 protected areas is still undergoing compositional changes. Overall, autecological characteristics and trait differences between winners and losers match expectations given the contemporary anthropogenic pressures, especially reduced livestock grazing. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition and increased soil moisture due to reduced drainage might also be involved in observed changes. Current management (i.e. summer grazing by livestock) is insufficient to preserve the diversity of less-competitive, low-statured and stress-tolerant herbaceous species, potentially leading to species losses. Such patterns can thus be expected across semi-natural ecosystems in north-western Europe and other places where traditional land use (i.e. previous widespread extensive livestock grazing) have been replaced with various degrees of conservation management. A greater focus on returning large grazing herbivores to conservation areas is recommended for the protection of plant species diversity and to counteract ongoing changes.

AB  - In the Polish enterprises to mid-90s of the twentieth century the issue of work safety was based mainly on retrospective analysis of safety (the study of the causes and circumstances of past accidents). During that period, together with structural change and economic development there are new concepts, among which the next to quality management and environmental management should also mention management of work safety. The term "health and safety management system" (HSMS) should be treated as simplify of thinking, which relates to organizational performance and decision making processes undertaken within the functions of management. The essence of philosophy HSMS best describes the statement of its creator D. Paterson, saying that "hazardous activities, hazardous conditions and accidents, are events which are a manifestation of interference in the management system".
   About the needed to implement the principles of health and safety management system (HSMS) show both the limited effectiveness of existing methods of security analysis (these methods are mainly based on grouping and balancing the number of accidents and the assessment retrospective models and their causes and circumstances), and the reasons: the nature law (the need to adapt legal solution of the country to the requirements in force in EU member states), the nature of organizational (need for the use and processing of information resources on the state of existing hazards and exposures), an economic nature (the problem of relations with the insurance premiums threat risk categories) and social (lack of social acceptance for work in conditions that threaten life and health of the employee.).
   In Poland, in accordance with the applicable regulations for the employer to ensure safe and healthy working conditions. Currently technical measures to improve the quality of health and safety have reached a satisfactory level so that possibilities of improving the security situation is increasingly placed in the attitudes and behaviors of people in the work process. Therefore, the next study the causes and circumstances of past accidents, are taken the activities of a preventive nature aimed at exploring the potential threats. These objectives can be realized, among others by audit testing research of health and safety management system (in the whole work establishment or separate elements in its structure), and professional risk management procedures (analysis and risk assessment).
   In this article discusses the procedures involved in testing the quality of health and safety management work on the example of one of the positions (the operator of equipment - landfill) located at municipal waste dumping ground in the northwestern part of Silesia. In the study of audit testing of the health and safety management system was used a MERIT questionnaire (which includes 9 problem areas) and within risk assessment a method of PN-N18002:2000 and the method of the Silesian University. In the case of audit testing the areas that are highest rated was Area B - "A a study the accidents", C - "The control and inspection of safety", and E - "The Personal Protection", for which the final values of indicators evaluations amounted to: for the area B - 3.78, for area C - 3.65, and for the area of E - 3.12. The areas of the lowest evaluated was: area A - "Planning activities in the area of safety management" (index value WOPA = 1.85), Area G - "Information of the state of health and safety "(index value WOPG = 2.1) and area H -"Promoting Health and Safety "(index value WOPH = 2,1). Risk assessment carried out by two methods helped define both sources of risk / exposure (method PN-N18002:2000) as well as the type of work activities, during the execution are created the potentially the greatest danger / endangering the health / life of the employee (the method of the Silesian University of Technology). The biggest threat to a person employed as an equipment operator - waste dumps pose a elements of substantive the environment. This situation results from the use of the compactor (vibration, noise, dust) and work on the the area of bottom of the trough, in which the processes of putrefaction (landfill gases, bacterias). Therefore, the occupational risk which was determined by using the PN_N18002:2000 for the above sources of threat has been assessed at high risk. Activities are the most dangerous a riding by a compactor (240 min.) and a segregation of materials (150 min). In both cases we have to deal with a important risk.

AB  - Collaborative Adaptive Management (CAM) program stakeholders informally assess program progress through subjective assessments regularly. Each stakeholder does this by individually selecting objective progress indicators based on their needs, values, and preferences. They do this even though there may be a stakeholder group agreed-on set of progress objectives. Individual stakeholder indicators may be a subset of the group set or outside of the agreed-on set. This is because many factors influence behavior, and stakeholders may act differently in group settings as opposed to individual settings. These assessments can provide valuable information about stakeholder needs that are not being met, and potential motivations for stakeholders circumventing a CAM process. They can also provide information, beyond the normal measures, about the importance of system components and relationships that are keys to progress and action. Progress is important to continued support for these publically funded CAM programs. The Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program (AMP) and the Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) were used to explore the idea of integrating stakeholder assessments into CAM progress measurement. A study using a framework with AMP stakeholders was conducted to measure progress, whereas examples from MRRP were used to explain how the framework could be used to understand real scenarios of stakeholder behavior related to unmet needs and individual measures of progress. Integration of stakeholder attitudes and behavior in CAM progress evaluation can yield important results. Stakeholders' attitudes and corresponding behaviors can affect a CAM program's progress. Gathering data on their attitudes can help decision makers understand stakeholders' perceptions of progress and avoid potential blocks to progress. There are differences among stakeholders in the indicators they consider as relevant to the assessment of progress. Elucidating these differences can provide useful information about system components and relationships that are important to public support of a CAM program and progress. One of the sources of differences in progress assessments among stakeholders comes from their diverse perceptions about the desired and current states of the social-ecological systems. Stakeholder behavior can be inconsistent between group and individual settings. Individually they may make plans, based on their assessments, that do not conform to the group plan because of their unique interests and preferences. The results of this study need to be further tested. The framework should be used through multiple cycles to determine whether the information gathered with this approach results in additional progress as compared with past approaches. In particular, it would be helpful to test whether gathering such information resulted in a decrease in stakeholders electing to go outside of the CAM process to get their needs met.

AB  - An ecosystem approach to the management of the marine environment has received considerable attention over recent years. However, there are few examples which demonstrate its practical implementation. Much of this relates to the history of existing marine monitoring and assessment programmes which (for many countries) are sectoral, making it difficult to integrate monitoring data and knowledge across programmes at the operational level.
   To address this, a scientific expert group, under the auspices of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), prepared a plan for how ICES could contribute to the development of an Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) for the North Sea by undertaking a pilot study utilising marine monitoring data. This paper presents the main findings arising from the expert group and in particular it sets out one possible integrated approach for assessing the relative significance of environmental forcing and fishing pressure on the ecological status of the North Sea, it then compares the findings with assessments made of other Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs).
   We define the North Sea ecosystem on the basis of 114 state and pressure variables resolved as annual averages between 1983 and 2003 and at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles. The paper presents results of integrated time-series and spatial analysis which identifies and explains significant spatial and temporal gradients in the data. For example, a significant shift in the status of the North Sea ecosystem (based upon 114 state-pressure variables) is identified to have occurred around 1993. This corresponds to previously documented shifts in the environmental conditions (particularly sea surface temperature) and changes in the distribution of key species of plankton (Calanus sp.), both reported to have occurred in 1989. The difference in specific timing between reported regime shifts for the North Sea may be explained, in part, by time-lag dependencies in the trophic structure of the ecosystem with shifts in higher trophic levels occurring later than 1989.
   By examining the connection (or relatedness) between ecosystem components (e.g. environment, plankton, fish, fishery and seabirds) for the identified regime states (1983-1993; 1993-2003) we conclude that both the North Sea pelagic and benthic parts of the ecosystem were predominantly top-down (fishery) controlled between 1983 and 1993, whereas between 1993 and 2003 the pelagic stocks shifted to a state responding mainly to bottom-up (environment) influences. However, for the demersal fish stocks between 1993 and 2003 top-down (fishery) pressure dominated even though over this period significant reductions in fishing pressure occurred. The present analysis, therefore, provides further evidence in support of the need for precautionary management measures taken in relation to setting fishery quotas.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Phytoplankton, as a first step in trophic cascades of lakes, can be a good indicator of trophic states, considering that every environmental change affects this community and many species of this community are sensitive to changes, and that they response very quickly. In this study, we tried to assess and predict the trophic state of Lake Skadar according to phytoplankton data.
   Methods. Water samples were collected using Ruttner sampling bottle. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, ph, conductivity and transparence were measured in situ using portable equipment. Nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured using standard spectrophotometric methods. A determination of phytoplankton species was performed using relevant keys and the counting of cells was performed using sedimentation methods.
   Results and Discussion. The species composition of Lake Skadar revealed 95 taxa, with Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae being represented best. According to an average chlorophyll a concentration of 5.9 mu g/l, Lake Skadar belongs to the mesotrophic level of the trophic scale. Developed prediction equation for chlorophyll a revealed a good prediction (R-2=0.71) and the parameter Secchi depth was primarily correlated with chlorophyll a concentration. Trophic state indices derived from chlorophyll a and transparency, were close together, but both were below the phosphorous index. Values of trophic state indices rank the Lake Skadar as being mesotrophic. This study also showed that indices of diversity based on phytoplankton are weak indicators of trophic status and that they can well characterize only differences between assemblages and associations. According to calculated saprobic indices (ranging from 1.5 to 2.15), Lake Skadar is on betamesosaprobic level of saprobity, which means that it is moderately polluted with organic compounds.
   Conclusions. Total phosphorus is not the main limiting factor for the phytoplankton community in Lake Skadar. Disagreements between chlorophyll and the transparency index, on the one hand, and the total phosphorus index, on the other, suggest that the phytoplankton in Lake Skadar is probably limited by other factors than phosphorus, such as nitrogen, toxic substances or intense zooplankton grazing. According to the majority of investigated parameters and indices derived from phytoplankton data, Lake Skadar is mesotrophic, with tendencies toward eutrophic levels during the summer period.
   Recommendations and Outlook. Long-term monitoring is required for a better estimation of state and the conditions of Lake Skadar. Further studies on factors influencing the phytoplankton community, especially zooplankton grazing and toxic substances, which were not included in this study, should be continued in the future to improve the efficiency of phytoplankton usage in estimating the ecological and trophic conditions of Lake Skadar.

AB  - Intensification of destabilizing processes in the world economy, increasing the impact of global challenges and the spread of uncertainty in the conditions of economic activity actualize scientific research to ensure a high level of economic security of countries and regions. This in turn requires a thorough systematic analysis and assessment of the level of security and the state of the security environment based on the development of appropriate methodological tools. Taking it into account, the presented research is aimed at developing a system for monitoring and assessing the level of security development of the countries of the European region, based on the tools of multidimensional assessment and construction of complex integrated indicators. The article is aimed to development of the system for monitoring and assessing the EU security level, which consists of comprehensive assessment of the formation of security development factors, construction of the security level integrated indexes, which allowes to classify the EU countries according to the security level, to identify the features and intensity of the influence of the different determinants on the security level formation, to establish the peculiarities of the EU countries distribution within the regional security space. The object of the study is the regional security complex of the EU, based on the monitoring system - 24 indicators, which are systematized by nature (economic, socio-demographic, environmental) and direction of impact (incentives, disincentives), which are assessed for the period 2010-2019. The results show a high assessment of the integrated level of security in countries such as Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany; Ireland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, and Denmark have the highest security positions in terms of the economic component of the security level, Cyprus, Slovenia, Ireland, Luxembourg and Slovenia in terms of socio-demographic, and Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Finland and Portugal in terms of environmental security. The reduced impact of the economic security component factors, maintaining a moderate impact of the socio-demographic security component factors, the increasing influence of the environmental factors are determined. Statistical analysis of the distribution of the EU countries by security level in 2010-2019 confirmed the tendency to equalize the level of security development of the EU countries within the regional security complex, to reduce the level of variation of integrated assessments of security levels, to increase the share of countries with high levels. Building a matrix of positioning of the EU countries by the integrated level of security and the intensity of its dynamics allowed to divide the countries and zones of relative security and danger, and to determine that the most risky positions are in Italy, Bulgaria and Romania. The practical significance of the results of the study lies in the possibility of applying the proposed system of monitoring the level of security in the development and implementation of regional security strategy of the EU development, which will more effectively monitor changes, prevent risks and threats, prevent negative consequences.

AB  - Forest management must change radically to maintain biodiversity. 'Biodiversity' has many components, but only one has been measured unambiguously - species richness - although there is recently much emphasis on structural, process, and functional diversity. So we must determine exactly what aspects of biodiversity to seek, and why. A battery of suggestions about how to achieve this re-focus on biodiversity (e.g., ecosystem management and the 'new forestry') are catchwords rather than guides on how to manage forests on the ground. These suggestions stem from an ill-defined concept of 'forest health,' which can be seen variously depending on the desired role and state of a forest. Ecosystem management for some versions of forest health may even decrease some forms of biodiversity. A decline in species richness need not lead to a decline in the process diversity or rates. Evidence that species richness contributes to ecosystem maintenance and function is scant. Thus, effective management for biodiversity (generally species richness) entails a frank commitment to maintain biodiversity as an end, not as a means. Some suggestions to maintain forest biodiversity while still allowing timber production, such as uneven-aged stand management and various burning regimes, are focused squarely on species richness per se, but they are hypotheses, not scientifically validated procedures. Existing empirical measurements on such techniques are usually on the amount and sustainability of timber harvest, not on how well they maintain species richness. A wealth of scientific research is needed, involving landscape-level field manipulations and careful natural historical observations on the effects on various species. The idea that forests can always serve multiple uses, including wood production and maintenance of all species, is an untested hypothesis. It may be incorrect; maintaining some species may require extensive pristine tracts. The major requirement for almost all research needed to manage forests for biodiversity is extensive and intensive monitoring. The concepts of umbrella and indicator species as management shortcuts are barely tested. Their utility can be validated only by intensive field study. Valuable umbrellas and/or indicators may exist for some forest systems. However, management procedures should not evolve towards management of indicator species, as the indicator might cease to indicate the status of other species. By contrast, managing an umbrella species is not an inherent contradiction in terms, but different umbrella species may shelter different sets of species, so management for one might be inimical to the other. The concept of keystone species may be useful in forest management. If the fates of particular species determine those of many others, managing for such keystones may effectively maintain species richness. But recognition of a keystone species requires well-designed experiments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that ecosystem health describes the state in which all processes operating within an ecosystem are functioning at a level of optimum efficiency to maximize system empower. In this study, systems analysis of networks and information flows is used within this definition of ecosystem health to assess the condition of the benthic ecosystems in three coastal bays in northern Chile. These highly productive ecosystems are characterized by the inflow of cold, nutrient-rich waters of low oxygen concentration derived from coastal upwelling of deep waters and the interruption of upwelling flow during El Nino events when warmer waters with higher oxygen and lower nutrient concentrations enter these coastal systems. Also, these ecosystems support important artisanal benthic fisheries and are affected by industrial activities in the coastal zone. Energy Systems Theory (EST) and Emergy Analysis (EA) (Emergy is defined as the sum of the available energy (i.e., energy with the potential to do work) of one kind, e.g., solar joules, which is used-up, directly and indirectly, within an ecosystem for the production of goods and services were applied to quantify the health of these benthic ecosystems and evaluate differences in their structure, organization and functional capacities, which are related to their emergy signatures. The marked dominance of these benthic ecosystems by nitrate from upwelling resulted in unbalanced emergy signatures, suggesting less development and system diversity compared to other coastal ecosystems with more balanced emergy signatures. Macro-descriptors and network properties, such as emergy-based ascendency and the quality-adjusted Shannon diversity index (the proportion of total system emergy flow allocated to each component) were highest for Mejillones Bay, followed by Antofagasta and then Tongoy Bay. The Average Mutual Information (AMI) index adjusted for energy quality (the number and diversity of emergy-weighted interactions among the system components) and the emergy-based A/C (ascendency to capacity) ratio (this index has been suggested as a maturity index), were higher for Tongoy Bay, suggesting functional differences in health among the three ecosystems. Thus, the emergy-based macro descriptors and other indicators used in our analysis indicate that the benthic networks examined have different structural and functional characteristics that lead to different characterizations of their states of health. As a result of this complexity, management policies should be implemented within a systemic context for analysis that considers all the factors determining the relative health of each ecosystem.

AB  - Introduction. According to official statistics, regions of Ukraine are characterized by a significant amount of pollutant emissions from stationary sources. But in many areas the dominant contribution to the formation of general levels of air pollution is made by mobile sources. Such regions include the Odessa, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions of the North-Western Black Sea. Regions of the North-Western Black Sea are characterized by a sufficiently high level of technogenic load and have a high recreational potential. This territory is characterized by unique natural resource potential. However, due to the development of urbanization processes, the impact of industrial, transport and agrarian sectors is worsening the overall environmental situation, including the state of the atmospheric air.
   Review of previous publications. The work of many authors is devoted to the question of the level of air pollution in the cities of the North-Western Black Sea. Most of the works are complex studies of the level of pollution of the regions of Ukraine as a whole. Some works are devoted to the assessment of the technogenic load on the environment of the regions of Ukraine. An analysis of recent research has shown that the vast majority of work is devoted to the regions of Ukraine as a whole. Also, the list of pollutants and the study period are quite limited. Usually, the content of the main pollutants is analyzed. At the same time, the content of specific pollutants is very important in the regions of the North-Western Black Sea in the formation of high levels of atmospheric pollution.
   Purpose. The purpose of this work is to evaluate and analyze the level of air pollution of individual cities of the North-Western Black Sea over a multi-year period. The complex atmospheric pollution index, which are currently one of the main indicators of atmospheric air quality, were used for the assessment.
   Results. The level of air pollution in Odessa is in most cases classified as "heavily polluted", Izmail the only category "slightly polluted" (maximum concentrations in the air pool are marked by the content of formaldehyde). In Mykolayiv maximum concentrations with significant exceedances of the maximum permissible concentration are also noted for formaldehyde content, and the level of atmospheric air pollution was classified as "poorly polluted" - "contaminated". In Kherson, the highest content was observed for substances such as formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide. The level of pollution, as in the city of Mykolaiv, was classified as "poorly contaminated" - "contaminated".
   Conclusions. Odessa, by the content of the vast majority of the pollutants, is in the category of cities with high levels of atmospheric pollution, Mykolaiv, Kherson and Izmail - in the category with the permissible level. The results of the study are the basis for the development of environmental recommendations for reducing the emissions of pollutants into the atmospheric air of the region, primarily from mobile sources.

AB  - The European Water Policy and, in particular, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC introduced the necessity to evaluate new methodological approaches for the development of Water Management Strategies oriented to support Sustainable Development. In the context of the EUROCAT Project, the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was identified as a possible analysis framework for the development of management strategies according to the European Water Policy. An ad-hoc DPSIR framework was developed for the Po River Catchment and the North Adriatic coastal zone in order to elaborate possible strategies for controlling and/or reducing eutrophication. This approach combines socio-economic analysis with spatial analysis of pollutant transport and impact on the catchment-coastal zone system. The preliminary evaluation of the DPSIR approach highlighted the fact that the major Driving forces are agriculture and livestock activities and the civil and industrial sectors. Before establishing possible management strategies, it is necessary to assess the relevance of each Driving force on eutrophication in terms of Pressure factors. Combining socio-economic analysis with the evaluation of major nutrient pathways, it is possible to understand the relationship between the socio-economic development of the Po basin and eutrophication in coastal zone. The nutrient loads, i.e. the Pressures deriving from each Driver were evaluated in terms of potential and effective loads. Fifty-one percent of the Nitrogen load (carried in superficial waters) derives from agriculture and livestock (fertilizer use and manure spreading), while 40% from civil and industrial sectors. Concerning phosphorus loads the major contribution is provided by civil and industrial sectors (62% of total phosphorus load). The DPSIR development permits the identification of the impact of socio-economic development on the qualitative state of both marine and superficial waters in terms of interaction between the trophic system and ecological conditions. The qualitative state of the Po River and the main tributaries ranges between the sufficient and good levels evaluated using the Macro-descriptor Pollution Level Index (LIM). The bulk of nutrients discharged into the North Adriatic coastal zone generate the change of environmental conditions in terms of loss of water qualitative state. The assessment of the water qualitative state for marine waters was performed using an appropriate indicator the Trophic Index (TRIX) according to the Italian legislative framework (Dlgs. 152/1999). Knowledge of the main biogeochemical processes of nutrients and the assessments of DPSIR components is the starting point for the scenario analysis.

AB  - Two cores of intertidal mangrove sediments from the Tanmen and Qinglan Harbors on Hainan Island, China, were investigated for their geochemical characteristics of carbon, nitrogen, iron and sulfur and the pyrite morphology and framboidal pyrite size distribution.
   A modified sequential iron extraction procedure revealed extremely high Fe-HR/Fe-T ratios (0.81 +/- 0.07, n=28). The pyrite results determined by the nitric acid digestion and chromium reduction method show a strong correlation (r=0.91, n=28), indicating that most of the chromium-reducible sulfur is pyrite, whereas the proportion of elemental sulfur is minor. The organic carbon concentrations and the atomic C/N ratios demonstrate that the organic carbon in the mangrove sediments is derived predominantly from higher plants. The chromium-reducible sulfur (CRS) values show a good linear logarithmic correlation with the total organic carbon (TOC), indicating that the process of sulfate reduction increases rapidly with the concentration of TOC at Qinglan Harbor (QL), which has low TOC contents (<5 wt%). In contrast, sulfate reduction increases slowly with high TOC (>5 wt%) at Tanmen Harbor (TM). These data suggest that pyrite formation at the QL site is controlled by the TOC contents, whereas at the TM site, the primary factor controlling the pyritization process is the supply rate of sulfate. Both sites have significantly high sulfate contents (average 1.67 +/- 0.45 wt% and 0.80 +/- 032 wt% at Tanmen and Qinglan, respectively), which are isotopically depleted in S-34 (average-6.15 +/- 7.17 parts per thousand and -6.72 +/- 7.33 parts per thousand at Tanmen and Qinglan, respectively) suggesting that the sulfate is mainly from the reoxidation of reduced sulfides (mainly pyrite) instead of seawater sulfate during burial.
   The distributions of pyrite textures suggest that the pyrite in the mangrove swamps is formed mainly as framboids and only a few pyrite crystals are formed directly as euhedral crystals. The high mean diameters and standard deviations (7.0 +/- 4.6 mu m and 6.1 +/- 4.1 mu m at Tanmen and Qinglan, respectively) are compatible with previous observations in oxic and dysoxic environments. At the TM site, we observed a notable double-hump phenomenon in the framboid size distribution and a greater number of secondary framboids between the 50 and 100 cm layers, suggesting different pyrite growth events than are present at QL site. There are remarkable increases in the sulfur isotopic fractionations between the CRS and the add-dissolvable sulfate in several layers of the QL site (e.g., >10 parts per thousand at 10, 20, 80 and 110-120 cm depths), demonstrating that the reoxidized sulfate could then be re-reduced to create greater S-34 depletions in sulfides relative to the acid-dissolvable sulfate. In addition, the small mean diameters and standard deviations of framboid size in these layers are much closer to those of dysoxic sediments (e.g., the Peru margin) where the redox conditions may be suitable for the re-reduction of partial sulfate derived from the reoxidation of reduced sulfur. Generally, these data provide evidence that the sudden redox turnover caused by the oxygen input during ebb tides or bioturbation occurs in both mangrove swamps, leading to a significant reoxidation of reduced sulfurs.

AB  - ''Species-centered Environmental analysis'' (SCEA) is a procedure for diagnosing species-specific environmental factors that limit the size of a population. It attempts to identify presently recognized biotic and abiotic limiting factors. Then, through comparisons and applications of the principles of experimental design, it evaluates the relative importance of the factors and searches for new ones. The advantage of SCEA is that it frames ecological hypotheses in a context that spans population-, community-, and ecosystem-level processes while keeping the research focused on ecological factors that directly or indirectly affect the size of a focal population. In the case of the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), which lives in mature pine forests of the southeastern United States, four types of environmental factors have been shown to limit its numbers, even on public land: (1) insufficient habitat due to hardwood midstory encroachment, (2) a shortage of suitable cavity trees, (3) loss and fragmentation of habitat, and (4) demographic isolation.
   As part of the research to identify other potentially limiting environmental factors in the Apalachicola National Forest of northern Florida, we studied a sample of 87 social units (each unit usually a mated pair of birds with or without helpers, but sometimes a single bird). Each unit was defending a cluster of cavity trees and a foraging territory of open longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. We then developed regression models for predicting within-population variation in the size, density, and productivity of social units from data on habitat variation. We found that variation in the bird variables was not significantly related to the sizes or densities of pine trees in these territories. It was, however, highly significantly related to the ground cover composition and the extent of natural pine regeneration, both of which are indirect indicators of local fire history. This suggests that, in addition to the four main causes, environmental processes driven by the history of fire are also limiting the Red-cockaded Woodpecker population. Additional support for this idea comes from the fact that female Red-cockaded Woodpeckers an the Apalachicola Ranger District tend to lay larger clutches of eggs in the first breeding season after their territories have been burned.
   Because fire history affects soil nutrient dynamics, which in turn affect ground cover composition, our present hypothesis is that nutrient dynamics are affecting the health of animal populations in the system, including that of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker. The path by which this process operates, the particular nutrients involved, and its importance relative to other factors that limit the population need to be addressed experimentally. If nutrient dynamics are a previously unrecognized limiting factor for animal populations in this ecosystem, then the role of fire is not restricted to its ability to reduce vegetation in the midstory, and managers should acknowledge that different regimes of prescribed fire are likely to have different effects on animal, as well as plant, populations.

AB  - Ocean-colour remote sensing provides high-resolution and global-coverage of chlorophyll concentration, which can be used to estimate ecological indicators and to study inter-annual and long-term trends in the state of the marine ecosystem. To date, the record of ocean-colour observations is a rich one, including data from a number of sensors spanning more than three decades. The ESA Ocean-Colour Climate Change Initiative has advanced seamless merging of ocean-colour observations from missions during the period 1990s to 2010s. However, comparison of these more recent observations with records from 1970s to 1980s remains a complex undertaking, particularly for absolute values of chlorophyll concentration, primarily due to differences in the sensors. A further impediment to the analysis of the past records is the non-uniform distribution of gaps in the observations, in both time and space dimensions, when data from two or more sensors are compared. Here, we use the CZCS gap distribution from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS, 1978-1986) as a mask to evaluate the impact that missing data may have on the estimation of six ecological indicators, when using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data set. Specifically, we evaluate the precision and accuracy of indicators by computing the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the bias arising purely from missing data. We develop an original resampling method allowing comparison of indicator estimates between SeaWiFS reference time-series and SeaWiFS time-series with CZCS-like gaps. We reduce some of the sampling gaps by applying a linear interpolation procedure, and compute multi-year averages of the indicators for every one-by-one degree pixel where sufficient data are available. Indicators from SeaWiFS reference and SeaWiFS with CZCS-like gaps are compared. Lowest uncertainty arising from missing data is observed in the indicators of annual mean and median chlorophyll concentration (global mean RMSE of 8% and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 1%), whilst higher uncertainty is recorded for the peak chlorophyll values and the duration of the phytoplankton growing period (global mean RMSE of 33 and 47% respectively and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 20%). Timing of initiation of the increasing phase of chlorophyll concentration in the seasonal cycle and timing of peak chlorophyll are subject to a global mean RMSE of nearly two months and a bias of two weeks or less. The present quantitative evaluation of uncertainty due to missing data demonstrates that, when pooled to create a nine-year climatology at 8-day temporal resolution, the coverage of CZCS is adequate for many climate-related studies on the marine ecosystem. Phytoplankton annual mean biomass can be estimated with low error in approximately 95% of the global oceans (i.e. regions where the indicators can be estimated with RMSE values of less than 30% and bias within 10%), and the phenological patterns can be estimated with low error in approximately 25% of the global oceans.

AB  - Molybdenum is an essential trace element for human, animal and plant health and has played an important part in the evolution of life on earth. Nonetheless, exposure to the element can be harmful and although the evidence for symptoms in humans is sparse, it has been linked with a number of health conditions in animal models. Molybdenum is present in trace quantities (1-10 mg/kg) in most rocks and soils and at concentrations less than, and often orders of magnitude less than, 10 mu g/L in most fresh-waters. It is the most abundant transition metal in open seawater (10 mu g Mo/L) owing to the dominance, and low chemical reactivity, of the molybdate ion (MoO42-).
   The 2011 WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality (fourth edition) advised a health-based value of 70 mu g/L. for Mo but this is no longer promulgated as a formal guideline value as WHO consider such concentrations to be rarely found in drinking water. This is indeed usually the case, but there are instances where currently-used drinking waters do exceed 70 mu g Mo/L. We therefore recommend more routine measurement of Mo in water, at least on a reconnaissance scale, in order to improve knowledge on occurrence in water used for potable supply. Where multi-element analytical procedures are already used (e.g. ICP-MS), the marginal cost of adding Mo to the list of elements to be analysed should not be great.
   We have reviewed nine areas in the world where high concentrations of Mo in freshwater, and in some cases drinking water, have been found: Argentina, Jordan, Qatar, Ethiopia, UK, USA (three) and Chile. These represent a range of geochemical environments. A common theme of the high-Mo occurrences is (i) oxic, alkaline conditions where, as for seawater, the Mo occurs as the stable molybdate ion; groundwater in oxic, alkaline conditions within volcanogenic sediments can have exceptionally high Mo concentrations (up to hundreds of mu g/L) where felsic volcanic ash is present; (ii) anoxic, non-sulphidic waters where Mo can be released to solution by reductive dissolution of Mn and Fe oxides or by release from degradation of organic matter, notably within high-Mo organic-rich muds, black shales or oil shales; or (iii) surface waters or groundwater impacted by metal sulphide mining and/or mineralisation, in particular occurrences of porphyry deposits. Under such conditions, Mo concentrations can reach several tens to several hundreds of mu g/L and while not all are otherwise suitable for drinking water, some are.
   Much of the basic geochemistry of Mo in oxic natural environments is now quite well understood. Critically, its behaviour is redox-sensitive like its near neighbours in the Periodic Table, W and V. At the near-neutral pH values characteristic of most natural waters, Mo is rather weakly sorbed and formation of Mo minerals is either not indicated or is extremely slow. Molybdenum becomes less mobile when converted to thiomolybdates under the strongly reducing conditions found in some present-day ocean basins (e.g. the Black Sea), fjords, stratified lakes and confined aquifers. This leads to concentrations of around 100 mg Mo/kg or more in black shales and other organic-rich mudstones. However, despite the many studies of these water bodies and the importance of Mo as a palaeoredox indicator, the mechanism of the highly-efficient and diagnostic scavenging of Mo in euxinic (H2S-rich) waters remains uncertain. Possibilities include the formation of an as yet unidentified Mo-Fe-S mineral or solid solution, or the scavenging by some pre-existing solid such as a sulphide or oxide mineral, or organic matter. The possible role of dispersed and reduced natural organic matter has become more prominent in recent years but this has proven difficult to quantify and the mechanism of binding is poorly understood. Molybdenum isotope studies now play an important role in constraining reaction pathways. At a more fundamental level, there is a lack of up-to-date thermodynamic and kinetic data for many of the reactions of importance for Mo in the natural environment and this limits the ability of current geochemical models to predict its fate and transport. This is particularly true for the strongly reducing conditions where Mo partitions to the solid phase, leading to the formation of the Mo-rich shales, Even the existence of reduced aqueous Mo species (e.g. in the Mo(V) and Mo(111) oxidation states) in natural waters is uncertain. These uncertainties will only be resolved with focused laboratory experiments using the benefits of modern instrumentation, combined where necessary with supporting molecular dynamics calculations.
   The mobility of Mo in aqueous systems has to date received far more attention in the marine than the freshwater setting, The value of Mo speciation as an indicator of redox conditions and of stable-isotopic variations as a tracer, can have more value in the arena of environment and health, and studies of the element's mobility in aqueous systems can be useful for themes varying from radioactive waste disposal, sustainability of unconventional hydrocarbon exploitation and wider surficial pollution.

AB  - Various benthic mapping methods exist but financing and technical capacity limit the choice of technology available to developing states to aid with natural resource management. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of using a single-beam echosounder (SBES), satellite images (GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2) and different image (pixel-based Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), and an object-based image analysis (OBIA)) and hydroacoustic classification and interpolation techniques, to map nearshore benthic features at the Bluefields Bay marine protected area in western Jamaica (13.82km(2) in size). A map with three benthic classes (submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), bare substrate, and coral reef) produced from a radiometrically corrected, deglinted and water column-corrected WorldView-2 image had a marginally higher accuracy (3%) than that of a map classified from a similarly corrected GeoEye-1 image. However, only one of the two extra WorldView-2 image bands (coastal) was used because the yellow band was completely attenuated at depths 3.7m. The coral reef class was completely misclassified by the MLC and had to be contextually edited. The contextually edited MLC map had a higher overall accuracy (OA) than the OBIA map (86.7% versus 80.4%) and maps that were not contextually edited. But, the OBIA map had a higher OA than a MLC map without edits. Maps produced from the images also had a higher accuracy than the SAV map created from the acoustic data (OAs >80% and kappa >0.67 versus 76.6% and kappa=0.32). SAV classification was comparable among the classified SBES SAV data points and all the final maps. The total area classified as SAV was marginally larger for satellite maps; however, the total area classified as bare substrate using the images was twice as large. A substrate map with three classes (silt, sand, and coral/hard bottom) produced from the SBES data using a random forest classifier and a Markov chain interpolator had a higher accuracy than a substrate map produced using a fractal dimension classifier and an indicator krig (the default choice) (72.4% versus 53.5%). The coral reef class from the SBES, OBIA, and contextually edited maps had comparable accuracies, but covered a much smaller area in the SBES maps because data points were lost during the interpolation process. The use of images was limited by turbidity levels and cloud cover and it yielded lower benthic detail. Despite these limitations, satellite image classification was the most efficacious method. If greater benthic detail is required, the SBES is more suitable or more effort is required during image classification. Also, the SBES can be operated in areas with turbid waters and greater depths. However, it could not be used in very shallow areas. Also, processing and interpolation of data points can result in a loss of resolution and introduces spatial uncertainty.

As a result of this review, we want to ask if there is enough evidence to propose the use of the term "mEMA" (mobile-based EMA).
   Design: A systematic review according to PRISMA Statement (PROSPERO registration: CRD42018088136).
   Method: Four databases (PsycINFO, CINALH, Medline and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched electronically from 2008 to February 2018.
   Results: A total of 76 studies from 297 potential articles on the use of EMA and PA were included in this review. It was found that 71% of studies specifically used "EMA" for assessing PA behaviors but the rest used other terminology that also adjusted to the inclusion criteria. Just over half (51.3%) of studies (39) used mHealth technology, mainly smartphones, for collecting EMA data. The majority (79.5%) of these studies (31 out of 39) were published during the last 4 years. On the other hand, 58.8% of studies that only used paper-and-pencil were published during the first 3 years of the 10-year period analyzed. An accelerometer was the main built-in sensor used for collecting PA behavior by means of mHealth (69%). Most of the studies were carried out on young-adult samples, with only three studies in older adults. Women were included in 60% of studies, and healthy people in 82%. The studies lasted between 1 and 7 days in 57.9%, and between three and seven assessments per day were carried out in 37%. The most popular topics evaluated together with PA were psychological state and social and environmental context.
   Conclusions: We have classified the EMA methodologies used for assessing PA behaviors. A total of 71% of studies used the term "EMA" and 51.3% used mHealth technology. Accelerometers have been the main built-in sensor used for collecting PA. The change of trend in the use of tools for EMA in PA coincides with the technological advances of the last decade due to the emergence of smartphones and mHealth technology. There is enough evidence to use the term mEMA when mHealth technology is being used for monitoring real-time lifestyle behaviors in natural situations. We define mEMA as the use of mobile computing and communication technologies for the EMA of health and lifestyle behaviors. It is clear that the use of mHealth is increasing, but there is still a lot to be gained from taking advantage of all the capabilities of this technology in order to apply EMA to PA behavior. Thus, mEMA methodology can help in the monitoring of healthy lifestyles under both subjective and objective perspectives. The tendency for future research should be the automatic recognition of the PA of the user without interrupting their behavior. The ecological information could be completed with voice messages, image captures or brief text selections on the touch screen made in real time, all managed through smartphone apps. This methodology could be extended when EMA combined with mHealth are used to evaluate other lifestyle behaviors.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the article is to form analytical tools for the capital reproduction in the agricultural sector of Ukraine's economy for substantiation of management decisions to ensure its continuous recovery, progressive growth of its value on the basis of positive qualitative changes in capital at its optimal structural proportions.
   Methodology / approach. Such scientific methods were used in the article to achieve the purpose of the research: structural and logical analysis - to form a holistic conceptual approach to research; comparison - to substantiate the peculiarities of the reproduction of capital at the macro level and in the agricultural sector of the economy; statistical method - for processing information that characterizes the value and structural proportions of capital of economic entities in the agricultural sector of the economy.
   Results. Elaboration of analytical indicators of the passive part of the balance of economic entities of agriculture, forestry, fisheries of Ukraine revealed that there is an increase of equity capital relative to its cost value, but a decrease in its share in the total capital structure, namely a decrease of cost estimate of equity capital relative to borrowed capital occurs 3.5 times more intensely; during 2010-2018, total capital, equity capital and gross value added of enterprises of the national economy of Ukraine, as well as the agricultural sector of the economy showed sustainable growth, but in the agricultural sector of the economy there was a decrease in the share of gross value added in total capital of enterprises that proved the tendency of potential narrowing the sources of ensuring the reproduction of capital; during the study period, the level of real capitalization in the agricultural sector of Ukraine's economy decreased significantly; dynamic changes in indicators of financial stability of agricultural enterprises confirmed that in 2018 agricultural enterprises were able to finance their assets at the expense of equity by only 49 % (in 2001 - 66 %), financial stability of agricultural enterprises in 2018 lagged behind the optimal allowable value by 12 percentage points, in contrast to 2001 (exceeding the optimal allowable value by 3 percentage points), which encouraged an increase of financial risks in agriculture.
   Originality / scientific novelty. Financial diagnostics of cost and structural characteristics of capital of economic entities in the agricultural sector of Ukraine's economy revealed that in the agricultural sector there is a paradoxical situation: the dynamics of retained earnings growth in the structure of equity capital, accompanied by declining dynamics of equity in the total amount of total capital and narrowing of cost estimates of equity in relation to GDP. It is proved that the formation of optimal proportions of capital is one of the factors ensuring expanded reproduction of capital, therefore, the mechanism of implementation of financial policy of capital reproduction should be aimed at increasing internal sources of capital formation and optimizing the structure of total capital. Given that the agricultural sector of Ukraine with its basic component, farming, is a system-forming component in the national economy and forms the basis for preserving the sovereignty of the state (food, economic, environmental and energy security within certain limits), we assume that further accumulation of negative trends from the perspective of values and structural proportions of capital in the agricultural sector of Ukraine's economy may be the basis for the acquisition of a state of financial fragility in the economic system as a whole.
   Practical value / implications. To harmonize certain norms of capital formation of Ukrainian enterprises, it is proposed to take into account the "fixed capital system", enshrined in the second EU Directive and to establish at the legislative level the procedure for capital formation for limited liability companies (LLCs): guaranteed real contribution of authorized capital should be at the level of the cost values of net assets of the company; to consider such level as the minimum admissible.

AB  - The paper presents the possibility of using quick field indexing methods for initial soil quality assessment in the areas of exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon origin from unconventional fields, including hydrocarbon from shale gas fields. As methods for the initial assessment of soil quality, methods such as pH measurement, conductivity, chloride ion measurement by Mohr method and measurement of hydrocarbon content by spectrophotometry were tested. These methods was selected to provide a good indicator of typical organic and inorganic soil contamination that may result from exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbon deposits. These methods, although known for a long time and to a large extent, were subjected to an optimization process with respect to primary methods. The optimization process was supposed to help increase the applicability of particular methods in field conditions and to shorten the time needed to implement them. For this reason, parameters such as the method and time of extraction of analytes and the necessity of drying the sample were included among the optimized parameters. At the end of the optimization process, each indicator method was subjected to a validation process to the extent necessary to evaluate whether the proposed method could be implemented in field trials. Validation parameters such as correctness, measuring range, precision, selectivity and elasticity of the method were validated and the linearity of the method was used in the case of the hydrocarbon indicator for the determination of hydrocarbon content by spectrophotometric method. Obtaining satisfactory results of validation of individual indicator methods made it possible to assure that the selected methods can be used for preliminary assessment of soil quality in exploration and exploitation areas of unconventional hydrocarbons. Full implementation for field application of indicator methods required, in addition to the optimization and validation processes, the designation of limit values which would indicate the presence of environmental polution in the area. The limit values for each of the four tested indicator methods are based on the information obtained from the validation process, the literature data on the variability of the individual soil parameters, the permitted content of the individual substances and the maximum content that does not adversely affect the functioning of the ecosystem. Exceeding certain limits not only indicate the potential for soil contamination in a given area, but also serve as an indication that soil quality tests conducted in a given area should be supplemented by detailed laboratory tests. Consequently, for each of the four indicator methods, supplementary laboratory tests were selected which should be performed after exceeding the established limit values for the different indicator methods. Laboratory tests are designed to confirm the presence of contamination and to accurately determine its nature. The developed indicator methods along with defined limit values and the scope of complementary laboratory tests provide a sufficient tool for rapid assessment of the state of the soil environment in the exploration and exploitation areas of unconventional hydrocarbons.

AB  - The subject of the author's research is the processes of development of the agrarian sector of Ukrainian economy by ecological-economic specifications. The methodological justification is based on the use of fundamental principles that reflect the main strategies of agrarian development. The systematic approach to the characteristics of the agrarian system, complex by the structure and functional parameters in interaction with the external environment, is applied. Methods of analysis/synthesis are used for the disclosure of the integral nature of the agrarian environment in the context of management of the main processes. The purpose of the author's research suggests a consideration of the processes of formation of the agrarian system by economic and environmental interactions as modern dominant in the development of the agrarian sector of Ukraine. The analysis of integral components of agrarian development with the reflection of interactions of the sphere of agrarian production and agrarian relations is carried out. The emphasis is made on the importance of the formation of an effective and promising domestic agricultural policy, in the basis of which is the activation of entrepreneurial initiatives, comprehensive development of the agrarian community, ecologically and socially oriented projects of reproduction of rural territories, innovative strategies of ecological and economic ascension of agriculture in Ukraine. The resource base is considered as the economic basis of agriculture from the standpoint of the main sales markets, the state of transport infrastructure, the growth of world and domestic demand for agrarian raw materials and finished products, and the availability of relatively cheap labour resources. The agrarian production is analysed from ecological positions and influences of natural and climatic factors.The state of individual agro-ecological mismatches in agriculture of Ukraine is explained, as well as the reasons of polluting impacts on the main natural spheres and some other unfavourable environmental actions. An attention is focused on the importance of reproduction of the Ukrainian agrarian sector on the basis of the adjustment of the system of state regulation and on the definition of the coordination mechanisms between the sphere of influence of the state and market elements of the national agrarian economy. The motivational goals, operating target facilities, main directions of administrative tasks for the development of the state regulation system based on economic and environmental criteria are substantiated. The importance of managerial approaches in the system of state regulation of the development of domestic agricultural production on the example of plant growing is specified.The dependency between the production of crops by gross collection, yield, and annual needs of the country are analysed, in particular, by the food and export potential of individual plant crops, etc. The analysis of the most important strategic positions for the development of the domestic agricultural sector in the system of state regulation of Ukraine for the near future is carried out. Corresponding conclusions to the author's research are made, reflecting the analysed specifications of development of the agrarian sector of Ukrainian economy by ecological and economic indicators. At the same time, modern for Ukraine approaches are proposed in the field of agricultural management, as well as new regulatory accents to stimulate agrarian development in specific areas.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to determine the number of segments of green consumer behavior on toiletries products, and the tendency of transition between clusters is estimated. This study also provides recommendations based on the results. Design/methodology/approach This study used primary data collected through an online and offline questionnaire. The questionnaire was intended to identify the socio-demographic characteristics, green consumer behavior state according to the environment as well as the willingness of the respondents to purchase various toiletries products (current, less green, and greener). Prior to segmenting green consumer behavior, scale purification using confirmatory factor analysis was performed to ensure the indicators used were valid. The k-means clustering algorithm was used for the segmentation, while discriminant analysis was used to validate the segmentation result. The Markov chain approach was performed to estimate the tendency of the transition between constructed segments, where the logistic regression model was applied to predict the individual transition probability. Findings The clustering algorithm resulted in three segments: light green, green and dark green. The light green segment has the lowest attitude toward the environmental criteria while the members of the dark green segment have the highest attitude among the other segments. The logistic regression indicated that the tendency of individuals to stay in the current segment or move to the adjacent segment was influenced by socio-demographic factors. The one-step transition probability matrix revealed that the tendency of a particular segment to move to the greener segment was greater than to stay or even move to the less green segment. The Markov chain approach then showed that the steady-state condition will emerge after 18 steps. Research limitations/implications This study was limited geographically and by the criteria used for segmenting the green consumer behavior; therefore, it is recommended that this study be replicated on a greater scale with more criteria. A wider geographic area could be considered, including a national study, and more criteria, such as social influences, could be considered. This study does not focus on specific toiletries products. Selecting more specific toiletries products could be considered to provide a more reliable response from the respondents. Moreover, factors around the willingness to pay for green products were not investigated in greater detail although these factors might become indicators that can distinguish between two or more segments. Practical implications This study empirically supports the theory that consumer environmentally friendly behavior can be used to appropriately categorize consumers into several segments, and thereby guide the development of a more differentiated policy approach for business and government. Social implications Green consumer behavior may help save the environment and it will be beneficial in reducing environmental damage. Originality/value The study extends the existing literature related to green consumer behavior by segmenting the green consumer behavior based on the environmental criteria and applying the Markov chain approach to estimate the tendency of transition between segments.

AB  - Background: Existing research indicates that spending time in nature is associated with diverse aspects of children's health and wellbeing. Although fundamental to later life chances and health, no systematic reviews, to our knowledge, have focused specifically on the effects of interaction with nature on socioemotional functioning in childhood.
   Objectives: Amongst children, what is the consistency of associations between the availability of or spending time in nature on socioemotional function and development? Furthermore, which child behaviours and states independently associate with socioemotional function and availability of or spending time in nature, and what is the consistency of associations between these behaviours and states and contact with nature?
   Data sources: Embase, Environment Complete, MEDLINE, and APA PsycINFO. Eligible studies were backward and forward snowball-searched.
   Study eligibility criteria: Studies investigating effects of, or associations between, availability of or interaction with nature on socioemotional or proximal outcomes in children under the age of 12 years were included in this review.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: The internal validity of studies investigating socioemotional outcomes were based on assessments of elements of study design, conduct, and reporting to identify potential issues related to confounding or other biases. The number of analyses indicating positive, negative, and non-significant associations between availability or interaction with green space and the outcomes were summed.
   Results: A total of 223 eligible full-texts, of which 43 pertained to socioemotional outcomes and 180 to proximal outcomes, met eligibility criteria. Positive associations between availability of and spending time in green space were found with children's intra- and interpersonal socioemotional function and development. Proportions of positive findings ranged from 13.9% to 55% across experimental and observational research, exposures, populations, and contexts. Modifying and mediating factors were identified. We found consistent evidence for improved aspects of cognition and, for children over six years, reduced risk of obesity and overweight in association with green space; consistent links between movement behaviours in the experimental, but not observational research; tentative trends suggesting associations with play, motor skills, language, screen time, and communication skills; little evidence for positive associations between green space and mood, physical wellbeing, and stress; some evidence for associations with healthy birth outcomes, and little evidence for direct associations between availability of green space and asthma and allergy prevalence, however, mediation via, for example, air pollution was likely. Limitations: We identified few studies without either probable or severe risk of bias in at least one item. Improved study quality may therefore result in different results. Restricting analyses to include only studies considered at low risk of bias indicated similar or slightly lower proportions of positive findings. Risk of bias in proximal outcomes was not assessed.
   Conclusions: The empirical evidence for benefits of availability of and interaction green space for child socioemotional function and development must currently be considered limited. A number of proximal indicators were identified.

AB  - Ukraine belongs to a group of countries in which political, grand, and petty corruption deeply rooted in various spheres of life and became an organic element of social relations. During 2014-2018, the fight against corruption in Ukraine was identified as one of the key priorities of the state policy. This was also noted by international organizations. The implemented reforms contributed to moving Ukraine from 144th place in 2013 to 130th place according to the Corruption Perception Index. The purpose of the article is determined as to study reforming of the institutional system of the fight against corruption in the context of European integration transformation directed to increasing transparency and openness of the state as an institute and improving the governance. Traditionally, three functional types of corruption are distinguished: political corruption, grand corruption, and petty corruption. The author presented a generalized group of indicators of measuring the efficiency of the fight against corruption, including: Group 1. Economic indicators: reduction of economic losses as a result of the elimination of specific corruption schemes and the elimination of conditions that give rise to corruption; Group 2. Indicators of the activity of the law-enforcement system: the number of persons brought to administrative and criminal responsibility for corruption violations and crimes; amounts of damages recovered; Group 3. Indicators of public acceptance of the effectiveness of counteraction to corruption: assessment of the dynamics of corruption in various dimensions by different social and professional groups. For successful application of the experience of EU countries when developing effective anti-corruption policy in Ukraine, it is necessary: firstly, determine and implement in Ukrainian legislation relevant international legal rules of state, regional, and local nature; secondly, given the successful experience of certain countries, identify a complex of most important for Ukraine factors aimed at providing effectiveness of state policy of preventing corruption, structure them based on principles of priority and the most functionality in order to create a model optimal for Ukrainian conditions; thirdly, develop and form for this model proper institutional support of regulatory character that would harmoniously combine state, regional, and local levels of public administration. The paper determines "direct" anti-corruption effects of corresponding changes in economic governance. It is obvious that direct effects can be levelled by corruption risks in related spheres. So, the delegation of certain powers and financial resources to the local level in the process of decentralization objectively restricts corruption in the relations of "centre-regions" in terms of the distribution and use of financial resources, however, without effective anti-corruption system at the local level, the anti-corruption effect of decentralization will be less than expected. In order to overcome mass violations of anti-corruption norms and rules, it is needed to implement a whole range of measures to criminalize corruption, that is, to establish criminal responsibility for corruption offenses and corruption-related offenses and create a law enforcement system capable of effectively counteracting the corruption actions that we have identified in the study.

AB  - India has a long-term program of wide spread applications of nuclear radiations and radioactive sources for peaceful applications in medicine, industry, agriculture and research and is already having several thousand places in the country where such sources are being routinely used. These places are mostly outside the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) installations. DAE supplies such sources. The most important application of nuclear energy in DAE is in electricity generation through nuclear power plants. Fourteen such plants are operating and many new plants are at various stages of construction.
   In view of the above mentioned wide spread applications, Indian parliament through an Act, called Atomic Energy Act, 1964 created an autonomous body called Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) with comprehensive authority and powers. This Board issues codes, guides, manuals, etc., to regulate such installations so as to ensure safe use of such sources and personnel engaged in such installations and environment receives radiation exposures within the upper bounds prescribed by them. Periodic reports are submitted to AERB to demonstrate compliance of its directives. Health, Safety and Environment Group of Bhabha Atomic Research Centres, Mumbai carries out necessary surveillance and monitoring of all installations of the DAE on a routine basis and also periodic inspections of other installations using radiation sources.
   Some of the nuclear fuel cycle plants like nuclear power plants and fuel reprocessing involve large radioactive source inventories and have potential of accidental release of radioactivity into the environment, an Environmental Surveillance Laboratory (ESL) is set up at each such site much before the facility goes into operation. These ESL's collect baseline data and monitor the environment throughout the life of the facilities including the decommissioning stage. The data is provided to AERB and is available to members of the public. In addition, a multi-tier system of AERB permissions is in place to ensure that all aspects of safety have been considered before permission to operate is granted. The stages where permission of AERB is essential are site selection, design data, and several stages during construction and operation. The details required by AERB include provision for treatment and storage of radioactive waste, de-commissioning procedures and provision of costs. In addition to AERB, nuclear power plants have to comply with the requirements of Ministry of Environment and Forests and get their clearance. This is given on the basis of Environmental Impact Assessment Report which should satisfy the authorities that no ecological damage will be caused and the facility will not have adverse effect on the environment. In addition, the State Pollution Control Board where the facility is to be located has to permit the site of the plant for its proposed discharges into the environment. It is largely due to the above comprehensive regulatory controls that none of the plants in India had any accident during the last 3-4 decades of operation. The type of measurements carried out by the ESL's and results from a few typical ESL's will be presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of competitiveness is increasingly to compare different economies at national and regional levels. It is a concept that firstly was applied at microeconomic level. However, its definition is not clear when it is applied to regions and countries. Therefore, its clarification is imperative in order to measure it at regional level and establish meaningful comparisons.
   One of the key approaches to the study of competitiveness is the World Economic Forum. This institution began developing the Global Competitiveness Index in 2004. Their methodology, with an important contribution of Sala i Martin and his team, is centered in identifying the pillars of competitiveness and the key variables in each of the pillar. Their aim is to obtain a more complete picture of the real development of the competitiveness of an economy, disaggregated into a comprehensive set of components that properly quantify this development. This makes it possible to know the situation and the evolution of global competitiveness.
   In this study the methodology is adapted for the 17 Spanish regions selecting 15 pillars: Business culture, Regional concentration/specialization, Internationalization, Innovation, Favorable industrial environment, Availability of capital, Institutional factors, Labor availability, Highly qualified workforce, Entrepreneurs and managers qualifications, Post-educational level, Knowledge infrastructures, Traditional basic infrastructures, Technological infrastructures and Region image.
   Business culture pillar consists of two basic indicators: the existence of barriers to entry and exit and the existence of risk culture. Each is analyzed through two variables. The existence of barriers to enter and exit is approximated by the tax burden on companies, which is a significant barrier to entry for companies and regulations. The second indicator is studied through two variables: the rate of entrepreneurial activity and the number of self-employed.
   Regional concentration/specialization is analyzed through four indicators: the concentration of production by sectors, the concentration of employment by sectors, the importance of high value-added activities, and the contribution of advanced services in the GDP.
   Internationalization is analyzed using three indicators: The share of exports in total regional GDP, the percentage of foreign direct investment in regional GDP and the new businesses created in the year divided into the population, as new firms tend to export a greater extent than older ones with the same size.
   Innovation is quantified through four indicators per population: registered patents, total expenditure on R&D, private spending on R&D, and expenditure on technological innovation.
   A favorable industrial environment allows the existence of a dynamic network of small and medium enterprises, as well as a low level of unemployment. To measure this pillar, the existence of SMEs is studied in two complementary ways; first the percentage of microSMEs (1 to 10 employees) and the percentage of medium-sized companies (50-250 employees). The first group has a size too small to optimize processes and thus must be considered a negative indicator of a favorable industrial environment, since in many cases they lack access to finance. By contrast, companies between 50 and 250 workers have a sufficient size to be able to export, improve the value chain, innovate and specialize. Additionally, the number of strikes and number of lost working days per year are studied.
   The availability of capital is measured through two variables: the savings as a percentage of regional GDP and the gross fixed capital formation in the region.
   Institutional factors are analyzed with three different variables: regional and local expenditure per capita, the crime rate, and cultural facilities such as the number of golf courses, cinemas and theaters per number of inhabitants.
   Labor availability is measured with the variation of the working population each year, the number of public vocational training centers, and the annual change in the number of foreign employees.
   Highly qualified labor force is studied with three indicators: The level of training of workers as the percentage of employed persons with secondary or tertiary education, the apparent labor productivity as the ratio of the regional GDP into the number of employees, and the number of university students as a percentage of the population.
   The pillar of qualification of entrepreneurs and manager is analyzed by two indicators: The level of professionalism and the level of efficiency. The first one can be measured by the percentage of entrepreneurs and managers of the total employees, while the ratio of GDP into the number of entrepreneurs and managers can be used to measure the level of efficiency.
   The post-educational level is studied through the analysis of two variables that provide insight into people who have completed non-compulsory education: the percentage of population with a university degree or a vocational training degree.
   The knowledge infrastructures included in the analysis are universities and R&D centers. They can be counted, but due to the great disparity in size is preferable to analyze homogeneous variables such as the spending on university education and number of full-time equivalent employees in R&D departments.
   Transport and communications infrastructures are essential for a competitive region. Kilometers of both roads and highways, airport activity (passenger traffic and freight transport) and the passenger numbers of middle-and long-distance trains are included in this pillar.
   Technological infrastructure is studied from the perspective of businesses and households through the calculation of the following indicators: percentage of companies with a website, companies using web-based services to communicate with public administrations, companies that sell their products or services on the internet and companies that have a local area network. Technological infrastructures of individuals and households are measured with the percentage of households with broadband internet access, percentage of the population who frequently use the internet, who contact electronically with public administrations and who buy often through websites.
   The last pillar is region image. Its focus is diverse in order to capture a number of very different dimensions. The indicators related to education are the number of students per teacher and the ratio of classrooms per student. The number of medium-sized cities, which according to the OECD definition correspond to municipalities between 100,000 to 250,000 inhabitants, is also an indicator of a good quality of life. Affordable housing price is also taken into account. It is measured by the number of real estate transactions divided by the population. In addition, natural conditions are a factor to consider, because more attractive regions typically have a higher number of hours of sunshine per year, more kilometers of coastline and lower annual rainfall. Finally, health related variables such as the number of hospitals, hospital beds and doctors per capita are computed in this pillar.
   Each of the pillars is included in one of the three environments that incorporate information about the level of competitiveness: productive environment (pillars 1 to 7), human capital environment (pillars 8 to 11) and public capital environment (pillars 12 to 15). In each pillar there are a set of variables that allow measuring the annual value of the pillar index. These indexes take values between zero and one. A higher value represents a higher level of competitiveness. With the averages of the pillar indexes we compute the indexes of the three environments. In turn, the aggregate index of regional competitiveness is the average of the three indexes of the environments.
   In a second stage, we perform a factor analysis in order to arrive to the improved index of regional competitiveness. This new index does not present important differences with respect to the order of regions. We also develop a cluster analysis to identify the groups of regions according to their competitiveness level.
   In the period 2001-2014 there are no significant changes in the index of competitiveness for any region. Therefore, Madrid is the most competitive region in all the years analyzed. The Basque Country, Navarra and Catalonia are also competitive regions and their high competitiveness level is similar. Aragon and La Rioja have less competitiveness but are in a better position than the group that includes most of the Spanish regions. Finally, the three least competitive regions are Canarias, Castile la-Mancha and Extremadura.

AB  - The pleasant sensation experienced when, for example eating or having sex is regulated by the motivation-rewarding system. This rewarding sensation makes the subject to repeat the behavior in order to obtain the reinforcer once more. This system can be corrupted by drugs of abuse by triggering an intense feeling of pleasure and inducing plastic changes. In normal conditions, a natural reinforcer is a stimulus generating a benefit to the organism. For example, food will provide energy and structure among many other benefits. Sex, in turn, accomplishes the function of giving new beings to the species and to create boundaries between subjects to generate groups and culture. Due to these facts, it is crucial to reinforce this kind of behaviors. They are crucial for the subject's life. In contrast, drugs do not produce any benefit to the subject or group. Although in ancient times human beings used drugs as a means to develop and practice their mysticism, such practice is no longer associated with the use of drugs. With the exception of present time aboriginal communities, none of the regular users in our countries consume drugs with ritual-mystical purposes. Hence, we have to accept that drugs are of no use for human beings. They do not help us as species to have more adapted, intelligent or developed subjects in our communities. However, their ability to stimulate the rewarding system makes them popular and dangerous to the individual's health and life.
   The motivation-rewarding system is regulated by numerous neurotransmitters, among them dopamine, that is released in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and synthesized by the neurons located in the ventral tegmetal area (VTA). There are other substances that modulate the activity of the dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, such as serotonin, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. The activation of the VTA and its consequent activation of the NAc enhance the release of neuromodulators such as endorphins and endocannabinoids, thus generating the subjective sensation of pleasure. All these interactions trigger the activity of memory systems generating a memory trace encoding the characteristics of the substance or behavior causing pleasure. This occurs in the context that the brain accepts these substances or behaviors as beneficial to the organism.
   The punishment system is also a very important system working in tight communication with the pleasure system. Fear is one of the most critical adapting behaviors for any subject in the animal kingdom. Fear helps us to avoid dangerous stimulus and behaviors.
   There is also pleasure involved in escaping this kind of situations. It seems like there is an interaction between the motivation-rewarding and the punishment systems. As a result, there is a balance at times in favor of pleasure, at times in favor of punishment depending on the quality of the stimulus. This balance gives the valence to the emotion triggered by the stimulus. A stimulus with a positive valence will increase the probability of exhibiting the behavior displayed to obtain it, while a stimulus with a negative valence will increase the probability of exhibiting the behavior displayed to avoid it.
   In this context, the so-called non-natural reinforcers such as drugs of abuse act directly on the pleasure system. For example, nicotine acts on the nicotinic receptor of ACh, alcohol, on the receptor of GABAa and glutamate (NMDA), marihuana on the endocannabinoid receptor (CBIR), located in the motivation-rewarding system triggering an "intense sensation of pleasures". However, two main shortcomings make drugs of abuse dangerous: first, their effect is short and, second, they do not convey any beneficial effect to the organism whatsoever. Brain mechanisms not very well defined detect this lack of benefit; hence, the motivation-rewarding system reduces its response by means of at least two plastic changes, reducing the availability of receptors (epigenetic changes induced by the drug) and by increasing the activity of the punishment system to maintain the balance. As a result, the subject does not experience the same pleasure with the same dose of the drug. In the clinic we call this phenomenon tolerance. If the individual insists in pursuing the same intensity of pleasure, he/she has to consume more of the drug, forcing the brain to strengthen its plastic changes. In this context, we can say that these systems are defending themselves against the action of the drug. Then, why do subjects insist in pursuing the effect of drugs? Very likely because the substrate of the subject's disorder resides anywhere in the brain but in the pleasure system. If so, this indicates that drug addiction is a disorder caused by another disease, very likely a psychiatric one.
   Several factors contribute to generate drug addiction, i. e. social, psychological and genetic. Genes contribute in different ways to generate the subject's vulnerability to suffer an addiction. A gene mutation (alteration in genetic information) or a given polymorphism (the existence of multiple alleles of a gene in a population) can produce a dysfunctional protein or alter its normal levels. Such changes may make some individuals vulnerable to the initial use of drugs of abuse. However, those genes facilitating adjustments in the motivation-rewarding system that occur after the repeated consumption of drugs of abuse seem to be functioning normally, as we can infer from the development of tolerance.
   The heritability of these genes, making subjects vulnerable to addiction, has been studied in many ways, including studies of families, adoptees, and twins (monozygotic and dizygotic). From these studies it has been possible to calculate the heritability index, a measure which indicates how much variance of a trait in a specific sample is associated to genetic factors and how much to the environment. The heritability index has a range from 1, meaning the maximum genetic influence, to 0, meaning the maximum environment influence. At present, a significant number of genes have been involved in facilitating addiction to drugs, and also very important, to the response to treatment for rehabilitation.
   The expression of the genes is regulated by a series of processes called epigenesis. Epigenetic changes can be a result of the interaction between genes and environment. This interaction results in chemical processes that modify chromatin structure. For example, cytosine nucleotide methylation causes chromatin condensation, which interferes with gene transcription; hence, the protein encoded by this gene will be reduced, and the function in which it participates will be altered. As an example, when the methylation of the gene encoding for the glucocorticoid receptor occurs in rats, it reduces the bioavailability of this receptor and increases the release of corticosterone when rats are stressed. At the behavioral level, rats seem to be more stressed most of the time as compared with rats without methylation of this gene.
   Almost every stimulus in the environment is a potential promoter of epigenesis. Epigenesis is important to occur, since it is an adaptive response of the organism to the environment. It seems like the switches of the genes are turned on or off according to environment circumstances. These genetic changes will be ultimately expressed as plastic changes pursuing the right adaptation of the subject to the environment. Parental care seems to be one crucial contributor to these epigenetic modifications. For example, when a mother-rat provides poor care (feeding, grooming, and physical contact) to its litter during the neonate period, facilitates the methylation of genes, as it has been proved for the glucocorticoid receptor. These changes generate subjects with poor stress management and less capability for learning. Likewise, it makes them susceptible to drug addiction. These results highlight the importance of parental care as provider of a healthy environment, which is modeling the expression of their genes, hence their behavior.
   In this review we are discussing the interaction between genes and environment and the function of the brain to generate drug addiction. Although not exhaustive, this review pursues to discuss relevant and state-of-the art information to help the reader to understand those mechanisms subserving this debilitating disease.

AB  - Author summaryWhy was this study done? The approval of new pharmaceutical products addressing an unmet need or of public interest may be speeded up if medicines regulators agree to assess them through expedited assessment pathways. Pharmaceutical product development may be speeded up by using surrogate (substitute) endpoints (for example, based on a blood test or a radiological change) to measure benefit in the pivotal (main) trials assessed by regulators rather than waiting on the intended clinical outcome (benefits in how patients feel, function, or how long they survive). It is not known how often regulatory approval is based on a surrogate endpoint instead of a clinical outcome. It is not known how accurately the surrogate endpoints used in pivotal trials correspond to improvement in clinical outcomes. What did the researchers do and find? We examined endpoints supporting regulatory approval of products assessed through 2 expedited assessment pathways, conditional marketing authorisation (CMA; 26 products) and accelerated assessment (AA; 25 products) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) between 2011 and 2018. Where surrogate endpoints were used, we searched the academic literature for studies demonstrating that the surrogate reliably reflected a clinical outcome. Most of the expedited approvals studied (46/51; 90%) were based on surrogate endpoints, and none of these has (yet) been shown to reliably predict clinical outcomes. The information provided by the regulator for prescribers and patients did not consistently explain that the approval for the product was based on trials that reported surrogate endpoints rather than clinical outcomes. What do these findings mean? For the majority of the products studied, we do not know whether they will provide their intended clinical benefit for patients. When nonvalidated surrogate endpoints are used in pivotal trials, a requirement for additional studies confirming the clinical benefit to patients needs to be imposed by the regulator on the manufacturing authorisation holder responsible for the product. It would be of great help for patients and doctors if the product information provided by the regulator clearly stated whether surrogate endpoints or actual clinical outcomes were reported in the pivotal trial/s for the product, the validity of a surrogate endpoint (when used) as a reflection of the intended clinical outcome, and whether follow-up studies demonstrating clinical benefit were required for products approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints in the pivotal trials. A limitation of our study is that it applies to products approved through 2 expedited pathways; we do not know to what extent other types of regulatory approval are based on surrogate endpoints.
   Background In situations of unmet medical need or in the interests of public health, expedited approval pathways, including conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) and accelerated assessment (AA), speed up European Medicines Agency (EMA) marketing authorisation recommendations for medicinal products. CMAs are based on incomplete benefit-risk assessment data and authorisation remains conditional until regulator-imposed confirmatory postmarketing measures are fulfilled. For products undergoing AA, complete safety and efficacy data should be available, and postauthorisation measures may include only standard requirements of risk management and pharmacovigilance plans. In the pivotal trials supporting products assessed by expedited pathways, surrogate endpoints reduce drug development time compared with waiting for the intended clinical outcomes. Whether surrogate endpoints supporting products authorised through CMA and AA pathways reliably predict clinical benefits of therapy has not been studied systematically. Our objectives were to determine the extent to which surrogate endpoints are used and to assess whether their validity had been confirmed according to published hierarchies. Methods and findings We used European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) to identify the primary endpoints in the pivotal trials supporting products authorised through CMA or AA pathways during January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2018. We excluded products that were vaccines, topical, reversal, or bleeding prophylactic agents or withdrawn within the study time frame. Where pivotal trials reported surrogate endpoints, we conducted PubMed searches for evidence of validity for predicting clinical outcomes. We used 2 published hierarchies to assess validity level. Surrogates with randomised controlled trials supporting the surrogate-clinical outcome relationship were rated as 'validated'. Fifty-one products met the inclusion criteria; 26 underwent CMAs, and 25 underwent AAs. Overall, 26 products were for oncology indications, 10 for infections, 8 for genetic disorders, and 7 for other systems disorders. Five products (10%), all AAs, were authorised based on pivotal trials reporting clinical outcomes, and 46 (90%) were authorised based on surrogate endpoints. No studies were identified that validated the surrogate endpoints. Among a total of 49 products with surrogate endpoints reported, most were rated according to the published hierarchies as being 'reasonably likely' (n = 30; 61%) or of having 'biological plausibility' (n = 46; 94%) to predict clinical outcomes. EPARs did not consistently explain the nature of the pivotal trial endpoints supporting authorisations, whether surrogate endpoints were validated or not, or describe the endpoints to be reported in the confirmatory postmarketing studies. Our study has limitations: we may have overlooked relevant validation studies; the findings apply to 2 expedited pathways and may not be generalisable to products authorised through the standard assessment pathway. Conclusions The pivotal trial evidence supporting marketing authorisations for products granted CMA or AA was based dominantly on nonvalidated surrogate endpoints. EPARs and summary product characteristic documents, including patient information leaflets, need to state consistently the nature and limitations of endpoints in pivotal trials supporting expedited authorisations so that prescribers and patients appreciate shortcomings in the evidence about actual clinical benefit.
   For products supported by nonvalidated surrogate endpoints, postauthorisation measures to confirm clinical benefit need to be imposed by the regulator on the marketing authorisation holders.

AB  - Environmental monitoring of pollutants in international or local programmes has enabled authorities to evaluate the success of political measures over time. Strict environmental legislation and the introduction of cleaner technologies have already led to significant improvements of the air and water quality in many countries. Still, the discharge and deposition of anthropogenic long-range transported pollutants often remain above the critical thresholds and long-term targets defined for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems even in EU countries. In order to determine the spatial and temporal variation of pollutant and nutrient loads in different environmental media a unique ecological response cadastre (A-kologisches Wirkungskataster, A-KWI) was set up in the Land of Baden-Wurttemberg (SW Germany) in the mid 1980s. As a part of the program a state-wide bioindicator network was established in 64 forest and 18 permanent grassland ecosystems, in which selected chemical elements were measured over time. Here, we report on the results of these analyses and discuss the general spatio-temporal trends in pollution loads.
   Sixty-four forest and 18 permanent grassland plots were established in state-owned forest and nature conservation areas of SW Germany representing different landscapes and geologies of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg. Apart from performing vegetation relev,es in marked plots of either the grassland or forest sites, plant samples were collected in intervals of 2 to 3 years following a standardised protocol. To be able to compare the different monitoring sites, four common species were chosen as indicator species in the grasslands. Later on, also bulk grassland samples were taken regardless of the species. In the forests, foliage of the dominant tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Abiea alba or Fraxinus excelsior) was sampled in the crown of marked trees and from the same species in the herb layer. The elements analysed in the plant material were the essential plant nutrients C, N, S, P, Ca, K and Mg and the metals Mn, Cd, Pb, Al, Cu, Ni and Hg. Data were analysed using descriptive and multivariate statistics and maps were produced to identify regional differences in pollutant deposition.
   Out of the elements analysed, lead and sulphur concentrations showed the most pronounced downward trends over time in tree foliage and grassland samples with the largest decreases observed in the early 1990s. Both the reduced lead and sulphur levels in the biomonitors reflect the successful implementation of clean air policies, i.e. the introduction of unleaded gasoline, the availability of desulphurisation technologies and the economic transition of Eastern European heavy industries. However, the decrease in sulphur concentrations was lower in beech foliage from SW Germany as compared to beech leaves from six German national parks suggesting regional differences in sulphur deposition and trends thereof. At the same time, sulphur concentrations declined more strongly in the grassland samples indicating that much of the deposited sulphur remains in the forest ecosystems while in the grassland ecosystems it is gradually removed by the frequent cutting and grazing. During the time series, the decrease in sulphur deposition coincided with a marked increase in rain pH. At the same time, the increasing nitrogen concentrations observed over time in beech leaves suggest that emissions of oxidised and reduced nitrogen are still adding to the large-scale eutrophication of SW German forests. However, N concentrations in both the tree foliage and in the bulk grassland samples were unrelated to the modelled N deposition. When also considering macronutrient concentrations and N:P and N:K ratios, the results point to serious nutrient imbalances in many beech forests, which may reduce plant vitality and tree growth in the long run.
   Biological monitoring using plants is an effective tool to address changes in the environmental quality over time and space. The success of European clean air policies and the introduction of emission reduction technologies could be mirrored by the declining sulphur and lead concentrations in the present and in other monitoring programmes. However, the changed deposition patterns, i.e. lower deposition of acids and higher deposition of reactive nitrogen, are coupled to changes in the soil chemistry and will continue to affect plant nutrition and the uptake of elements in the future.
   Although it could be shown that deposition of sulphur and lead has declined markedly in the past 20 years, biomonitoring is still necessary to reveal changes in element concentrations and nutrient imbalances. The use of plants as bioindicators should be continued as an integral part of environmental monitoring programmes. Besides the chemical analyses, also biometric parameters, e.g. thousand needle or leaf weights, biomass production in grassland plots and stem increments in forest plots, should be included to monitor the long-term responses of European ecosystems to environmental and climatic changes.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Exergy has been put forward as an indicator for the energetic quality of resources. The exergy of a resource accounts for the minimal work necessary to form the resource or for the maximally obtainable amount of work when bringing the resource's components to their most common state in the natural environment. Exergy measures are traditionally applied to assess energy efficiency, regarding the exergy losses in a process system. However, the measure can be utilised as an indicator of resource quality demand when considering the specific resources that contain the exergy. Such an exergy measure indicates the required resources and assesses the total exergy removal from nature in order to provide a product, process or service. In the current work, the exergy concept is combined with a large number of life cycle inventory datasets available with ecoinvent data v1.2. The goal was, first, to provide an additional impact category indicator to Life-Cycle Assessment practitioners. Second, this work aims at making a large source of exergy scores available to scientific communities that apply exergy as a primary indicator for energy efficiency and resource quality demand.
   Methods. The indicator Cumulative Exergy Demand (CExD) is introduced to depict total exergy removal from nature to provide a product, summing up the exergy of all resources required. CExD assesses the quality of energy demand and includes the exergy of energy carriers as well as of non-energetic materials. In the current paper, the exergy concept was applied to the resources contained in the ecoinvent database, considering chemical, kinetic, hydro-potential, nuclear, solar-radiative and thermal exergies. The impact category indicator is grouped into the eight resource categories fossil, nuclear, hydropower, biomass, other renewables, water, minerals, and metals. Exergy characterization factors for 112 different resources were included in the calculations.
   Results. CExD was calculated for 2630 ecoinvent product and process systems. The results are presented as average values and for 26 specific groups containing 1197 products, processes and infrastructure units. Depending on the process/product group considered, energetic resources make up between 9% and 100% of the total CExD, with an average contribution of 88%. The exergy of water contributes on the average to 8%, the total exergy demand, but to more than 90% in specific process groups. The average contribution of minerals and metal ores is 4%, but shows an average value as high as 38% and 13%, in metallic products and in building materials, respectively. Looking at individual processes, the contribution of the resource categories varies substantially from these average product group values. In comparison to Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and the abiotic-resource-depletion category of CML 2001 (CML'01), non-energetic resources tend to be weighted more strongly by the CExD method.
   Discussion. Energy and matter used in a society are not destroyed but only transformed. What is consumed and eventually depleted is usable energy and usable matter. Exergy is a measure of such useful energy. Therefore, CExD is a suitable energy based indicator for the quality of resources that are removed from nature. Similar to CED, CExD assesses energy use, but regards the quality of the energy and incorporates non-energetic materials like minerals and metals. However, it: can be observed for non-renewable energy-intensive products that CExD is very similar to CED. Since CExD considers energetic and non-energetic resources on the basis of exhaustible exergy, the measure is comparable to resource indicators like the resource use category of Eco-indicator 99 and the resource depletion category of CML 2001. An advantage of CExD in comparison to these methods is that exergy is an inherent property of the resource. Therefore less assumptions and subjective choices need to be made in setting up characterization factors. However, CExD does not cover societal demand (distinguishing between basic demand and luxury), availability or scarcity of the resource. As a consequence of the different weighting approach, CExD may differ considerably from the resource category indicators in Eco-indicator 99 and CML 2001.
   Conclusions. The current work shows that the exergy concept can be operationalised in product life cycle assessments. CExD is a suitable indicator to assess energy and resource demand. Due to the consideration of the quality of energy and the integration of non-energetic resources, CExD is a more comprehensive indicator than the widely used CED. All of the eight CExD categories proposed are significant contributors to Cumulative Exergy Demand in at least one of the product groups analysed. In product or service assessments and comparative assertions, a careful and concious selection of the appropriate CExD-categories is required based on the energy and resource quality demand concept to be expressed by CExD.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. A differentiation between the exergy of fossil, nuclear, hydro-potential, biomass, other renewables, water and mineral/metal resources is recommended in order to obtain a more detailed picture of resource quality demand and to recognise trade-offs between resource use, for instance energetic and non-energetic raw materials, or nonrenewable and renewable energies.

TI  - Institutional framework in the period before Slovakia's European Union accession
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA  - Slovak
AB  - Adequate institutional structure is a precondition for EU membership. As the reference date for accession is 2004, all relevant acquis should be implemented until the end of this year and so is expected adequate strengthening of capacities. In the accession process framework are specified another priorities (e.g. harmonization of legal system), measures for implementation and conditions for providing support. However, adaptation depends also on transparency of decision-making, law enforcement and elimination of corruption. Reform of public administration, made through decentralization, is based on operation of state administration and regional self-government and on changing competencies with the aim to reduce expenditures and improve services. Respected in this process are principles of subsidiarity and competitive environment.
   In general, there has been a strengthening of the system of governmental management bodies like, e.g., Custom directorate of the Slovak republic. In the case of public finance the gradual reductions of subsidies is the basic principle to be followed in the next future and market functioning should be improved via financial control over enterprises. Economic policy priorities have shifted from liberalization and privatization towards structural changes in corporate law. The amendment should increase transparency of ownership and business relations and, therefore, lead to a better corporate governance. Mentioned briefly are survey results on increasing ownership concentration of the biggest shareholders. Among central issues is also formation of competitive environment. Following acts on state assistance and on protection of economic competition, expected is approval of legal regulations allowing to provide group exceptions from prohibition of agreements limiting competition for certain agreements.
   Despite the fact that, as mentioned above, the state enforces liberal model of the economy based on transparency of business environment it also aims to develop some industries or branches to make Slovak industrial structure more similar to that of EU countries. Such changes should lead towards higher intra-industry trade, a feature typical for developed economics. Accepted concept of state science and technology policy, supporting participation in EU framework programs, faces problem with inadequate funding.
   In corporate law an amended bankruptcy act has enforced position of creditors which should speed-up corporate restructuring and recovery. Being aware of the positive role of foreign investment, the state promotes their inflows using certain policy measures like tax holiday etc. As a potential positive by-product of ending privatization is considered the possibility that completion of privatization could eliminate chances for corruption in state administration.
   Some changes have indirect impact on corporate costs or production. Poorly performing healthcare sector increases illness rates of workforce and problems in education sector negatively affects qualification of labor force. It is necessary, according to policymakers, to reform social system by changing the system of pension and social insurance and social aid. Reform of healthcare should guarantee transition towards predominantly ambulant form of care and decentralization of the whole system. Elementary healthcare insurance should be extended by supplementary insurance and optional commercial insurance schemes.
   In environmental protection the main principles are those related to sustainable development. National environmental action program SR II has originated and the realization of this policy is conditioned by introduction of environmental taxes, management and audit. Projected are also monitoring and information systems. Key role in the process of EU programs and implemented should be the administrative structure at NUTS 11 level. Improvement of technical preparation of projects financed from EU structural funds is needed.
   In the area of free movement of goods it is necessary implement operational directives related to technical requirements for products. Act oil public procurement has already been implemented to a substantial degree acquis but real use has remained a problem. Legal changes should be followed by building of administrative capacities. One example is the need for coordination of the control of adjustment process in the area of Slovak technical norms in non-harmonized area.
   As general requirement, it is necessary to implement numerous laws in individual chapters in the whole EU directives agenda. Labor Code and laws oil state and public services, in the chapter of social policy and employment, were implemented recently but the remaining problem is flexibility, of labor market. Approval of the law oil network industries regulation, creation of regulatory office and removal of price distortions had prepared conditions for successful restructuring of energy industry. Passed was the law on emergency petrol reserves and petrol products and amended was the law oil state tangible reserves. Enforced will be the capacity of the Off ice for regulation of network industries due to the preparation of secondary legislature in this area. In a preliminary concluded chapter Protection of consumer and health remaining directives should be implemented, c. g., marking of consumer products with price tags.. and legislature regulating market supervision. Passed was also a custom act. full harmonized should be the scheme of General systcru of preferences (until 2004) and passcd should be all act on Export-import Bank of the SR. In preparatory stage is a new information society strategy.
   Progress in transposition of accession chapters is the subject of EC evaluations. Report on Preparedness (2001) positively evaluates number of measures already made. It states that progress has been reached in the areas of structure and functioning of administration, justice, legislature of internal market, corporate law and competition. Progress has to be made in agriculture sector and in enforcing of administrative capacities (e. g., management and control of EC funds). Improvement has been expected especially in the area of corporate law, competition, social policy and employment. Comparison of candidate countries made on the basis,of convergence indicator DCEI (DGZ Deka Bank) shows that the Slovak republic still lacks behind other candidate partners. However, in the area of institutional convergence is its evaluation better than is the total country rating. Evaluations have informative purpose only but for accession decisions one should look also oil non-economic (political and strategic) dimensions.

AB  - The concept of ecological integrity has been applied widely to management of aquatic systems, but still is considered by many to be too vague and difficult to quantify to be useful for managing terrestrial systems, particularly across broad areas. Extensive public lands in the western United States are managed for diverse uses such as timber harvest, livestock grazing, energy development, and wildlife conservation, some of which may degrade ecological integrity. We propose a method for assessing ecological integrity on multiple-use lands that identifies the components of integrity and levels in the ecological hierarchy where the assessment will focus, and considers existing policies and management objectives. Both natural reference and societally desired environmental conditions are relevant comparison points. We applied the method to evaluate the ecological integrity of shrublands in Nevada, yielding an assessment based on six indicators of ecosystem structure, function, and composition, including resource- and stressor-based indicators measured at multiple scales. Results varied spatially and among indicators. Invasive plant cover and surface development were highest in shrublands in northwest and southeast Nevada. Departure from reference conditions of shrubland area, composition, patch size, and connectivity was highest in central and northern Nevada. Results may inform efforts to control invasive species and restore shrublands on federal lands in Nevada. We suggest that ecological integrity assessments for multiple-use lands be grounded in existing policies and monitoring programs, incorporate resource- and stressor-based metrics, rely on publicly available data collected at multiple spatial scales, and quantify both natural reference and societally desired resource conditions.

AB  - Identification of rapid degradation of ecological resources requires effective environmental monitoring including ecological integrity assessment Our first aim is to analyze ecological integrity in a landscape context while developing a method to assess integrity in spite of a dearth of historical data. We used a Spatial-Temporal Reference Framework for land cover maps for assessing ecological integrity change, emphasizing changes in patch types and configuration. Land cover is used as a surrogate for habitat. Habitat condition is the main point of this research in assessing ecological integrity. Our second aim is to recognize, through a case study of the above, the ecological integrity of the Miankale peninsula of Miankale Biosphere Reserve on Iran's Caspian Sea coast in the east latitude of 53 degrees,24 degrees '50 degrees and north altitude of 36 degrees,56 degrees,45 degrees Land cover data were obtained from Landsat TM5 of 1985 and compared with current condition images from Landsat TM5 of 2010. Landscape metrics show that Minakale's natural semi-dense shrub lands are fragmented; with the number of patches increasing and average patch area decreasing. This implies a fall in habitat available to its dependent bird species. In conclusion, considering birds' habitat and its aggregation as a measure of integrity, landscape metrics show ecological integrity of Miankale has decreased and signals of habitat loss hate appeared in study area. More detailed analysis in ecosystem scale is suggested as the complementary research to find the best indicator for assessing the integrity of the ecosystem.

AB  - Large floodplain rivers (LFRs) are currently threatened by high levels of human alteration, and utilization is expected to grow. Assessments to determine ecological condition should address the specific environmental features of these unique ecosystems, while conservation management requires balancing maintenance of good ecological condition with the ecosystem services provided by LFRs. However, a systematic evaluation of the scientific literature on assessment of ecological condition of LFRs and trade-offs to guide conservation management is currently lacking. Here, we reviewed 153 peer reviewed scientific articles to characterize methodological patterns and trends and identify knowledge gaps in the assessment of LFRs. Our review revealed that most approaches used classical biotic indices for assessing ecological condition of LFRs. However, the number of articles specifically addressing the peculiarities of LFRs was low. Many studies used watershed level surveys and assessed samples from small streams to large rivers using the same methodological protocol. Most studies evaluated the status of main stem river habitats only, indicating large knowledge gaps with respect to the diversity of river-floodplain habitat types or lateral connectivity. Studies related to management were oriented toward specific rehabilitation actions rather than broader conservation of LFRs. Papers relating to ecosystem services of LFRs were especially few. Most importantly, these studies did not distinguish the different functional units of river-floodplain habitat types (e.g. eupotamon, parapotamon) and their role in ecosystem services provision. Overall, the number of articles was too low for meaningful analyses of the relationships and tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation, maintaining ecological condition, and use of ecosystem services in LFRs. Our review highlights research gaps and emphasizes the importance of developing more holistic indicators of ecosystem condition, which better reflect landscape level changes in structure and functioning of LFRs. As human use of water and land increases, the need to develop more effective spatial conservation prioritization tools becomes more important. Empirical research in this field can aid in solving conflicts between socio-economic demands for ecosystem services and nature conservation of LFRs.

AB  - Validation of two indices of biological integrity (IBI) for the Angulo River subbasin in Central Mexico. Efforts to halt freshwater ecosystem degradation in central Mexico can benefit from using bio-monitoring tools that reflect the condition of their biotic integrity. We analyzed the applicability of two fish-based indices of biotic integrity using data from lotic and lentic systems in the Angulo River subbasin (Lerma-Chapala basin). Both independent data from our own collections during two consecutive years, and existing information detailing the ecological attributes of each species, were used to calculate indices of biological integrity for 16 sites in lotic and lentic habitats. We assessed environmental quality by combining independent evaluations water and habitat quality for each site. We found sites with poor, regular and good biotic integrity. Our study did not find sites with good environmental quality. Fish-based IBI scores were strongly and significantly correlated with scores from independent environmental assessment techniques. IBI scores were adequate at representing environmental conditions in most study sites. These results expand the area where a lotic system fish-based IBI can be used, and constitute an initial validation of a lentic system fish-based IBI. Our results suggest that these bio-monitoring tools can be used in future conservation efforts in freshwater ecosystems in the Middle Lerma Basin. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (4): 1669-1685.

AB  - Ecological integrity is a functional property that integrates habitat functions and species information for maintaining key ecological interactions in predator-prey systems. As a functional property, ecological integrity can be modeled as a latent concept from observable spatial attributes that measure the ecosystem's capacity to provide suitable habitat conditions for apex predators. Ecological integrity is a tri-dimensional concept that stems from "stable", "concurrent" and "intact" conditions. A theoretical framework and a methodology is presented here for modeling ecological integrity from observable attributes (as GIS layers) to obtain a spatial representation of the integrity condition. From a theoretical framework, the ecological integrity concept is obtained with a structural equation modeling approach, where several other latent variables are obtained for characterizing a hierarchical network of spatial information. Later on, these observable attributes, and several latent modeled variables are translated into sources of geographic information that can be used to monitor changes in the natural remnant areas due to human impacts. When examining the direct, indirect and total effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on ecological integrity, spatial intactness (e.g., the amount of remnant habitat and connectivity) and stability (resistance in the interaction network and mobile links) are the attributes more affected by the pathway effects. The balance of the formative parameters obtained for the model supports the idea that ecosystems that have a high degree of integrity should maintain a high level of stability, self organization and naturalness. These attributes are achieved when spatial habitat intactness and species interactions are maintained.

This review synthesizes recent advances in the field around a framework for environmental assessment and management that can guide design of assessments, applications of phycology in assessments, and refinements of those applications to better support management decisions. Algae are critical parts of aquatic ecosystems that power food webs and biogeochemical cycling. Algae are also major sources of problems that threaten many ecosystems goods and services when abundances of nuisance and toxic taxa are high. Thus, algae can be used to indicate ecosystem goods and services, which complements how algal indicators are also used to assess levels of contaminants and habitat alterations (stressors). Understanding environmental managers' use of algal ecology, taxonomy, and physiology can guide our research and improve its application. Environmental assessments involve characterizing ecological condition and diagnosing causes and threats to ecosystems goods and services. Recent advances in characterizing condition include site-specific models that account for natural variability among habitats to better estimate effects of humans. Relationships between algal assemblages and stressors caused by humans help diagnose stressors and establish targets for protection and restoration. Many algal responses to stressors have thresholds that are particularly important for developing stakeholder consensus for stressor management targets. Future research on the regional-scale resilience of algal assemblages, the ecosystem goods and services they provide, and methods for monitoring and forecasting change will improve water resource management.

AB  - During the last decade, there have been substantial scientific advances in the development of indices that measure the condition of biological ecosystem elements in coastal and estuarine waters. Though successful, these advances were only the initial steps and a special session on use of indices in ecological integrity assessments was held at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation meeting to focus the field on the most appropriate directions for the next decade. The session identified four primary scientific challenges: (i) reduce the array of indices by identifying the index approaches that are most widely successful; (ii) establish minimum criteria for index validation; (iii) intercalibrate methods to achieve uniform assessment scales across geographies and habitats; and (iv) integrate indices across ecosystem elements. Where an explosion of indices characterized the last decade, the next decade needs to be characterized by consolidation. With increased knowledge and understanding about the strengths and weaknesses of competing index approaches, the field needs to unify approaches that provide managers with the simple answers they need to use ecological condition information effectively and efficiently.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment and risk management call for "state-of-the-science" methods and sound scientific assessments of ecosystem health and stressor effects. In this paper recent developments of periphyton indicators of biotic integrity and ecosystem stressors of streams and wetlands are related in a framework of ecological metrics that can be used to quantify risk assessment and risk management options. Many periphyton metrics have been employed in past assessments of water quality and a periphyton indices of bionic integrity has been applied by the state of Kentucky. In addition, the sensitivity of species composition of periphytic diatom assemblages has been shown to respond predictably to ecological stressors so that specific pH, conductivity, and total phosphorus in wetlands and streams can be inferred with weighted average indices. Inference of nutrient conditions by diatom indicators of total phosphorus is shown to have: sufficient precision to be a valuable complement to one-time measurement of highly variable total phosphorus in streams. Quantitative indices of sustainability and restorability of ecosystem integrity are proposed, respectively, as the changes in ecological conditions that can occur without significant change in ecological integrity or changes that are necessary to restore ecological integrity.

AB  - We developed and evaluated a multimetric index of lake diatom condition (LDCI) based on surface-sediment samples for the National Lake Assessment (NLA) by the US Environmental Protection Agency. We selected final metrics in each of 5 categories for use in composite metrics of biological condition, which we combined in a hierarchical multimetric index. The final metrics selected for the LDCI had responses as predicted based on ecological principles, wide ranges, high signal-to-noise ratios, the ability to distinguish reference from disturbed lakes, and low intercorrelation. The final metrics were: Shannon diversity, taxon richness, % reference taxa, % tolerant taxa, % epiphytic individuals, % chain-forming individuals, % low-P taxa, % low-N taxa, % high-P taxa, % high-N taxa, % Achnanthidium individuals, % Cocconeis individuals, and % Cyclotella + Stephanodiscus individuals. We developed and tested models for adjusting the expected reference LDCI at a site for natural variation among sites. The best model used lake morphology, watershed attributes, and climate variables to predict expected reference LDCI for each lake. The adjusted LDCI was the observed LDCI at a lake minus the expected reference LDCI modeled for that lake. The adjusted LDCI varied less among reference sites than the LDCI, indicating the adjusted LDCI better accounted for natural variability among sites than the LDCI. However, it had less power than the LDCI to separate reference and disturbed lakes, a result attributed to lower values of expected reference LDCI in landscapes with high agricultural land use. The adjusted LDCI is the first multimetric diatom index developed for lakes, applied at a scale as large and diverse as the USA, and corrected for natural variation among lakes. According to the adjusted LDCI, 47.1% of USA lakes were in reference condition, 27.0% were in fair condition, and 23.2% were in poor condition.

AB  - Fish assemblage indicators developed throughout the world were reviewed and key differences in methodologies depending on ecoregions, basins and contrasting fish fauna summarised. Common elements of existing Indices of Integrity were identified to support the development of a European-wide fish index. These include, using reference condition, accounting for natural fish assemblage variability, evaluating metric precision and selecting the most sensitive and complementary metrics. For future developments, it was recommended to pay more attention to temporal variability in fish assemblages, age structure of key (sentinel) species and fish migration. Testing hypotheses at different steps of the process seems to be the appropriate way to design fish indices.

AB  - "Ecological integrity" provides a useful framework for ecologically based monitoring and can provide valuable information for assessing ecosystem condition and management effectiveness. Building on the related concepts of biological integrity and ecological health, ecological integrity is a measure of the composition, structure, and function of an ecosystem in relation to the system's natural or historical range of variation, as well as perturbations caused by natural or anthropogenic agents of change. We have developed a protocol to evaluate the ecological integrity of temperate zone, forested ecosystems, based on long-term monitoring data. To do so, we identified metrics of status and trend in structure, composition, and function of forests impacted by multiple agents of change. We used data, models, and the scientific literature to interpret and report integrity using "stoplight" symbology, ie "Good" (green), "Caution" (yellow), or "Significant Concern" (red). Preliminary data indicate that forested ecosystems in Acadia National Park have retained ecological integrity across a variety of metrics, but that some aspects of soil chemistry and stand structure indicate potential problems. This protocol was developed for the National Park Service Vital Signs Monitoring Program and holds promise for application in the temperate zone, forested ecosystems of eastern North America.

AB  - The landscape within the Chesapeake Bay watershed has been and continues to be impacted by human modifications. Understanding if such anthropogenic disturbances influence organisms that are dependent upon estuarine wetlands remains unclear. We developed an index of marsh bird community integrity (IMBCI) to evaluate marsh bird communities and wetland condition. During the 2002 and 2003 summers, we detected 30 bird species at 219 point count locations distributed among 96 wetlands. lMBCI scores for each wetland were used to determine whether wetland habitat characteristics and urban/suburban development, agriculture, and forest at three different spatial scales (watershed, 1000-m buffer, and 500-m buffer) influenced marsh bird community integrity. We found no relationship between lMBCI scores and wetland habitat characteristics, implying that marsh bird community integrity is not related to any single plant community. Nonparametric changepoint analysis indicated that marsh bird community integrity was significantly reduced when the amount of urban/suburban development within 500 m and 1000 m of the marsh exceeded 14% and 25%, respectively. There was no effect of urban/suburban development on lMBCI scores at the watershed scale. The results of our study demonstrate that marsh bird community integrity shows a threshold response to urban/suburban development at local scales. lMBCI scores, combined with the identification of a land-use threshold, can be easy to interpret and may help communicate complex ecological data to natural resource managers and conservation planners.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMIs) are common tools used to assess the biological status of ecosystems. However, not all the components of biological integrity have been equally addressed, since most of MMIs do not consider nonnative species, which are a great threat to ecosystems integrity. We performed a systematic review of how nonnative species have been considered in MMIs to assess biological conditions worldwide. Using a systematic review of the literature we identified to what extent nonnative species have been included as a disturbance factor for determining reference conditions and if specific metrics related to both nonnative and native species have been taken into account in the MMIs around the world. We also identified the most frequent species origin metrics that have been included in the MMIs. We searched for articles published in English up to 2016 that applied or developed an MMI in the Web of Science database (Clarivate Analytics). Following the PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 409 articles. We found that only 1.2% of the studies used nonnative species as a disturbance factor in determining reference conditions. About 66% of articles did not test or did not provide the information if they tested metrics on native or nonnative species. Most of the articles (53%) that tested native or nonnative metrics were fish-based MMIs. We found 97 different metrics, of which 69% were related to native species, whereas 31% were related to nonnative ones. Native richness was the most used metric in studies that considered species origin (23.5%). Our main results evidence that nonnative species are overlooked in biomonitoring programs. Owing to the well-known impacts of them on ecosystem integrity, their inclusion in definition of reference conditions and in MMIs metrics should be considered as bioassessment criteria.

AB  - The efficacy of assessments that evaluate biological integrity can be improved by accounting for the ecological processes that influence assemblage composition. Many studies have emphasized that bioassessments need to account for natural environmental gradients, but there is little consensus on how bioassessments should account for the impacts of non-native species. In particular, non-native trout species have been introduced into many high-quality streams that probably meet the expected reference conditions for bioassessment in a given region. The goal of this study was to test whether the presence of large, piscivorous, non-native Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) at reference sites altered interpretations of taxonomic completeness indices (TCIs) based on fish assemblages. We used fish data from 215 sites in wadeable streams in northwestern Pennsylvania to compare the performance of 3 TCIs that used different modeling approaches to account for Brown Trout impacts. One model accounted for the presence of non-native Brown Trout as a covariate (covariate model), another model censored reference sites with non-native Brown Trout from the reference pool (censored model), and a final model used all reference sites without accounting for the presence of Brown Trout (unaccounted model). TCIs based on observed-to-expected ratios were able to distinguish reference conditions from altered conditions in the covariate and censored models. In contrast, the unaccounted index could not distinguish reference from altered conditions and was, thus, unable to accurately assess biological integrity, probably because large Brown Trout reduce native species richness. Our results provide a framework for how bioassessment practitioners can use different approaches to account for non-native species impacts, especially when considering which criteria are most important for defining reference conditions. Accounting for the effects of non-native species with these approaches should improve the ability of bioassessments designed to summarize the interactive effects of all potential human stressors on stream assemblages.

AB  - BackgroundThis paper presents several spatial indicators developed to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on predator-prey interactions and their relationship with ecological integrity loss in Mexico. Ecological integrity loss is defined as the inability to sustain viable populations, habitat functions, and species interactions of Nearctic and Neotropical apex predators as a result of anthropogenic effects. As direct impacts, the indicators evaluate habitat loss and the number of inhospitable habitats. As indirect impacts, the indicators evaluate the avoidance of human features such as highways, roads, and human locations. The total impact level is described at 1km(2) resolution, and registered within the domain defined by the spatial habitat requirements of apex predators. The impact level is associated with ecological integrity loss, or the ecosystem capacity to reorganize habitat functions and sustain predator-prey interactions as the most visible elements of ecological integrity. Ecological integrity loss is evaluated for different groups of apex predators that are classified with different levels of anthropogenic threat.ResultsThe framework presented here identifies the spatial information needed for the assessment of cumulative anthropogenic impacts. By characterizing their distribution range, Nearctic predators have significantly larger intact habitats than neotropical predators but with higher ecological degradation, less landscape transformation, and overall less ecological integrity. As observed within their distribution areas, indirect impacts have a generalized effect in the broad range of landscapes in Mexico. Ecological integrity loss is the result of road, highway, and human settlement avoidance; but landscape transformation and human activity control the threshold for which ecological integrity loss becomes critical. On the other hand, there are no significant differences in impact levels among threat conservation categories for apex predators, which indicate that all predator species have the same threat level and should be all included in protection efforts.ConclusionsWith the application of this spatial framework, the significance, scale, and baseline conditions can be established for evaluating anthropogenic impacts on ecological integrity. The analysis of the current condition shows the status for apex predator in the country, and identifies the ecological integrity threshold when human activities have severe to highly severe impacts in the landscape, threatening the viability of populations and their habitat.

AB  - The concept of ecological integrity has become a worldwide phenomenon and is firmly entrenched into the regulatory structure of environmental law in the United States of America (USA). The attainment of ecological integrity requires the attainment of its three elements: physical, chemical, and biological integrity. In the USA, measures of chemical integrity were implemented first into monitoring programs and were effective in reducing pollutant loadings to the nation's surface waters. Because biological communities integrate the effects of different stressors such as reduced oxygen, excess nutrients, toxic chemicals, increased temperature, excessive sediment loading, and habitat degradation, the advent of bioassessment in regulatory programs has provided a more comprehensive and effective monitoring and assessment strategy. Measures of biological integrity clearly have become a priority in the USA. The development of biological criteria (biocriteria) within regulatory programs to serve as thresholds by which to judge the attainment of designated aquatic life conditions of surface waters is a major focus of states and Indian tribes within the USA. The derivation of reference conditions for the nation's surface waters (i.e., streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and marine waters) across different physiographic regions is a critical element in the design of biocriteria and is currently a primary initiative in the USA. Nearly all state water resource agencies have developed bioassessment approaches for streams; 1600 to 75 000 km of streams require assessment in each state. Bioassessment development for other water body types is not as advanced to date. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has produced technical guidance for developing effective bioassessment programs; they include crucial elements such as defining objectives, classifying water bodies according to expected biological attributes, deriving the reference condition of the site classes, developing standardized protocols for sampling and data analysis, and implementing a quality assurance plan. Approaches to bioassessment in the USA follow a basic design of incorporating various attributes of the elements and processes of the aquatic community, which is either an aggregation into a multimetric index or a series of multivariate analyses using the attributes as input variables. The Clean Water Act of 1972 and its subsequent amendments mandate maintaining, restoring, and protecting the ecological integrity of surface waters. Through use of robust bioassessments and other measures of ecological integrity, the USA has developed a strategic plan to establish priorities to meet this goal.

AB  - Assessment of ecological integrity is the basis for sustainable management of the ecosystem services lakes provide. Periphyton is used in stream assessment, but lake assessment is based mostly on water-column variables. We addressed the use of periphyton to assess lakes, how factors influence responses of periphyton metrics, and whether periphyton provides unique information for determining biological condition and identifying risks. Much effort directed at using periphyton for assessment has focused on linear relationships between taxonomic metrics and single stressors. These relationships can be good proxies for water chemistry, but do not always represent biological conditions. Community diversity is difficult to relate to stressors because low values may result from natural conditions (grazing, disturbance). Quantile regression, River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS)-type models, and taxonomic distinctiveness may provide more precise indicators. Periphyton biomass and productivity are linked closely to trophic status but are rarely used in assessment. Responses of these variables over a trophic gradient are often nonlinear, and surrogate metrics that use quantile regression or weighted-averaging calibration/regression based on community composition may overcome this problem for assessment. Measures, such as alkaline phosphatase activity, number of N-fixing taxa, and periphyton nutrient stoichiometry can be used to assess littoral-zone ecosystem function and to help establish causative effects of stressors. The value added by periphyton-based assessment is that it provides higher-level understanding of the ecological status of the littoral zone. Assessment must be rooted in a strong understanding of the science and must provide guidance and cost-effective options for lake managers. We outline a hierarchy for periphyton assessment methods that assess risk at different levels of effort and precision.

AB  - Human actions often alter natural environments, causing homogenization of micro-habitats and, consequently, the loss or replacement of species. Our research evaluates how the effects of environmental integrity and the physical and chemical characteristics of streams influence the adult Odonata community in a region of the Amazon, in western Para. The data were obtained in 15 streams of first and second order in the municipality of Santarem, Para, between October and December 2014 (dry season) and between March and May 2015 (rainy season). A total of 544 specimens were collected, distributed in 23 genera, 35 species. Significant differences were observed in the composition of Odonata based on the integrity of streams, and species are replaced as the habitat integrity gradient is reduced, with species that need more preserved conditions extinct locally, making room for generalist species. However, only Psaironeura tenuissima was an indicator of more preserved sites, while Argia sp.1 and Mnesarete smaragdina were indicative of altered sites. None of the variables had any influence on the richness or abundance of Odonata.

AB  - We review critical issues that must be considered when selecting indicator species for a monitoring program that aims to maintain or restore ecological integrity. First, we examine the pros and cons of different management approaches on which a conservation program can be based and conclude that ecosystem management is most appropriate. We then identify potential indicators of ecological integrity at various levels of the ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on the species level. We conclude that, although the use of indicator species remains contentious, it can be useful if (1) many species representing various taxa and life histories are included in the monitoring program, (2) their selection is primarily based on a sound quantitative database from the focal region, and (3) caution is applied when interpreting their population trends to distinguish actual signals from variations that may be unrelated to the deterioration of ecological integrity. Finally, we present and discuss different methods that have been used to select indicator species.

AB  - Evaluating landscape change requires the integration of the social and natural sciences. The social sciences contribute to articulating societal values that govern landscape change, while the natural sciences contribute to understanding the biophysical processes that are influenced by human activity and result in ecological change. Building upon Aldo Leopold's criteria for landscape health, the roles of societal values and biophysical processes in shaping the landscape are explored. A framework is developed for indicators of landscape health and integrity. Indicators of integrity are useful in measuring biological condition relative to the condition in landscapes largely unaffected by human activity, while indicators of health are useful in evaluating changes in highly modified landscapes.
   Integrating societal goals and biophysical processes requires identification of ecological services to be sustained within a given landscape. It also requires the proper choice of temporal and spatial scales. Societal values are based upon inter-generational concerns at regional scales (e.g. soil and ground water quality). Assessing the health and integrity of the environment at the landscape scale over a period of decades best integrates societal values with underlying biophysical processes.
   These principles are illustrated in two contrasting case studies: (1) the South Platte River study demonstrates the role of complex biophysical processes acting at a distance; and (2) the Kissimmee River study illustrates the critical importance of social, cultural and economic concerns in the design of remedial action plans. In both studies, however interactions between the social and the biophysical governed the landscape outcomes. The legacy of evolution and the legacy of culture requires integration for the purpose of effectively coping with environmental change. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - We describe the development of the first fish-based, multimetric indices for assessing and monitoring the health of Australian estuaries, and their application to the nearshore (<2 m depth) and offshore (>2 m depth) waters of the Swan Estuary, Western Australia. Suites of fish community metrics, including measures of species composition, diversity and abundance, trophic structure and life history function, were selected via a novel weight of evidence approach on the basis of their sensitivity to detect inter-annual change in estuarine condition. For each selected metric, seasonally-adjusted reference conditions were established for each spatial management zone of the Swan Estuary using 30 years of standardised historical fish assemblage data. This extensive data set provided a sound basis for deter-mining the 'best available' standard of biotic integrity recorded over that time period and thus a reliable benchmark against which the current and future health of the estuary may be assessed and compared. The nearshore and offshore indices were robust to the effects of natural, intra-seasonal variability in environmental conditions, and so provide reliable tools for quantifying and classifying the ecological health of the Swan Estuary and its constituent management zones. The response of the nearshore index to an algal bloom confirmed that it is sufficiently sensitive to quantify ecological health responses to local-scale environmental perturbations and to track the subsequent recovery of the system following their removal. The indices provide managers with a reliable, quantitative method for assessing and communicating the health of the Swan Estuary and, similarly, of other estuaries across south-western Australia.

AB  - The development of a multi-metric fish index, the Estuarine Fish Community Index (EFCI), for assessing estuarine environments is described. The index comprises 14 metrics or measures that represent four broad fish community attributes: species diversity and composition, species abundance, nursery function and trophic integrity. The individual metrics were evaluated using data that were collected on a South African estuary that was degraded and in which rehabilitation measures were implemented. The evaluation suggested that the selected metrics adequately measure the condition of separate but related components of estuarine fish communities and that these reflect environmental condition. Reference conditions and metric thresholds were derived from fish community data collected during an extensive national study. The final multimetric index was then constructed and evaluated. The EFCI combines both structural and functional attributes of estuarine fish communities and integrates these to provide both a robust and sensitive method for assessing the ecological condition of estuarine systems. It is also an effective communication tool for converting ecological information into an easily understood format for managers, policy makers and the general public.

AB  - The importance of establishing the ecological quality of estuarine systems has been widely acknowledged and led to the development of several fish community-based multimetric indices. Nevertheless, a question rose about the accuracy of these tools when natural disturbance is acting upon the organization of the systems' communities. Four multimetric indices were used to examine their ability to differentiate the ecological status of five small estuarine systems (southern Portugal), and also to test if they reflected the level of anthropogenic pressures. Fish assemblages from Mira, Odeceixe and Aljezur (in the Southwest coast), Gilao and Bensafrim (in the South coast) estuaries were sampled seasonally for one year, and anthropogenic sources of pressure were identified and quantified. We found that although the applied indices provided information on ecological condition differentiation among systems, they are unable to explain different classes of ecological status in systems with equivalent pressure levels.

AB  - To meet the objective of protecting water quality standards outlined in the US Clean Water Act, many agencies and organizations have created standardized biological assessment methods to evaluate aquatic ecosystem integrity. However, few Mid-Atlantic states have assessment methods specifically designed for rivers with drainage areas 2600km(2). Most rivers in this region fall into a semiwadeable category, where both wadeable and nonwadeable biological collection methods are difficult to implement. Additionally, these rivers often transcend state boundaries, which hinder consistent assessment determinations between states. Consequently, we developed a benthic macroinvertebrate assessment tool using a modified wadeable collection method for large semiwadeable rivers that can be used across state lines. Our results indicate that the two multimetric indices we developed (summer and autumn) are uniquely effective at distinguishing between least disturbed and stressed environmental conditions.

AB  - Freshwater is a basic need for the mankind. Effective biological tools (ecologically based, efficient, rapid and consistently applicable to different ecological regions) are needed to measure the "health" of rivers. Adapting such tools over a broad geographic area requires a detailed understanding of both the patterns of organisms assemblage composition and distribution within and among water bodies under natural conditions, and the nature of the major environmental gradients that cause or explain these patterns. A comprehensive review of the available litterature dealing with the identification of environmental factors structuring riverine fish assemblages under natural conditions permits to identify the most consistent ones.

AB  - 1. River-floodplain systems are among the most diverse and complex ecosystems. The lack of detailed information about functional relationships and processes at the landscape and catchment scale currently hampers assessment of their ecological status.
   2. Intensive use and alteration of riverine landscapes by humans have led to severe degradation of river-floodplain systems, especially in highly industrialised countries. Recent water-related regulations and legislation focussing on high standards of ecological integrity back efforts to restore or rehabilitate these systems.
   3. Most restoration projects in the past have suffered from a range of deficits, which pertain to project design, the planning process, the integration of associated disciplines, scaling issues and monitoring.
   4. The so-called 'Leitbild' (i.e. a target vision) assumes a key role in river restoration and the assessment of ecological integrity in general. The development of such a Leitbild requires a multistep approach. Including explicitly the first step that defines the natural, type-specific reference condition (i.e. a visionary as opposed to an operational Leitbild), has great practical advantages for restoration efforts, primarily because it provides an objective benchmark, as is required by the European Water Framework Directive and other legal documents.
   5. Clearly defined assessment criteria are crucial for evaluating ecological integrity, especially in the pre- and postrestoration monitoring phases. Criteria that reflect processes and functions should play a primary role in future assessments, so as to preserve and restore functional integrity as a fundamental component of ecological integrity.
   6. Case studies on the Kissimmee River (U.S.A.), the Rhine River (Netherlands and Germany), and the Drau River (Austria) are used to illustrate the fundamental principles underlying successful restoration projects of river-floodplain systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the fluorescence of Astyanax lacustris fish scales when excited in the UV-A and blue regions for use as a bioindicator of aquatic ecosystems. This species was firstly defined as Astyanax altiparanae, popularly known as "lambari-do-rabo-amarelo". Currently, abiotic/biotic environmental integrity is generally assessed using limnological and physicochemical parameters related to biological indicators in streams or rivers, which are not sufficient to evaluate the real environmental conditions: in some cases, these parameters can be strongly dependent on local weather conditions. In this study, after the fish scales were excited with UV-A (360 nm) and blue (405 nm) photons, a strong and broad visible fluorescence band (from blue to red) could be observed that was mainly related to collagen and hydroxyapatite, independent of whether the excitation was applied to the inside or outside of the scale. Selected emission wavelengths were used as variables and the fluorescence intensities were interpreted using multivariate discriminant statistical analysis to compare streams with known different levels of integrity. The fluorescence data showed strong correlation with the electrical conductivity of the water, indicating that the scales of A. lacustris could be employed as bioindicators of environmental integrity on water chemistry monitoring programs.

AB  - The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires European states to maintain their marine waters in 'Good Environmental Status'. The MSFD includes 11 descriptors of "Good Environmental Status" (GES), including "Sea-floor Integrity". This descriptor is defined as: "Sea-floor integrity is at a level that ensures that the structure and functions of the ecosystems are safeguarded and benthic ecosystems, in particular, are not adversely affected."
   This contribution briefly summarizes the main conclusions of an international expert group established to review the scientific basis for making this concept operational. The experts concluded that consideration of 8 attributes of the seabed system would provide adequate information to meet requirements of the MSFD: (i) substratum, (ii) bioengineers, (iii) oxygen concentration, (iv) contaminants and hazardous substances, (v) species composition, (vi) size distribution, (vii) trophodynamics and (viii) energy flow and life history traits. The experts further concluded that "Good Environmental Status" cannot be defined exclusively as "pristine Environmental Status", but rather status when impacts of all uses were sustainable. Uses are sustainable if two conditions are met:
   the pressures associated with those uses do not hinder the ecosystem components to retain their natural diversity, productivity and dynamic ecological processes
   recovery from perturbations such that the attributes lie within their range of historical natural variation must be rapid and secure.
   No single specific suite of indicators is proposed, both because no single set of indicators will meet the needs of all EU countries in all regional seas, and because according to the MSFD indicator selection is the prerogative of individual states. However, the need for conceptual consistency in assessing GES throughout European seas should be served if the selection of indicators and the integration of their information content in assessing GES follow the guidance in the report of the TG on Seafloor Integrity. This guidance is presented here in summary form.
   Informed by this report European Commission selected as indicators for the Sea-floor Integrity: (i) type, abundance, biomass and areal extent of relevant biogenic substrate; (ii) extent of the seabed significantly affected by human activities for the different substrate types; (iii) presence of particularly sensitive and/or tolerant species; (iv) multi-metric indices assessing benthic community condition and functionality, such as species diversity and richness, proportion of opportunistic to sensitive species; (v) proportion of biomass or number of individuals in the macrobenthos above some specified length/size; and (vi) parameters describing the characteristics (shape, slope and intercept) of the size spectrum of the benthic community.

AB  - Ecological integrity of managed forests includes the ability of an ecosystem to support a community of organisms with a similar species composition and functional organization as found in nearby natural systems. We developed an indicator system for ecological integrity based on simulated natural disturbance and indicator species to test if forest condition and habitat in managed forests are similar to that found or expected in natural systems. We then applied the method in an area of the boreal forest (Ontario, Canada) where the objective of Ontario's strategic forest management planning approach is, in part, to conserve ecological integrity through the emulation of the natural disturbance process. Forest condition controls the supply of habitat to support the diversity of native organisms, and historically in boreal forests the natural disturbance process drove forest condition. We selected indicators of forest condition (landscape pattern and compositional mosaic) and habitat function (occupancy rates for a broad range of forest birds), and applied our assessment system to test whether indicators of forest condition and habitat function reflect outcomes expected if natural disturbance processes were successfully emulated. We collected occupancy data in natural and managed forest disturbance types using autonomous acoustic recorders, applied occupancy/detection modeling to estimate corrected occupancy rates (Psi), and then tested for differences in Psi between disturbance types. Some indicators of forest condition were within the range expected under natural disturbance, but we found relatively less old conifer, more young deciduous and greater edge density in managed forests relative to forests of natural disturbance origin. Most species (11 of 14) occurred with equal Psi in habitat originating from the two disturbance types. Brown creeper (Certhia americana), bay-breasted warbler (Mniotilta varia) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) differed between disturbance types. Brown creeper uses older conifer and occurred at lower rates in managed forest, while red-eyed vireo uses a range of deciduous forest ages, and occurred at higher rates in managed forest. Differences in quantity and/or quality of specific habitat types likely explain the responses. The results suggest what directional changes in the forest pattern and compositional mosaic would improve ecological similarity with natural systems, but also indicate what further research is required. We believe this approach to assessing ecological integrity can be adapted to study the effectiveness of conservation management strategies in other systems, and will contribute to adaptive management approaches and evidence-based policy development.

AB  - A multimetric fish index, the Estuarine Fish Community Index (EFCI) of Harrison and Whitfield (2004), was applied to data collected for 190 South African estuaries. Estuaries spanned three biogeographic regions and included three distinct estuarine typologies. The EFCI is based on 14 metrics or measures that represent four broad fish community attributes: species diversity and composition, species abundance, nursery function, and trophic integrity. Metric reference conditions and scoring criteria were developed separately for each estuary type within each zoogeographic region. The final EFCI was applied to each estuary by comparing its fish community with the appropriate reference. Index values ranged between 18 (very poor) and 66 (very good). A comparison of the EFCI with independent measures of estuarine condition revealed that the index was able to effectively differentiate between poor and good quality sites. Applying the EFCI to estuaries in which multiple samples were taken also showed that the index is reproducible. The EFCI is both a robust and sensitive method for assessing the ecological condition of estuarine systems; it is also an effective communication tool for converting ecological information into an easily understood format for managers, policy makers, and the general public.

AB  - The integrity of wetlands is of global concern. A common approach to evaluating ecological integrity involves bioassessment procedures that quantify the degree to which communities deviate from historical norms. While helpful, bioassessment provides little information about how altered conditions connect to community response. More detailed information is needed for conservation and restoration. We have illustrated an approach to addressing this challenge using structural equation modeling (SEM) and long-term monitoring data from Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP). Wetlands in RMNP are threatened by a complex history of anthropogenic disturbance including direct alteration of hydrologic regimes; elimination of elk, wolves, and grizzly bears; reintroduction of elk (absent their primary predators); and the extirpation of beaver. More recently, nonnative moose were introduced to the region and have expanded into the park. Bioassessment suggests that up to half of the park's wetlands are not in reference condition. We developed and evaluated a general hypothesis about how human alterations influence wetland integrity and then develop a specific model using RMNP wetlands. Bioassessment revealed three bioindicators that appear to be highly sensitive to human disturbance (HD): (1) conservatism, (2) degree of invasion, and (3) cover of native forbs. SEM analyses suggest several ways human activities have impacted wetland integrity and the landscape of RMNP. First, degradation is highest where the combined effects of all types of direct HD have been the greatest (i.e., there is a general, overall effect). Second, specific HDs appear to create a "mixed-bag" of complex indirect effects, including reduced invasion and increased conservatism, but also reduced native forb cover. Some of these effects are associated with alterations to hydrologic regimes, while others are associated with altered shrub production. Third, landscape features created by historical beaver activity continue to influence wetland integrity years after beavers have abandoned sites via persistent landforms and reduced biomass of tall shrubs. Our model provides a system-level perspective on wetland integrity and provides a context for future evaluations and investigations. It also suggests scientifically supported natural resource management strategies that can assist in the National Park Service mission of maintaining or, when indicated, restoring ecological integrity "unimpaired for future generations."

AB  - Managing parks within an urban and urbanizing landscape context is the new normal for the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The NPS Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) program is tasked with collecting data on the natural resource condition of all 270 parks in the NPS system deemed to have significant natural resources. Synthesizing this large amount of diverse data into comprehensive assessments of ecosystem integrity has proven to be a daunting task. We provide an analysis of NPS I&M data for ten national parks located along an urban-rural gradient from Washington, DC to the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Mid-Atlantic, USA. Twelve representative metrics of ecosystem condition were selected and combined into single park scores using four separate approaches for data aggregation. The different analysis methods were compared based on criteria including the ability to differentiate among parks, sensitivity to uncertainty in assessment points, ability to use varied data sources, and information content for management. The results support the use of relatively simple methods such as distance-based aggregation scoring for long-term assessment of lands in this mixed-used landscape. Land use change within 5-km buffers adjacent to the parks was significantly correlated with overall scores and was a strong predictor of water quality measures. Urban parks generally scored slightly lower than parks located in more rural settings. However, the distance-based method penalized the urban parks less than other scoring approaches for several small problems, and urban parks scored fairly well by this recommended method. Trends in regional land use change should be carefully monitored, but at present, most of the parks along this urban-rural gradient are successfully fulfilling their mission of sustaining natural resources at a high level of ecological integrity.

AB  - Biotic indices have become key assessment tools in most recent national and trans-national policies aimed at improving the quality of coastal waters and the integrity of their associated ecosystems. In this study we analyzed 90 published biotic indices, classified them into four types, and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each type in relation to the requirements of these policies. We identified three main type-specific weaknesses. First, the problems of applicability, due to practical and conceptual difficulties, which affect most indices related to ecosystem function. Second, the failure of many indices based on structural attributes of the community (e.g. taxonomic composition) to link deterioration with causative stressors, or to provide an early-detection capacity. Third, the poor relevance to the ecological integrity of indices based on attributes at the sub-individual level (e.g. multi-biomarkers). Additionally, most indices still fail on two further aspects: the broad-scale applicability and the definition of reference conditions. Nowadays, the most promising approach seems to be the aggregation of indices with complementary strengths, and obtained from different biological communities.

AB  - It is easy to talk of improving river condition. It is more difficult to pin down exactly what this means. Emerging from ecology, the concept of river health presented an attempt to provide a broad framework for freshwater management incorporating both natural and human values. Initially criticised as subjective and unscientific, river health was nevertheless mainstreamed through being rendered quantifiable. Tracing the (re)definition of river health from a holistic but hazy ethic of environmental care to prescriptive indicators for intervention, I examine how common-sense understandings of river condition were first challenged by, and then incorporated within, the scholarly and political project of river health. Arguing that the search for objectivity entrenched assumptions that naturalness was both desirable and attainable, I explore the potential value of a reimagined, revitalised river health as a constructive platform for renegotiating and broadening what matters for freshwater.

AB  - The contribution of working forests to tropical conservation and development depends upon the maintenance of ecological integrity under ongoing land use. Assessment of ecological integrity requires an understanding of the structure, composition, and function and major drivers that govern their variability. Working forests in tropical river floodplains provide many goods and services, yet the data on the ecological processes that sustain these services is scant. In flooded forests of riverside Amazonian communities, we established 46 0.1-ha plots varying in flood duration, use by cattle and water buffalo, and time since agricultural abandonment (30-90 yr). We monitored three aspects of ecological integrity (stand structure, species composition, and dynamics of trees and seedlings) to evaluate the impacts of different trajectories of livestock activity (alleviation, stasis, and intensification) over nine years. Negative effects of livestock intensification were solely evident in the forest understory, and plots alleviated from past heavy disturbance increased in seedling density but had higher abundance of thorny species than plots maintaining low activity. Stand structure, dynamics, and tree species composition were strongly influenced by the natural pulse of seasonal floods, such that the defining characteristics of integrity were dependent upon flood duration (3-200 d). Forests with prolonged floods >= 140 d had not only lower species richness but also lower rates of recruitment and species turnover relative to forests with short floods < 70 d. Overall, the combined effects of livestock intensification and prolonged flooding hindered forest regeneration, but overall forest integrity was largely related to the hydrological regime and age. Given this disjunction between factors mediating canopy and understory integrity, we present a subset of metrics for regeneration and recruitment to distinguish forest condition by livestock trajectory. Although our study design includes confounded factors that preclude a definitive assessment of the major drivers of ecological change, we provide much-needed data on the regrowth of a critical but poorly studied ecosystem. In addition to its emphasis on the dynamics of tropical wetland forests undergoing anthropogenic and environmental change, our case study is an important example for how to assess of ecological integrity in working forests of tropical ecosystems.

AB  - An holistic stochastic-dynamic modelling methodology has been developed in order to predict the ecological status of lotic systems in Northeast Portugal. These procedures focus on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as some relevant benthic macroinvertebrate metrics and changes in local habitat conditions. The proposed model was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical treatment performed to discriminate the significant relationships between prevailing biological and environmental variables. Since this statistical analysis is static, the dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of habitat changes. In this way, the factors time and space are implicit in the respective treatment. Such a procedure gives credibility to the parameters included in the dynamic model construction. In order to enhance the importance of monitoring in aquatic systems based on ecological integrity indicators, different biotic metrics were selected from the studied benthic macroinvertebrate communities. The samples of aquatic macroinvertebrate, environmental and physical-chemical data were collected from three watersheds of mountain rivers in Northeast Portugal, between 1983 and 1985. The model validation was based on independent data from another watershed not included in the model construction. Thereafter, the model behaviour was tested facing a "new" scenario, namely ongoing organic pollution disturbances in the region. The results are encouraging since, after the model validation, they seem to demonstrate the reliability of the model (1) to assess the ecological status of running waters from the studied watersheds and (2) to predict the behaviour of key macroinvertebrate metrics, along an ecological gradient from relatively pristine conditions to serious human impacts.

AB  - Biological monitoring is important for assessing the ecological condition of surface waters. However, there are challenges in determining what constitutes reference conditions, what assemblages should be used as indicators, and how assemblage data should be converted into quantitative indicator scores. In this study, we developed and applied biological condition gradient (BCG) modeling to fish and macroinvertebrate data previously collected from large, sandy bottom southwestern USA rivers. Such rivers are particularly vulnerable to altered flow regimes resulting from dams, water withdrawals and climate change. We found that sensitive ubiquitous taxa for both fish and macroinvertebrates had been replaced by more tolerant taxa, but that the condition assessment ratings based on fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages differed. We conclude that the BCG models based on both macroinvertebrate and fish assemblage condition were useful for classifying the condition of southwestern USA sandy bottom rivers. However, our fish BCG model was slightly more sensitive than the macroinvertebrate model to anthropogenic disturbance, presumably because we had historical fish data, and because fish may be more sensitive to dams and altered flow regimes than are macroinvertebrates.

KW  - PERSPECTIVE
AB  - One of the most influential environmental laws in the US - the 1972 Clean Water Act - included the visionary objective of maintaining and restoring aquatic ecological integrity. However, the efficacy of the Act depends on how integrity is assessed. Reviewing the assessment literature for fresh waters over the past 40 years, we found evidence of methodological trends toward increased repeatability, transferability, and robustness of assessments over time. However, implementation gaps were revealed, based on the relatively weak linkages to freshwater policies, stakeholder involvement, emerging threats, and conservation opportunities. A related survey of assessment practitioners underscored the disparity between need versus availability of assessments that guide management policies. Technological changes in data collection and synthesis have clearly influenced assessments, and appear to have led to a reduced reliance on ecological response indicators and corresponding increases in stressor-based metrics. We recommend designing assessments around specific fresh-water policies and regulations to improve applicability of assessment products for management and conservation.

AB  - Recovery trajectories from restoration projects are poorly understood, making it difficult to set restoration targets as part of project planning. As part of the Delaware River Watershed Initiative (DRWI), we collected baseline environmental and biological data at 84 sites in watersheds where agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) are being implemented and forested land is being preserved. The objective of this study was to understand which diatom and macroinvertebrate community measures best characterize biological integrity along a gradient of land cover, habitat measures, and water chemistry in order to later set targets for recovery. To this end, we ran separate Redundancy Analysis (RDA) ordinations in which environmental variables constrained (1) community metrics and (2) relative abundance (taxonomic composition) for macroinvertebrates and diatoms. To understand where along the environmental gradient the sites were represented differently by the respective biotic community measures (community metrics and taxonomic composition), the two constrained ordinations were then compared using Procrustes distance. For macroinvertebrate communities, we saw the most agreement in site characterization between the ordinations at intermediate % agricultural land, but disagreement at both high and low % agricultural land. For diatom communities, we saw the most agreement between the site characterizations at high to intermediate % agricultural land, with increasing disagreement associated with increasing % forested land cover. Use of baseline data to set targets for ecosystem recovery requires consideration of which data are most relevant for the site conditions and what amount of change is feasible based on project implementation and effectiveness. A key aspect of choosing endpoints is when the loss of information inherent to metrics makes them less useful for accurately evaluating ecological integrity, especially when looking to capture incremental changes. Based on our findings, we suggest the use of some community metrics and some key taxa to set targets of recovery in biotic communities in agricultural streams, and that these targets be adjusted to best fit the ecological conditions at a given site within a larger data set. Accordingly, monitoring must take place in the context of regional conditions and must be designed to inform target-setting.

Multivariate analyses (cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling) and rank-abundance diagrams were used to characterize community patterns to assess ecological integrity in response to environmental conditions. Species composition patterns were mainly influenced by both the gradient of physicochemical variables (e.g., altitude, slope, conductivity) and the proportion of forest area. Community structure patterns were further correlated to the proportion of urbanization and to biological indices (e.g., diversity, number of species). Land use preferences of benthic species were identified based on the indicator values and weighted averaging regression models. Plecoptera species were representative of undisturbed streams in forest areas, whereas Tubificidae species and filtering collector caddis flies were indicator taxa in severely polluted and agricultural areas, respectively. The analyses of community structures and indicator species effectively characterized community properties and ecological integrity following natural and anthropogenic variability in urban stream ecosystems.

AB  - Facing increasing levels of ecosystem degradation, scientists and practitioners aim to preserve ecological integrity to maintain structures and functions expected of ecosystems in a region. This requires an understanding of the relationship between structural components and functional integrity. In this paper we focused on the study forests of the Credit River Watershed (Southern Ontario, Canada). For this ecosystem we consider one of the major contributors to functional integrity: habitat functions which are defined as the capacity of the ecosystem to provide refuge and reproduction habitat to wild species of plants and animals. We define these 'habitat functions' as a latent variable in Structural Equation Modeling, which allows us to examine its relationship with a number of candidate indicators. We first determined two community-level structural indicators to represent the latent variable: native plant cover and forest bird abundance. We then found underlying causal relationships between multi-scale structural components of the ecosystem and the provision of habitat functions. Three variables at the local scale explain native plant cover soil nitrogen, soil organic matter, and soil pH. A significant landscape-level variable, patch area, explained native plant cover. Percent natural land cover in a 500 m radius explained forest bird abundance. From a theoretical point of view, this modeling technique allows us to explore complex and simultaneous interactions between structures and functions of ecosystems. As for its practical applications, it can be used to improve ecological integrity monitoring programs by contributing to the selection of meaningful indicators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Northwestern coastal desert of Egypt is under pressure of human-induced changes due urban sprawl and agricultural practices leading to negative impacts on existing natural habitats. Assessing the impact of land-use changes on the ecological integrity is crucial for management and conservation efforts in the region. Floristic quality (FQ) assessment indices are important bioassessment tools that can be used to evaluate how anthropogenic changes may influence vegetation quality, species composition and environmental integrity. The approach is primarily stationed on floristic composition and disturbance tolerance at study sites. The objectives of this study were to: 1) study how anthropogenic disturbances due to land use/cover changes in the northwestern coastal desert affected its ecological quality as indicated by FQ indices; and 2) to evaluate the use of FQ indices as tools for characterizing anthropogenic disturbance among the habitats of Mediterranean desert ecosystem. Stands representing the main habitats were surveyed during 2011 through 2015 and data were compared to historic data collected before the developmental activities. The study revealed a trend of decline with time in the floristic quality of the study area as was indicated by floristic quality measures used (mean coefficient of conservatism, FQAI, and adjusted FQAI). Similar trend of decline in native and perennial species richness, and increase in non-native and annual species richness was observed for the period investigated from 1980s to time. At the habitat level, similar trend of decline in the floristic quality was observed, with the current time attaining the least values of FQ indices for all the habitats. The anthropogenic disturbance index (ADI) was developed in the current study as a quantitative measure of the level of disturbance and as an indicator to evaluate site's ecological condition. The ADI exhibited significant negative relationship with the FQ indices, revealing that it can be recognized as useful index of anthropogenic disturbance that would complement the use of FQ indices in evaluating site ecological condition. The high association between ADI and the adjusted FQAI compared to the FQAI, confirms that the former signals the level of disturbance better than later. Although the adjusted FQAI has been developed and used in assessing vegetation quality of wetland, the current study revealed that it can be employed successfully for assessing and monitoring changes in vegetation quality and ecological integrity of deserts and arid ecosystems. For full and comprehensive evaluation of site's ecological condition, the use of multiple bioindicators is recommended.

AB  - Ecologists and natural resource managers struggle to define and relate biodiversity, biocomplexity, ecological integrity, ecosystem services, and related concepts; to describe effects of disturbance dynamics on biodiversity; and to understand how biodiversity relates to resilience, resistance, and stability of ecosystems and sustainability of resource conditions. Further diversifying this "lexicon zoo" are the ecological roles of rare species and refugia, and measures of surrogates and indicators of biodiversity parameters. To impart order on this lexicon zoo, a "concept map" framework is suggested for clearly defining biodiversity parameters and related terms, relating biodiversity to ecosystem services and sustainability, describing how disturbance affects biodiversity, and identifying biodiversity parameters for management and monitoring. Many relations among these concepts are poorly understood in managed forest environments and are presented here as testable tenets. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wetland rapid assessment has become popular in a variety of applications. Because rapid assessments rely on observable field indicators as surrogates for direct measures of condition, they must be validated against independent data. Here we present a case study of the validation of the riverine and estuarine modules of the California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM). We evaluated responsiveness of the method to "good" vs. "poor" wetland condition, ability to represent a range of conditions, internal redundancy, alternative combination rules for constituent metrics, and reproducibility of results. Because no independent, concurrently collected measure of condition directly reflecting the same elements comprising CRAM was available for validation, we demonstrate the use of existing monitoring and assessment data on avian diversity, benthic macroinvertebrate indices, and plant community composition. Results indicate that CRAM is an effective tool for assessing general riverine and estuarine wetland condition based on its correspondence with multiple independent assessments of condition. Reproducibility analysis revealed several problematic metrics where ambiguous language or metric construction led to high inter-team error rates. Addressing these issues improved overall average error to within 5%. This study demonstrates that, when validated, rapid assessment methods provide a meaningful and reliable tool for assessing wetland condition.

AB  - We suggest that sustainability can be defined on the basis of intergenerational efficiency once the welfare potentials of future generations are explicitly taken into account. The present paper argues that Sustainable Development is the kind of economic process that ensures the environmental prerequisites for intergenerational welfare efficiency.
   This paper focuses on the dependency of intergenerational efficiency on natural (biological-ecological) capital. The application of the efficiency criterion in the intergenerational context requires the preservation of the biological integrity of ecosystems. In order to make this idea operational, we suggest the preservation of key biological - ecological thresholds. These thresholds represent an operational, measurable entity inspired by contemporary trends in biological conservation, offering key indicators in design sustainability policies.

AB  - Immediate post-thaw evaluation of membrane integrity has proven to yield overestimates of cell survival under conditions that preclude intracellular ice formation (IIF). However, prominent theories on the mechanisms of intracellular nucleation suggest a damaged membrane can reseal, prompting us to evaluate whether immediate post-thaw assessments of membrane integrity can in fact underestimate cell survival under conditions that promote IIF. HUVEC and HepG2 monolayers were treated with 1.4 M DMSO and frozen to -25 degrees C under conditions that formed either 0% or 100% IIF. Membrane integrity was evaluated both immediately and 24 h post-thaw, with metabolic activity assessments performed 24 h post-thaw as a secondary measure of survival. Treatment with 1.4 M DMSO and nucleation of 100% IIF resulted in a drastic increase in the relative percent of membrane intact cells following a 24 h culture period (HUVEC: 90.2% +/- 0.7%; HepG2: 70.4% +/- 4.0%), which correlated with 24 h post-thaw metabolic activity. These differences between the immediate and 24 h post-thaw membrane integrity assessments were significantly more than those seen in the absence of either IIF or DMSO treatment. Therefore, a high incidence of IIF in DMSO-treated monolayers may lead to erroneous underestimates of cell survival when conducting immediate post-thaw assessments of membrane integrity.

AB  - While ecosystem services provide benefits at various spatial scales, often the decision to conserve an ecosystem lies with the local people. Knowing the perceptions of local landowners of the benefits provided by ecosystem services cannot only help in the design of efficient mechanisms for environmental conservation, but also in achieving the support of these mechanisms by the local stakeholders. In this article we use both standard scientific assessment and the stakeholders' local ecological knowledge in order to acquire information about both the ecological integrity of an Atlantic Forest watershed, and the ecosystem services it provides. In a small-scale case study of the Macabu River watershed in Brazil, we investigated and compared a rapid field assessment of stream ecological integrity with the stakeholders' local environmental perceptions as revealed through interviews. This comparison indicates that the farmers tended to overestimate the ecological integrity of the stream reaches located inside their properties. However, the farmers also showed ecological knowledge about the environment and forests' ecosystem services, such as the maintenance of water supply and suitable climatic conditions. Our results thus indicate that the farmers' perceptions about the environmental impacts and ecological integrity of forest and water are apparently more strongly influenced by direct uses and opportunity costs, representing a market failure of asymmetrical information. Such market failure could be overcome by more fully informing farmers about ecosystem services and possible direct economic advantages of riparian forests. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human activities have impacted many environments on earth, and thus several species are facing an increased risk of extinction. The environmental crisis requires rapid tools to assess the ecosystem health accurately. Studies have been conducted with visual indices that quantify habitat integrity by predicting species richness and diversity. However, whether a diverse clade can predict habitat integrity has not been used. The genus Argia (Rambur, 1842) is one of the most locally diverse groups in southeastern Mexico. In this context, we hypothesized that the occurrence, species richness, and diversity of adults Argia spp. could be a better predictor of the Visual-Based Habitat Assessment Score (VBHAS) than the other taxonomic levels or less diverse clades. We found that the richness and diversity of Argia spp. are positively correlated with VBHA scores, as same as taxonomic ratios. Simultaneously, VBHA scores increase to 23.51 times when Argia spp. diversity increases. We discuss the possible use of a diverse Odonata clade, as Argia spp. could surrogate habitat integrity for local long-term biomonitoring programs. This approach requires testing with other indices and verifying a reliable and consistent relationship between diverse clades and environmental assessment scores.

AB  - Pressurized gas pipelines are subject to harmful effects from both the surrounding environments and the materials passing through them. Reliable assessment procedures, including fracture mechanics analyses, are required to maintain their integrity. Currently, integrity assessments are performed using conventional deterministic approaches, even though there are many uncertainties to hinder rational evaluations. Therefore, in this study, a probabilistic approach was considered for gas pipeline evaluations. The objectives are to estimate the failure probability of corroded pipelines in the gas and oil industries and to propose operating limit conditions for different types of loadings. To achieve these objectives, a probabilistic assessment program was developed using reliability index method and simulation techniques, and applied to estimate the failure probabilities of corroded API-5L-X52/X60 gas pipelines subjected to internal pressure, bending moment, and combined loading. The operating limit conditions as well as prototypal evaluation and sensitivity analysis results showed a promising applicability of the probabilistic integrity assessment program.

AB  - We propose a multi-level concept for fish-based assessment (MuLFA) of the ecological integrity of running waters. This concept is designed for large-scale monitoring programmes such as required for the proposed Water Framework Directive of the EU. Out of five different biological organisation levels (fauna, community, guild, population and individual), we propose seven criteria: River-type-specific species, species with self-sustaining populations, fish region, number of guilds, guild composition, population size and population age structure. The principle of the MuLFA is based on assessing the deviation from undisturbed reference conditions. Reference conditions have to be compiled for every distinct river type using historical fish and abiotic data, present river-type-specific reference sites and reference models. The final assessment procedure is done by comparing the assessment reach with the reference conditions using a 5-tiered normative scheme and assigning that reach to the level of highest coincidence. The benefit of the MuLFA is its potential for consistent sensitivity to low- and high-dose human alterations, and due to its general character, its adaptability to all river types.

AB  - A key challenge in evaluating coastal and watershed management decisions is that monitoring efforts are largely focused On reef condition, yet stakeholder concerns may be more appropriately quantified by social and economic metrics. There is an urgent need for predictive models to quantitatively link ecological condition of coral reefs to provisioning of reef ecosystem goods and services. We investigated and compared a number of existing methods for quantifying ecological integrity, shoreline protection, recreational opportunities, fisheries production, and the potential for natural products discovery from reefs. Methods were applied to mapping potential ecosystem services production around St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Overall, we found that a number of different methods produced similar predictions. Furthermore, areas predicted to be high in ecological integrity also tended to be high in other ecosystem services, including the potential for recreation, natural products discovery, and fisheries production, but this result depended on the method by which ecosystem services supply was calculated. Quantitative methods linking reef condition to ecosystem goods and services can aid in highlighting the social and economic relevance of reefs, and provide essential information to more completely characterize, model, and map the trade-offs inherent in decision options.

AB  - Ecological integrity is an overarching concept that integrates multiple properties of ecosystems, including structure, function and resilience to external change. We explore the links between ecological integrity and structural surrogates for ecosystem functioning to develop a cost-effective assessment of Functional Integrity for marine habitats based on biological traits, abundance and heterogeneity, focused on the visible components of the sea-floor, i.e., epibenthic flora and fauna and seabed biogenic habitat features. The assessment was based on diversity and redundancy of functional traits of the identified benthic components, supplemented by estimates of spatial heterogeneity (habitat transitions) and vertical habitat complexity. This approach was developed using video data collected in different years with different sampling strategies in two locations: Kawau Bay in North Island of New Zealand, and Port Pegasus in Stewart Island, off South Island of New Zealand; this last location was a priori expected to be nearly pristine. Despite variability in sampling techniques and environmental settings, the approach proved effective and evidenced higher measures of Functional Integrity in the Port Pegasus location. This study introduces a first step to measure ecological integrity by successfully converting video data to surrogates of Functional Integrity, in a way expected to be habitat independent.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems have been degraded by multiple stressors. To mitigate the effects of multiple stressors on freshwater ecosystems, we must assess the current ecological condition of these systems, diagnose the cause of the environmental impact, and predict how they will respond to future changes in anthropogenic pressures. Most biomonitoring programs use metrics of community structure to quantify ecological condition; however, they do not assess the overall ecological integrity of an ecosystem, including ecosystem function. This series of papers explores how structural and functional aspects of stream ecosystems can respond to different stressors. The use of a combination of structural and functional measures increases the ability to assess degradation of stream ecosystem integrity. We suggest that future studies should focus on development of measures that integrate ecosystem structure and function, such as the identification and refinement of species traits that are clearly associated with important functional properties of species and whose responses to different anthropogenic pressures can aid in informing the specific management activities likely to be most effective in restoring degraded stream ecosystems.

AB  - The complexity of natural river ecosystems is driven by the natural flow regime. Alteration of the flow regime generates changes in geomorphological processes and poses a challenge to conservation of the integrity of biotic communities. The modifications of flow regimes can produce serious changes to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. The present study aims to evaluate these changes in two regulated rivers under different management regimes. The reaches are located upstream and downstream of two reservoirs in the Mundo and Segura Rivers (Southeast Spain) and were sampled in spring, 2006. According to the Water Framework Directive, ecological condition should be evaluated by observed deviation from the expected natural condition. In this study, we applied this concept to determine the degree of alteration in the regulated reaches. The evaluation of ecological status has been performed by applying a multimetric focus using indices derived from the community of macroinvertebrates (MCLM) and fish (SI) as biological elements as well as a riparian forest index (RQI), which analyzes a hydromorphological element. The assessment of ecological status revealed degradation in the quality of reaches downstream of reservoirs. These three biological indicators are sensitive to the alteration of natural flows produced by regulation. Flow regimes are modified due to a need to store water resources for economic purposes; however flow regimes should be planned in accordance with the natural cycle so that ecosystem quality is preserved and not further degraded in the future.

AB  - There is both a fundamental and applied need to define expectations of changes in aquatic ecosystems due to global changes. It is clear that programs using biological indicators and reference-based comparisons as the foundation for assessments are likely to make increasingly erroneous decisions if the impacts of global change are ignored. Global changes influence all aspects of water resource management decisions based on comparisons to reference conditions with impacts making it increasingly problematic to find an "undisturbed" water body to define acceptable conditions of ecological integrity. Using a more objective scale for characterizing reference conditions that is anchored in expectations for what would be attainable under undisturbed conditions, such as the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is one approach that maintains consistent definitions for ecosystem conditions. In addition, protection of reference stations and of unique or undisturbed aquatic resources is imperative, though the scope of protection options is limited. Projections indicate that encroaching land use will affect 36-48% of current reference surface waters by the year 2100. The interpretation of biological indicators is also at risk from global changes. Distinguishing taxonomic attributes based on temperature or hydrologic preferences can be used to enhance the ability to make inferences about global change effects compared to other stressors. Difficulties arise in categorizing unique indicators of global changes, because of similarities in some of the temperature and hydrologic effects resulting from climate change, land use changes, and water removal. In the quest for biological indicators that might be uniquely sensitive to one global stressor as an aid in recognizing probable causes of ecosystem damage, the potential similarities in indicator responses among global and landscape-scale changes needs to be recognized as a limiting factor. Many aspects of global changes are not tractable at the local to regional scales at which water quality regulations are typically managed. Our ability to implement water policies through bioassessment will require a shift in the scale of assessment, planning, and adaptations in order to fulfill our ultimate regulatory goals of preserving good water quality and ecological integrity. Providing clear expectations of effects due to global change for key species and communities in freshwater ecosystems will help water quality programs achieve their goals under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - The assessment of ecological integrity of river systems is multidisciplinary and necessary for effective river management. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of macroinvertebrate and algae community assemblages; (ii) to determine the environmental variables that affect assemblage distributions; and (iii) to determine the suitability of the selected bioindicators in relation to environmental conditions. Two agriculturally influenced coastal rivers, in the southern Cape Province, South Africa, provided case studies. Wet and dry season's results indicated that minimally impacted sites were associated with pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate and algal taxa with increased habitat scores. These sites were dominated by diatoms and macroinvertebrates indicative of low electrical conductivity (12-16 mS m(-1)), pH (4-5), and alkalinity (0.5-2.1 mg l(-1)). A positive correlation between nitrogen and phosphorus and river flow regime occurred at agriculturally impacted sites and algal taxa changes were driven by nutrient enrichment. Macroinvertebrates were indicative of habitat integrity and river condition while diatoms were indicative of pH and electrical conductivity. The benthic filamentous algae were indicative of increased nutrients and alkalinity. Results suggest that the full consortium of algae and macroinvertebrates be used as bioindicators for ecological integrity assessments in short, coastal rivers, which have application to rivers generally.

AB  - In recent years, several sets of legislation worldwide (Oceans Act in USA, Australia or Canada; Water Framework Directive or Marine Strategy in Europe, National Water Act in South Africa, etc.) have been developed in order to address ecological quality or integrity, within estuarine and coastal systems. Most such legislation seeks to define quality in an integrative way, by using several biological elements, together with physico-chemical and pollution elements. Such an approach allows assessment of ecological status at the ecosystem level ('ecosystem approach' or 'holistic approach' methodologies), rather than at species level (e.g. mussel biomonitoring or Mussel Watch) or just at chemical level (i.e. quality objectives) alone.
   Increasing attention has been paid to the development of tools for different physico-chemical or biological (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, algae, phanerogams, fishes) elements of the ecosystems. However, few methodologies integrate all the elements into a single evaluation of a water body. The need for such integrative tools to assess ecosystem quality is very important, both from a scientific and stakeholder point of view. Politicians and managers need information from simple and pragmatic, but scientifically sound methodologies, in order to show to society the evolution of a zone (estuary, coastal area, etc.), taking into account human pressures or recovery processes.
   These approaches include: (i) multidisciplinarity, inherent in the teams involved in their implementation; (ii) integration of biotic and abiotic factors; (iii) accurate and validated methods in determining ecological integrity; and (iv) adequate indicators to follow the evolution of the monitored ecosystems. While some countries increasingly use the establishment of marine parks to conserve marine biodiversity and ecological integrity, there is awareness (e.g. in Australia) that conservation and management of marine ecosystems cannot be restricted to Marine Protected Areas but must include areas outside such reserves.
   This contribution reviews the current situation of integrative ecological assessment worldwide, by presenting several examples from each of the continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cyano-HABs are proliferating around the world due to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of freshwater bodies. This study seeks to obtain a holistic vision over the various threats that affect the Cyano-HABs of Umia basin and especially of A Baxe reservoir (Galicia, NW Spain), through the method of Partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM). The A Baxe reservoirs is a fundamental source of drinking water supply to surrounding dwellings. This study identifies and quantify the variables that increase contaminant concentration and decrease ecological integrity, as well as how this scenario evolved over various hydrologic years. In this regard, the PLS-PM equations will be robust and powerful tools to predict changes in eutrophication and ecological integrity, as response to measures implemented in the basin that can improve water quality. The dependent latent variables are "Eutrophication" (chlorophyl-a, Microcystis sp.) and "Ecological Integrity" (METI Bioindicator). The independent latent variables are "SWP", which represents surface water parameters (phosphorus, nitrogen and pH) and "Climatic Conditions" (temperature, precipitation). The PLS-PM results revealed that 51.0% of "Eutrophication" is predicted by the independent variables. The connections between latent variables are quantified through path coefficients (beta). The "SWP" contributes by increasing "Eutrophication" (beta = 0.235), the same occurring with the "Climatic Conditions" (beta = -0.672). The variables "Eutrophication" (beta = -0.217) and "SWP" (beta = -0.483) lower the "Ecological Integrity". On the other hand, different trophic scenarios, adapted to the temperature increase predicted for the study area, were tested, and it was found that ecological integrity would improve by 46% if the oligotrophic state were reached. Therefore, it is recommended to prevent pollution by means of water control and governance plans, as well as corrective and preventive measures, which guarantee the water security of the river basins. Despite the complex mathematics behind the PLS-PM models, their user-friendly development and application through interactive graphical interfaces make them easily transposable to other eutrophic reservoirs, widening the readership of these studies focused on multiple-geosphere assessment of environmental impacts.

AB  - 1. Modification of natural landscapes and land-use intensification are global phenomena that can result in a range of differing pressures on lotic ecosystems. We analysed national-scale databases to quantify the relationship between three land uses (indigenous vegetation, urbanisation and agriculture) and indicators of stream ecological integrity. Boosted regression tree modelling was used to test the response of 14 indicators belonging to four groups water quality (at 578 sites), benthic invertebrates (at 2666 sites), fish (at 6858 sites) and ecosystem processes (at 156 sites). Our aims were to characterise the ecological response curves of selected functional and structural metrics in relation to three land uses, examine the environmental moderators of these relationships and quantify the relative utility of metrics as indicators of stream ecological integrity.

AB  - Despite improved understanding of how aquatic organisms are influenced by environmental conditions at multiple scales, we lack a coherent multiscale approach for establishing stream conservation priorities in active coal-mining regions. We classified watershed conditions at 3 hierarchical spatial scales, following a house-neighborhood-community approach, where houses (stream segments) are embedded within neighborhoods (Hydrologic Unit Code [HUC]-12 watersheds) embedded within communities (HUC-10 watersheds). We used this information to develop a framework to prioritize restoration and protection in two HUC-8 watersheds in an intensively mined region of the central Appalachians. We used landscape data to predict current conditions (water chemistry and macroinvertebrate biotic integrity) for all stream segments with boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis. Mining intensity, distance to mining, and coal type were the dominant predictors of water quality and biological integrity. A hardness-salinity dimension of the water-chemistry data was explained by land-cover features and stream elevation. We compiled segment-level conditions to the HUC-12 and HUC-10 watershed scales to represent aquatic resource conditions hierarchically across 3 watershed-management scales. This process enabled us to relate stream-segment watershed conditions to watershed conditions in the broader context, and ultimately to identify key protection and restoration priorities in a metacommunity context. Our hierarchical classification system explicitly identifies stream restoration and protection priorities within a HUC-12 watershed context, which ensures that the benefits of restoration will extend beyond the stream reach. Highest protection priorities are high-quality HUC-12 watersheds adjacent to low-quality HUC-12 watersheds. Highest restoration priorities are HUC-12 watersheds in poor-fair condition within HUC-10 watersheds of good-excellent condition, whereas lowest restoration priorities are isolated HUC-12 watersheds. In high-priority HUC-12 watersheds, stream segments with the highest restoration priority are those that maximize watershed-scale restorability. A similar process for classifying conditions and restoration priorities may be valuable in other heavily impacted regions where strategic approaches are needed to maximize watershed-scale recovery.

KW  - INDEX
AB  - Environmental Water Assessments (EWAs) aim to protect the ecological integrity of rivers amidst increasing anthropogenic pressures on freshwater resources, and fish communities are the ecosystem component most commonly included. The Fish Response Assessment Index (FRAI) was developed to assess the integrity of fish communities in South African rivers and is commonly applied in EWA studies. This paper reports on the suitability of the FRAI for the non-perennial Seekoei River and discusses some of the challenges faced. Our relatively long and thorough study on the Seekoei River confirmed the concerns that earlier, snapshot, fish integrity assessments in the Orange River system raised: that the existing fish indices are not ideally suited for these rivers with their naturally low species richness and hardy, generalist fish communities. Other difficulties with the use of a score-based method include prediction of the expected species, calculation of a frequency of occurrence rating, selection of the right sampling times for comparative purposes, loss of habitats and sampling points under different flow conditions, and problems experienced when using accumulated data to try to correct for a situation of having too few sampling points. At this stage a more generalised approach is suggested for the Seekoei River, and ultimately other similar non-perennial systems. This could include a number of community characteristics, such as abundance, species richness, species diversity and evenness, recruitment, fish health and the presence/absence of exotic species.

AB  - Functional integrity is the intactness of soil and native vegetation patterns and the processes that maintain these patterns. In Australia's rangelands, the integrity of these patterns and processes have been modified by clearing, grazing and fire. Intuitively, biodiversity should be strongly related to functional integrity; that is, landscapes with high functional integrity should maintain biodiversity, and altered, less functional landscapes may lose some biodiversity, defined here as the variety and abundance of the plants, animals and microorganisms of concern. Simple indicators of biodiversity and functional integrity are needed that can be monitored at a range of scales, from fine to coarse. In the present paper, we use examples, primarily from published work on Australia's rangeland, to document that at finer patch and hillslope scales several indicators of landscape functional integrity have been identified. These indicators, based on the quantity and quality of vegetation patches and interpatch zones, are related to biodiversity. For example, a decrease in the cover and width (quantity) and condition (quality) of vegetation patches, and an increase in bare soil (quantity of interpatch) near cattle watering points in a paddock are significantly related to declines in plant and grasshopper diversity. These vegetation patch-cover and bare-soil indicators have been monitored traditionally by field-based methods, but new high-resolution, remote-sensing imagery can be used in specific rangeland areas for this fine-scale monitoring. At intermediate paddock and small watershed scales, indicators that can be derived from medium-resolution remote-sensing are also needed for efficient monitoring of rangeland condition (i.e. functional integrity) and biodiversity. For example, 30-100-m-pixel Landsat imagery has been used to assess the condition of rangelands along grazing gradients extending from watering-points. The variety and abundance of key taxa have been related to these gradients (the Biograze project). At still larger region and catchment scales, indicators of rangeland functional integrity can also be monitored by coarse-resolution remote-sensing and related to biodiversity. For example, the extent and greenness (condition) of different regional landscapes have been monitored with 1-km-pixel satellite imagery. This regional information becomes more valuable when it indicates differences as a result of land management. Finally, we discuss potential future developments that could improve proposed indicators of landscape functional integrity and biodiversity, thereby improving our ability to monitor rangelands effectively.

AB  - Ecological indicators that evaluate the status and trends of mammalian apex predators are necessary for monitoring the ecological integrity of landscapes. Several nation-wide spatial indicators that describe the status of apex predators after habitat transformation have been developed for Mexico. These spatial indicators show the condition of the remnant natural landscape for maintaining the complexity of predator-prey interactions and habitat selection and use. The indicators were obtained using the concept of ecological integrity, that characterize the landscape based upon manifest and latent variables of naturalness, stability and self-organization, according with the measures of spatial distribution of species and natural habitat. When the current status is evaluated for individual species of apex predators, all species showed less than 50% of their distribution areas with a high degree of ecological integrity. Neotropical predators (such as jaguars and ocelots) are more threatened by the transformation of natural habitat, than their counterparts in Nearctic regions (e.g., bears, cougars, bobcats, and coyotes), which showed nonetheless, a high amount of their distribution areas with a high proportion of degraded habitat. The indicators allowed evaluating the status of still extant top predators in the landscape and their habitat condition within major ecoregions in the country.

AB  - Water management is a crucial tool for addressing the increasing uncertainties caused by climate change, biodiversity loss and the conditions of socioeconomic limits. The multiple factors affecting water resources need to be successfully managed to achieve optimal governance and thus move towards water security. This study seeks to obtain a holistic vision of the various threats that affect the ecological integrity of the basins that form the hydrological district of Galicia-Costa, through the method of partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM). The data is analysed overall for the hydrological years from 2009 to 2015. The independent latent variables are "Anthropogenic" (comprising the percentage of water bodies with edges alongside artificial surfaces, the percentage connected to artificial land use patches, the edge density of artificial surfaces and population density) and "Nature" (edge density of forestry land uses, edge length of land water bodies alongside forested areas and the percentage of land occupied by the largest patch of forest). The dependent latent variables are "SWP", which represents surface water parameters (biological oxygen demand, chlorides, conductivity and dissolved iron) and "Ecological Integrity" (METI Bioindicator). The connections between latent variables are uantified through path coefficients (beta). From an overall perspective, the PLS-PM results reveal that 69.0% of "SWP" is predicted by the independent variables (R-2 = 0.690), "Anthropogenic" contributes by increasing SWP (beta = 0.471), while "Nature" decreases the concentration of SWP (beta = -0.523), which indicates the polluting parameters in the water. The variables "Anthropogenic" (beta = -0.351) and "SWP" (beta = -0.265) lower the quality of "Ecological Integrity". This variable must be managed through soil conservation measures for the benefit of water security. This study has been able to identify and quantify the variables that increase contaminant concentration and decrease ecological integrity, providing a promising methodology that facilitates protection and correction measures to guarantee water safety.

AB  - We assessed ecosystem integrity in restored prairie wetlands in eastern South Dakota, U.S.A., by examining the relationship between and diatom diversity and production. We asked three questions: (1) Is production related to species diversity? (2) Can production-diversity relationships be used to distinguish between restored and reference wetlands with the purpose of assessing ecological integrity? (3) Are production-diversity relationships influenced by species composition? Eight undisturbed, unrestored wetlands were chosen as references to compare to eight wetlands restored after drainage. Diatoms were collected from artificial substrates that allowed communities to be transplanted from restored to reference wetlands and visa versa. Production was measured as total cell biovolume and diversity as species richness. Neither diversity nor production alone differed between restored and reference wetlands. However, production was negatively related to diversity at restored wetlands, whereas production at reference wetlands was not. Communities transplanted from reference to restored wetlands exhibited a production-diversity relationship like that observed among control samples in restored wetlands. Likewise, communities transplanted from restored to reference wetlands apparently lost any such relationship after they were relocated. Production was dependent on species composition. Furthermore, production of some species differed by restored and reference wetland type. The negative relationship observed between diversity and production was strongly influenced by Rhopalodia gibba and Epithemia species, suggesting that these species were superior competitors under the conditions found in some restored wetlands. We consider restored wetlands displaying the highest production:diversity ratio to be the most impaired sites, based on the extreme deviation from reference wetlands. We conclude that the relationships between diversity and production provided a rapid measure of restored wetland integrity with respect to baseline conditions observed in reference sites.

AB  - Fish communities in large rivers are characterized by a high diversity, which reflects the structural diversity and habitat richness of inshore zones and connected floodplains. The connectivity of the different habitat elements in a broad spatio-temporal context, i.e., at various scales from catchment to microhabitat - and their nestedness - define the fitness of fish species both on the individual level (e.g., growth performances) and population level (i.e., population structure, mortality, etc.). Relevant spatial scales can be the whole river course in the case of some anadromous migrators or the availability of complementary microhabitat elements, e.g., during the early ontogeny of a species. The significance of connectivity at various scales from whole river to local reach have to be evaluated based on the requirements, reaction norms, and ecological flexibility of individual species. Integrity has to be evaluated in several respects:
   (1) with regard to population genetics over extensive biogeographic areas and in long time scales;
   (2) with regard to supplementary habitats in the course of the life cycle of individual species with ontogenetic habitat shifts and specific requirements during the reproductive phase;
   (3) with regard to longitudinal and lateral transport and exchange processes determining local habitat conditions and the food supply for fish.
   Due to these dependencies the status and condition of the fish fauna is a critical sensor of integrity at different scales and thus a good monitoring tool especially with regard to river engineering. The structure of the fish population - in particular the relative abundance of specifically adapted floodplain species - provides information on the overall conditions. For a more detailed evaluation the local distribution pattern of the fish fauna, population structure, seasonality, and growth performances of the early life history stages can indicate the quality and extent of connectedness at a finer scale and can be used to define management and engineering criteria.

AB  - In Maryland, U. S., an interim framework has recently been developed for using biologically based thresholds, or 'biocriteria', to assess the health of nontidal streams statewide at watershed scales. The evaluation of impairment is based on indices of biological integrity from the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). We applied logistic regression to quantify how the biotic integrity of streams at a local scale is affected by cumulative effects resulting from catchment land uses, point sources, and nearby transmission line rights-of-way. Indicators for land use were developed from the remote sensing National Land Cover Data and applied at different scales. We determined that the risk of local impairment in nontidal streams rapidly increases with increased urban land use in the catchment area. The average likelihood of failing biocriteria doubled with every 10% points increment in urban land, thus an increase in urban land use from 0 to 20% quadruples the risk of impairment. For the basins evaluated in this study, catchments with more than 40-50% urban land use had greater than 80% probability of failing biocriteria, on average. Inclusion of rights-of-way and point sources in the model did not significantly improve the fit for this data set, most likely because of their low numbers. The overall results indicate that our predictive modeling approach can help pinpoint stream ecosystems experiencing or vulnerable to degradation.

AB  - Signatory countries to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are formulating goals and indicators through 2050 under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Among the goals is increasing the integrity of ecosystems. The CBD is now seeking input toward a quantifiable definition of integrity and methods to track it globally. Here, we offer a schema for using Earth observations (EO) to monitor and evaluate global forest ecosystem integrity (EI). Our approach builds on three topics: the concept of EI, the use of satellite-based EO, and the use of "essential biodiversity variables" to monitor and report on it. Within this schema, EI is a measure of the structure, function, and composition of an ecosystem relative to the range of variation determined by climatic-geophysical environment. We use evaluation criteria to recommend eight potential indicators of EI that can be monitored around the globe using Earth Observations to support the efforts of nations to monitor and report progress to implement the post-2020 GBF. If operationalized, this schema should help Parties to the CBD take action and report progress on achieving ecosystem commitments during this decade.

AB  - Differences in sampling in laboratory protocols, differences in techniques used to evaluate metrics, and differing scales of calibration and application prohibit the use of many existing multimetric indices (MMIs) in large-scale bioassessments. We describe in approach to developing MMIs, of ecological condition that is applicable to a variety of biological assemblage types and to spatially extensive (regional, national) aquatic resource surveys. The process involves testing the performance characteristics of candidate metrics in several categories that correspond to key dimensions of biotic condition. The performance characteristics include: information content (range), reproducibility, calibration for natural gradients, responsiveness to stressor gradients, and independence from other metrics. The best-performing metric from each category is included in the final MMI. The consistency of the process enables development of separate MMIs in different regions that can be combined in a national assessment and that are more comparable across regions and taxonomic groups than a set of independently developed MMIs would be. We provide an example of the process applied to macroinvertebrate data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) from 3045 sites (of which 1390 were WSA probability sites). The MMIs developed for the WSA demonstrate the feasibility of conducting bioassessments at continental scales and provide a basis for interpreting existing MMIs from regional- and national-level perspectives.

AB  - This work provides insight into an Andean-Amazonian river system by conducting a comprehensive study of the biodiversity and ecological processes in a poorly studied neotropical freshwater ecosystem. Hacha River in western Colombia harbours a rich and largely unknown biodiversity and is experiencing an increase in anthropogenic impacts from the city of Florencia. Changes in natural habitat characteristics and environmental quality were analysed and related to the distribution of fish and macroinvertebrates. Four environmental quality indices were applied, and concentrations of potential water pollutants were measured. All environmental quality indices used were reliable because they produced similar assessments of the ecological integrity of the study sites and were inversely related to the potential water pollutant concentrations. Fish and macroinvertebrate communities notably changed in response to differences in environmental quality, reinforcing the ecological integrity assessments. Nevertheless, natural gradients that influence fish and macroinvertebrate distributions showed an overlap with changes in environmental quality, thereby confounding the ability to discern the influence of natural and anthropogenic-induced alterations and to confirm an initial shift in fish assemblages due to anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Water resources managers and conservation biologists need reliable, quantitative, and directly comparable methods for assessing the biological integrity of the world's aquatic ecosystems. Large-scale assessments are constrained by the lack of consistency in the indicators used to assess biological integrity and our current inability to translate between indicators. In theory, assessments based on estimates of taxonomic completeness, i.e., the proportion of expected taxa that were observed (observed/expected, O/E). are directly comparable to one another and should therefore allow regionally and globally consistent summaries of the biological integrity of freshwater ecosystems. However, we know little about the true comparability of O/E assessments derived from different data sets or how well O/E assessments perform relative to other indicators in use. I compared the performance (precision, bias, and sensitivity to stressors) of O/E assessments based on five different data sets with the performance of the indicators previously applied to these data (three multimetric indices, a biotic index, and a hybrid method used by the state of Maine). Analyses, were based on data collected from U.S. stream ecosystems in North Carolina, the Mid-Atlantic Highlands, Maine, and Ohio.
   O/E assessments resulted in very similar estimates of mean regional conditions compared with most other indicators once these indicators' values were standardized relative to reference-site means. However, other indicators tended to be biased estimators Of O/E, a consequence of differences in their response to natural environmental gradients and sensitivity to stressors. These results imply that, in some cases, it may be possible to-compare assessments derived from different indicators by standardizing their values (a statistical approach to data harmonization). In situations where it is difficult to standardize or otherwise harmonize two or more indicators, O/E values can easily be derived from existing raw sample data. With some caveats, O/E should provide more directly comparable assessments of biological integrity across regions than is possible by harmonizing values of a mix of indicators.

AB  - Water resource management encompasses a variety of regulations and mandates relevant to water protection and restoration. Awareness of the value-added biological monitoring and assessment to water resource management is increasing worldwide, but especially in countries that have implemented proactive water law and regulatory frameworks for protection of surface waters. Biological communities provide an integrated response to pollutants and human disturbance within watersheds through their continuous exposure to the magnitude, duration, and frequency of stressors, and, thus, are important for assessing ecosystem health. The selection of proper bioindicators can provide additional benefits through their use in causal analysis of impaired waters and measurement of ecosystem recovery after restoration. A process for implementing biological indicators in a monitoring and assessment framework is outlined for managers and practitioners of water resource protection and restoration.

KW  - ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
AB  - There is a difficult polarity between reality and ecologically desirable goals of stream ecosystem management in Switzerland. Most streams are exposed to a variety of impacts. Due to a high intensity of anthropogenic activity there is a high pressure on land and water use. Essential water uses have to be guaranteed. On the other hand there is also a strong need to preserve or restore (bring back ecological integrity) or rehabilitate streams (bring back 'relative ecological integrity'). Stream assessment should, therefore, produce sound data suitable for characterizing the ecological condition of streams and for supporting their sustainable management. The methods should include a system approach as the basic unit and sound scientific principles of ecological integrity emphasizing habitat connectivities. The methods should allow: . the condition of streams to be rationally described and judged, . identification of different kind of impacts on a stream, . verification of the effects of water protection measures, . identification of suitable future actions in the context of a whole stream system. In order to cover the various requirements a modular concept for stream system-oriented analysis was developed. Altogether nine modules are elaborated. Each module deals with specific stream features (two hydrodynamic and ecomorphological modules, five biological modules, two chemical and ecotoxicological modules). Single modules, several modules, or all of them may be applied, depending on the purpose of the analysis. For each module a cost-effective survey procedure (rapid method) and a progressively more rigorous method providing more detailed information is suggested. Based on the result of the analysis, stream rehabilitation concepts can then be elaborated in cooperation with managers, river engineers and biologists.

AB  - Sensitive biological measures of river ecosystem quality are needed to assess, maintain or restore ecological conditions of water bodies. Since our understanding of these complex systems is imperfect, decision-making requires recognizing uncertainty. In this study, a new predictive multi-metric index based on fish functional traits was developed to assess French rivers. Information on fish assemblage structure, local environment and human-induced disturbances of 1654 French river sites was compiled. A Bayesian framework was used to predict theoretical metric values in absence of human pressure and to estimate the uncertainty associated with these predictions. The uncertainty associated with the index score gives the confidence associated with the evaluation of site ecological conditions.
   Among the 228 potential metrics tested, only 11 were retained for the index computation. The final index is independent from natural variability and sensitive to human-induced disturbances. In particular, it is affected by the accumulation of different degradations and specific degradations including hydrological perturbations. Predictive uncertainty is globally lower for IPR+ than for underlying metrics.
   This new methodology seems appropriate to develop bio-indication tools accounting for uncertainty related to reference condition definition and could be extended to other biological groups and areas. Our results support the use of multi-metric indexes to assess rivers and strengthen the idea that examination of uncertainty could contribute greatly to the improvement of the assessment power of bio-indicators.

AB  - Background: Addition of the antioxidant to extender media is the most appropriate attempt to reduce structural losses encounter during the process of cryopreservation. Hence semen excellence could be maintained for longer duration without adverse impact. Additionally antioxidants are not only capturing the reactive oxygen species but also improve the sperm quality indicators and fertility. Accordingly, current elucidation has been executed to explore the dose depended appraisal of varied concentration of alpha-tocopherol in Tris-based extender on frozen-thawed bull semen quality parameters for enhancement of bull semen cryopreservation in the subtropical ecosystem of Peshawar.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Experiments were carried out on semen that has been collected from both Achai-an indigenous breed and Holstein Friesian (HF) - the exotic breed in artificial vagina maintained at 42 degrees C from the experimental bulls of either breed and processed independently breed wise. Semen specimens with above 70% motility were evaluated separately breed-wise under same environmental condition. Standard procedure was adopted to extend the collected semen in the experimental extenders and frozen subsequently. After thawing, further Analysis of the frozen straws of semen was carried out for sperm excellence indicators that include motility, viability, acrosomal integrity and functional integrity of spermatozoa under the subtropical condition. Sperm viability and acrosomal integrity were determined by dual staining procedure i.e. Trypan-blue and Giemsa stains. The hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) test was used to assess plasma membrane integrity. The current elucidation demonstrated that alpha-tocopherol 1.5 mg/mL. supplemented in extender had significantly (P < 0.05) increased sperm excellence gauge that includes motility, viability, acrosomal integrity and functional membrane integrity in both the breeds. On the other hand, the result further elucidated those concentrations higher or lower than 1.5(-1) mg/mL alpha-tocopherol supplemented in the present study resulted in a lower semen functional attributes subsequent to freezing.
   Discussion: Biological samples were preserved by various methods such cryopreservation at low temperature to maintain them intact and facilitate downstream experiments. Antioxidants were associated with the chemical breakage of the substrate consequential from oxidation and counterbalance the free radicals thus diminish the damaging impacts to spermatozoa in cryopreservation. There is lack of data with respect to lipid peroxidation and cell reinforcement limit in cryopreserved semen, and cryopreservation is related with the generation of receptive oxygen species (ROS) which lead to lipid peroxidation (LPO) of sperm membranes, bringing about lost motility, viability and fertility of sperm. Recently, in the reproductive management of the dairy animals, an important focus of research is to overcome the deleterious impact associated with semen cryopreservation. Elucidation of differential dose depended expression of alpha-tocopherol in semen extender has been evident in this study. The results were corroborated with diverse mammalian species under varied ecological management setups. Furthermore the detrimental impact of high doses of alpha-tocopherol in the semen extender has been demonstrated. It was deduced from the current finding that addition of alpha-tocopherol via dose depended approach in Tri extender enhanced the cryosurvivability of both Achai indigenous breed and HF the exotic breed, under existing reproductive management in the local ecosystem of Peshawar.

AB  - Across the country, degradation of freshwater wetlands has prompted a need for science-based methods for assessing and monitoring wetland condition. Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is an assessment that measures the health of an ecosystem. FQA is based on resilience values called Coefficients of Conservatism (C-values), preassigned to each plant species. The method has proven to signal human disturbance in most wetland types, but is understudied in forested wetlands. We compared FQA scores and Ecological Integrity Assessment (EIA) scores (Level 2) of 11 red maple - Sphagnum basin swamps (RMSBS) of New Hampshire and 12 red maple swamps (RMS) of southern Maine to test the hypothesis that FQA signals human disturbance in forested wetlands. EIA did not distinguish RMSMS from RMS, however Mean C, Cover Weighted Mean C (wC), and FQI did. In RMSBS, wC showed the strongest positive correlation with EIA scores. In RMS, Mean C showed the strongest positive correlation with EIA scores. For all sites combined, wC and Mean C were significantly correlated with EIA scores. Meaningful relationships were not observed between FQI or wFQI and EIA scores. The results indicate that Mean C and wC offer a reliable metrics for the evaluation of forested wetlands in northern New England.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify a practical and defensible set of ecosystem attributes to form the basis of natural variability benchmarks for natural resource managers needing to determine the status of patch-scale species-level biodiversity within woodland and forest ecosystems. We used a form of multicriteria analysis (the analytic hierarchy process, AHP) to record and analyse the knowledge and opinions of 31 Australian ecologists on those ecosystem attributes considered most important as biodiversity surrogates, and those that were considered most feasible to assess. From a pool of 13 landscape context attributes and 62 vegetation condition attributes, practical and defensible attribute sets were identified based on AHP importance and feasibility weights and associated statistical analyses. Experts considered that, on average, landscape context attributes should contribute approximately one-third (0.36) to an assessment of within-vegetation-type species-level biodiversity status, and vegetation condition attributes should contribute the remaining two-thirds (0.64). Our analyses did, however, find a correlation between these importance weights and the spatial scales at which experts worked. The landscape context attributes: patch size, distance to nearest large patch, and connectivity were considered significantly more important than other attributes; however, connectivity received a significantly lower feasibility weight. A minimum set of 11 compositional, structural and functional vegetation condition attributes were identified: richness of native trees; cover of native trees, shrubs and perennial grasses; cover of exotic shrubs, perennial grasses, legumes and forbs; cover of organic litter; recruitment of native tree/shrub saplings; native tree health; and evidence of grazing. We compare our minimum sets of attributes with other published sets, and briefly discuss the issues surrounding the incorporation of attributes into natural variability benchmarks from which indices of terrestrial species-level biodiversity status of woodland and forest patches can be determined.

AB  - Aquatic and riparian plant species were examined in order to propose a multimetric plant index to assess the biotic integrity in Iberian rivers. An additional analysis with two other plant indices was performed to evaluate the present approach. A floristic survey was undertaken during May and early June 2000 in southern Iberian rivers. After the identification of two vegetation types, a partial canonical correspondence analysis of the floristic data with anthropogenic variables permited the recognition of the least perturbed sites, using the environmental characteristics as co-variables to account for natural site variability. From the 22 candidate-metrics, 8 were selected for inclusion on the final multimetric index: 3 representing composition measures (number of riparian and aquatic species, and number of annual species), 3 reflecting direct human-disturbances (abundance of Arundo donax, number of exotic, ruderal species), 1 trophic measure (number of nitrophyllous species) and 1 related with the riparian integrity (relative riparian width). Quality outputs were correlated with a global disturbance measure in order to evaluate the index performance and compared with the results of other plant indices. The Iberian multimetric plant index (IMPI) displayed a promising ability to relate riparian vegetation features to the current range of global disturbance. The IMPI will need to be further validated, with an enlarged set of metrics and a wider geographical area with clearly unimpaired reference sites in each vegetation type. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Assessing the biological integrity of aquatic habitats often requires a comparison of observed conditions with those conditions expected to occur in the absence of human-generated stress. Using data from least impaired lakes, models were developed to predict the macroinvertebrate community composition of stony littoral habitats of relatively small (median surface area = 0.26 km(2)) boreal lakes. In brief, three steps were used in model calibration: (i) identification of biological groups by clustering, (ii) selection of environmental variables that explain among-group variance using ordination, and (iii) model calibration using discriminant function analysis. RIVPACS-type predictive models were individually developed for the three major regions of Sweden; namely, the mixed forest, coniferous forest and arctic/alpine regions. Geographic position (latitude, longitude, altitude) and variables indicative of substratum (e.g. cobble and vegetation type) and water color were often found to discriminate among-group variance and were used in model calibrations. The lowest errors associated with observed to expected (O/E) scores for taxon richness were found for models developed for the mixed forest region (mean O/E score = 0.997 +/- 0.254, CV = 25.5%), and the highest errors were associated with models developed for the arctic/alpine region ((mean O/E score = 1.011 +/- 0.337, CV = 33.3%). The use of RIVPACS-type models in ecological assessment is increasing, principally because the site-specific predictions that are produced are intuitive and rather straightforward. This study shows that the RIVPACS approach may be used for assessing and monitoring the ecological quality of boreal lake ecosystems using littoral macroinvertebrate communities.

AB  - The species composition of benthic diatoms was related to environmental conditions in streams throughout the western US to develop diatom traits, indicators for assessment of biological condition and indicators for diagnosing stressors. We hypothesized that indicators based on species traits determined for subsets of streams with similar natural landscape features would be more precisely related to environmental conditions than would be indicators calculated based on species traits for all Streams in the data set. The ranges of many environmental conditions were wide among western streams, and these conditions covaried greatly along a major environmental gradient characterized by positive correlations among % watershed disturbed by agricultural and urban land uses (% WD), conductivity, total N, total P, and % fine sediments. Species traits were calculated for 242 diatom taxa. Weighted average (WA) methods were used to define species environmental optima, and regression approaches were used to determine whether species were sensitive or tolerant to environmental conditions indicated by % WD, total P, total N, a nutrient multivariate index, pH, conductivity, % fine sediments, % embeddedness, and a watershed disturbance multivariate index. Indicators based on WA optima and sensitive/tolerant traits were highly correlated with these environmental conditions. Natural and anthropogenic conditions varied greatly among classes of streams grouped by climate regions, but indicators developed for the entire western US were consistently more accurate than were regional indicators. Indicators for individual stressors, such as total P, conductivity, and % embeddedness, were highly correlated with values of respective stressors, but covariation among all indicators and stressors indicated that only 1 environmental gradient was reliably reflected by the indicators. Thus, robust indicators of the biological condition of diatom assemblages were developed for streams of the western US, but development of stressor-specific indicators will require application of additional analytical approaches.

AB  - In-place analysis for offshore platforms is essentially required to make proper design for new structures and true assessment for existing structures. The structural integrity of platform components under the maximum and minimum operating loads of environmental conditions is required for risk assessment and inspection plan development. In-place analyses have been executed to check that the structural member with all appurtenances has robustness and capability to support the applied loads in either storm condition or operating condition. A nonlinear finite element analysis is adopted for the platform structure above the seabed and the soil-pile-jacket interaction to estimate the in-place behavior of a typical fixed offshore platform. The analysis includes an interpretation of the dynamic design parameters based on the available site-specific data, together with foundation design recommendations for in-place loading conditions. The SACS software is utilized to calculate the natural frequencies, dynamic amplification factors, and the stresses at selected members, as well as their nodal displacements. The directions of environmental loads and water depth variations have important effects on the results of the in-place analysis behavior. The incidence angle of seismic waves is an essential parameter, where, for some crucial angles, the internal forces and the maximum deformations can be doubled or more in comparison with the ones corresponding to other, less crucial angles. Therefore, the incidence angle considerably affects the response quantities. The results confirm that the in-place analysis is quite essential for the reliable design of new offshore platforms and the assessment of existing offshore structures.

AB  - This paper reports the assessment of the ecological integrity of streams in Bregalnica River Basin with emphasis on river Bregalnica as the biggest and most important watercourse in Eastern Macedonia. The results have principally been derived from remote sensing data and set up in a model build up on Watershed Habitat Evaluation and Stream Integrity Protocol (WHEBIP). WHEBIP effectiveness in predicting ecological integrity of streams has been assessed by correlation analyses derived upon data on macroinvertebrate biotic indices and physico-chemical parameters on 35 localities throughout the basin. The statistical analyses confirmed the capacity of WHEBIP to predict stream site-specific features with great accuracy in the case of Bregalnica.
   The results obtained in this study contribute towards the improvement of the WHEBIP protocol and in general, promotes applicability of stream integrity assessment tools in setting priorities for integrated watershed management.

AB  - Longitudinal zonation concepts describe the downstream changes in chemico-physical and biological properties of rivers. Including information on ecological fish guilds can enhance the usefulness of fish zonation concepts, in a way that they can be used as tools for assessment and management of the ecological integrity of large rivers. We present an ecological characterization of fish zones and fish communities in near-natural and in regulated large rivers in Europe ( the River Doubs in France and the Rivers Rhine and Meuse in the Netherlands), using guild classifications of several life-history traits of fish and national Red Lists of threatened species. The Doubs data set was also analyzed using indices of the sensitivity of fish species to environmental degradation and indices for eurytopy. In these rivers, the number of ecological guilds per zone increases downstream, and there are clear shifts in the structure of the guilds. Flow preference and reproduction ecology of river fish are closely linked. The proportion of rheophilic species in the fish community decreases downstream, and the proportions of limnophilic and eurytopic species increase. Lithophilic and psammophilic spawners are dominant in the upper zones, whereas the lower zones are dominated by phytophilic and phytolithophilic spawners. The proportion of zoobenthivorous and periphytivorous species decreases downstream, and the proportion of zooplanktivorous and phytivorous species increases. However, because the European fish fauna mainly consists of feeding generalists, the discriminative abilities of simplistic feeding guild classifications are not very high. Guilds of sensitive, stenoecious species that share life history strategies that are highly adapted to specific riverine conditions ( rheophils and limnophils) have declined far more than generalist species that can survive in a wide range of habitats that are not characteristic of natural river ecosystems. Because of the subsequent over-abundance of the eurytopic species the original longitudinal fish zonations are hardly recognizable anymore in heavily impacted large rivers such as the River Rhine. Hence these rivers do not meet the criteria for ecological integrity. Within a specific fish region, a suitable way of analyzing and monitoring the impact of human disturbance on the structure of the fish community is by comparing the guild structure of the present state of a fish zone with that of the reference situation.

AB  - Landscape transformation and subsequent habitat loss locally extirpate populations and threaten ecosystem health. Timber plantations are a major threat to grassland ecosystems globally. An effective mitigation measure is the instigation of webs of large conservation corridors as ecological networks in plantation mosaics. These ecological networks incorporate natural water courses along with their matrices of natural grassland. Dragonflies are highly sensitive to habitat condition and are effective bioindicators of water quality. Here, we compare dragonfly diversity in conservation corridors, with nearby protected areas as controls, to determine the effectiveness of ecological networks for maintaining river ecosystem integrity, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. We also investigate the effect of ecological network corridor width on dragonfly assemblages. Lastly, we explore the importance of 18 environmental variables as drivers of dragonfly diversity. Dragonfly abundance, species richness, and Dragonfly Biotic Index scores (a scoring system based on dragonfly range of extent, threat status, and environmental sensitivity) did not differ between ecological network and protected area sites. Dragonfly abundance and species richness were positively correlated with ecological network corridor width. Landscape and water variables were the most important drivers of dragonfly assemblage composition in both ecological networks and protected areas. Management variables and those related to anthropogenic disturbance were not as important. This highlights the conservation success of these well-managed ecological networks for maintaining dragonfly biodiversity in forestry plantations, provided that corridors are wide enough. Implementation of ecological networks as a mitigation measure for plantation forestry is highly effective for lotic systems, and should be implemented more widely in environmental protection plans for transformed landscapes.

AB  - Indicators of ecological health based on biological communities, including numerous multimetric indices, are used worldwide to assess and report the condition of aquatic ecosystems such as estuaries. Yet, these tools have rarely been applied to support estuary management in Australia. We present a case study of one such multimetric indicator, the Fish Community Index (FCI), which was developed and applied to quantify the ecological condition of estuaries in southwestern Australia (SWA). We outline the rationale, development, and implementation of the FCI for annual monitoring and reporting of the ecological condition of a highly urbanized estuary, highlighting the key research and management outcomes that it has delivered, and evaluating its potential future applications to support estuary management more broadly, both across Australia and internationally. The FCI is founded upon a conceptually simple and scientifically robust rationale and is sensitive to the ecological stressors that affect many estuaries across the region (e.g., hypoxia, algal blooms). Together with an accompanying annual fish monitoring regime, the FCI provides managers with a consistent, robust basis for quantifying and reporting spatiotemporal changes in estuary condition, with easily comprehensible outputs that facilitate communication with stakeholders, ranging from politicians to the general public. We attribute the successful implementation of this management tool to several characteristics, namely 1) support from a long-term, collaborative partnership between managers and researchers; 2) comprehensive testing and validation of the index prior to implementation; 3) a robust, standardized monitoring regime; and 4) sustained resourcing from managers to implement the index as part of a reporting framework. The FCI has also been applied to other SWA estuaries and could provide a platform for more coordinated assessment and reporting of estuarine condition at the bioregional scale, thereby helping to improve the gap in reporting on the biotic integrity of Australian estuaries.

AB  - Conceptual models are an integral facet of long-term monitoring programs. Proposed linkages between drivers, stressors, and ecological indicators are identified within the conceptual model of most mandated programs. We empirically evaluate a conceptual model developed for a regional aquatic and riparian monitoring program using causal models (i.e., Bayesian path analysis). We assess whether data gathered for regional status and trend estimation can also provide insights on why a stream may deviate from reference conditions. We target the hypothesized causal pathways for how anthropogenic drivers of road density, percent grazing, and percent forest within a catchment affect instream biological condition. We found instream temperature and fine sediments in arid sites and only fine sediments in mesic sites accounted for a significant portion of the maximum possible variation explainable in biological condition among managed sites. However, the biological significance of the direct effects of anthropogenic drivers on instream temperature and fine sediments were minimal or not detected. Consequently, there was weak to no biological support for causal pathways related to anthropogenic drivers' impact on biological condition. With weak biological and statistical effect sizes, ignoring environmental contextual variables and covariates that explain natural heterogeneity would have resulted in no evidence of human impacts on biological integrity in some instances. For programs targeting the effects of anthropogenic activities, it is imperative to identify both land use practices and mechanisms that have led to degraded conditions (i.e., moving beyond simple status and trend estimation). Our empirical evaluation of the conceptual model underpinning the long-term monitoring program provided an opportunity for learning and, consequently, we discuss survey design elements that require modification to achieve question driven monitoring, a necessary step in the practice of adaptive monitoring. We suspect our situation is not unique and many programs may suffer from the same inferential disconnect. Commonly, the survey design is optimized for robust estimates of regional status and trend detection and not necessarily to provide statistical inferences on the causal mechanisms outlined in the conceptual model, even though these relationships are typically used to justify and promote the long-term monitoring of a chosen ecological indicator. Our application demonstrates a process for empirical evaluation of conceptual models and exemplifies the need for such interim assessments in order for programs to evolve and persist.

AB  - Faunal assemblages and multi scale habitat patterns in headwater tributaries of the South Fork Trinity River an unregulated river embedded within a multiple use landscape. Headwaters can represent 80% of stream kilometers in a watershed, and they also have unique physical and biological properties that have only recently been recognized for their importance in sustaining healthy functioning stream networks and their ecological services. We sampled 60 headwater tributaries in the South Fork Trinity River, a 2,430 km(2), mostly forested, multiple use watershed in northwestern California. Our objectives were: (1) to differentiate unique headwater types using 69 abiotic and vegetation variables measured at three spatial scales, and then to reduce these to informative subsets; (2) determine if distinct biota occupied the different tributary types; (3) determine the environmental attributes associated with the presence and abundance of these biotic assemblages; and (4) using niche modeling, determine key attribute thresholds to illustrate how these biota could be employed as metrics of system integrity and ecological services. Several taxa were sufficiently abundant and widespread to use as bio-indicators: the presence and abundance of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), herpetofauna (reptile and amphibian) species richness, and signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) represented different trophic positions, value as commercial resources (steelhead), sensitivity to environmental stress (amphibians), and indicators of biodiversity (herpetofauna species richness). Herpetofauna species richness did not differ, but abundances of steelhead trout, signal crayfish, and amphibian richness all differed significantly among tributary types. Niche models indicated that distribution and abundance patterns in both riparian and aquatic environments were associated with physical and structural attributes at multiple spatial scales, both within and around reaches. The bio-indicators responded to unique sets of attributes, reflecting the high environmental heterogeneity in headwater tributaries across this large watershed. These niche attributes represented a wide range of headwater environments, indicating responses to a number of natural and anthropogenic conditions, and demonstrated the value of using a suite of bio indicators to elucidate watershed conditions, and to examine numerous disturbances that may influence ecological integrity.

AB  - Ecosystem monitoring is a key priority for evaluating ecosystem conditions, but high costs, especially with regard to marine ecosystems, hamper its large-scale implementation. Despite a wide range of monitoring programs for tropical coral reefs, it has not been possible to establish a minimum set of the most relevant metrics. This leads to heterogeneous methods, the collection of different metrics that are difficult to compare and lengthy, time- and money-consuming surveys. In the present study, we use ecosystem integrity as an underlying conceptual framework to establish a minimum set of metrics for evaluating the ecosystem condition of Caribbean coral reefs. We reviewed ten existing monitoring protocols for their conceptual framework, metrics used, their reference ranges and sampling methods and documented the ecological relevance of indicators, as reported in the literature. Of the 64 in situ metrics, 15 with high ecological relevance were selected as a minimum set, covering aspects of composition (Hill numbers for corals and fish), structure (coral, red algae, macroalgae and filamentous algae cover, topographic complexity, and habitat extent) and function (recruit density, disease and bleaching incidence, fish biomass, and filamentous and macroalgae height) of coral reefs across a range of ecological scales. Besides the lack of underlying conceptual frameworks and reference levels for specific regions in existing monitoring protocols, landscape scale and connectivity metrics are also missing, producing negative impacts on indicator interpretation. The presented indicator framework constitutes a valuable guideline, as it documents the most relevant metrics for ecosystem condition, considering composition, structure, and function.

AB  - Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has resulted in a change in seawater chemistry and lowering of pH, referred to as ocean acidification. Understanding how different organisms and processes respond to ocean acidification is vital to predict how marine ecosystems will be altered under future scenarios of continued environmental change. Regenerative processes involving biomineralization in marine calcifiers such as sea urchins are predicted to be especially vulnerable. In this study, the effect of ocean acidification on regeneration of external appendages (spines and tube feet) was investigated in the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus exposed to ambient (546 mu atm), intermediate (1027 mu atm) and high (1841 mu atm) partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) for eight weeks. The rate of regeneration was maintained in spines and tube feet throughout two periods of amputation and regrowth under conditions of elevated pCO(2). Increased expression of several biomineralization-related genes indicated molecular compensatory mechanisms; however, the structural integrity of both regenerating and homeostatic spines was compromised in high pCO(2) conditions. Indicators of physiological fitness (righting response, growth rate, coelomocyte concentration and composition) were not affected by increasing pCO(2), but compromised spine integrity is likely to have negative consequences for defence capabilities and therefore survival of these ecologically and economically important organisms.

AB  - Biological metrics are increasingly employed by regulatory agencies to assess ecosystem condition for the purposes of conservation, restoration, mitigation and creation. While indices of biotic integrity (IBI) have been shown to correspond strongly with anthropogenic disturbance, they are time consuming and expensive to implement and require advanced taxonomic knowledge. Regulatory implementation frequently necessitates simplified indicators of community composition that do not excessively sacrifice ecological specificity. Detailed observations of vegetative community composition and structure in isolated depressional herbaceous (n = 75) and forested (n = 118) wetlands were undertaken to identify integrative biotic metrics of community condition. Habitat-specific wetland condition indices (WCI) composed of five to six relativized biotic metrics (% non-native plant species, % tolerant and % sensitive plant species, perennial-to-annual/biennial ratio, mean floristic quality, species hydric status) were previously developed. From these quantitative indices of condition, classification (CT) and regression tree (RT) models were developed for categorical/continuous prediction based on presence/absence data for species and ecologically appropriate groups of species. Optimal categorical resolution with respect to model validation accuracy was achieved for three impact categories (minimally, moderately, and severely disturbed). Overall cross-validation efficiencies were 77% and 74% for herbaceous and forested wetlands, respectively. Error was primarily observed in the moderate degradation class for both systems and misclassified sites tended to fall near categorical threshold values. High validation specificity was observed for severely degraded sites (89% for both systems) and minimally impacted sites (> 90% for both systems). The advantages of CT models for regulatory application include interpretive simplicity, ecological specificity, standardized repeatable assessment between assessors, and reduced botanical expertise requirements.

AB  - The biological condition gradient (BCG), a scientific framework that describes the change in ecosystem characteristics in response to human-induced levels of stressors, was modified and used to characterize watershed habitats in the Upper Tana River watershed, Kenya. The inbuilt utilities of BCG, including its simplicity, versatility, and its robust nature, allowed its use by seven taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates, diatoms, fish, herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles), plants, macrofungi, and birds to assess and monitor landscape conditions in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The biological data were described using taxa abundance distribution measures followed by multivariate analyses to determine their relationship with water or soil quality and thereafter assessment of taxa tolerant levels in response to environmental stress and disturbances. Preliminary findings reported that the taxonomic groups complemented each other, with each taxonomic group reliably assessing ecological conditions to a certain degree that supported assigning all 36 sampled sites into BCG tiers. The BCG models developed for all taxonomic groups assisted in the identification and selection of taxa indicating varying levels of landscape conditions. These taxa, referred to as flagship or indicator taxa, assist in simplifying the BCG model and, hence, are possible for use by parataxonomists or ordinary citizens to assess and monitor the ecological health of habitats under consideration. Furthermore, the capability of BCG models to assess landscape conditions shows how they can be used to identify important habitats for conservation, direct investment for restoration, and track progress.

AB  - Human exploitation and use of marine and coastal areas are apparent and growing in many regions of the world. For instance, fishery, shipping, military, raw material exploitation, nature protection and the rapidly expanding offshore wind power technology are competing for limited resources and space. The development and implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) strategies could help to solve these problems. Therefore, suitable spatial assessment, modeling, planning and management tools are urgently needed. These tools have to deal with data that include complex information on different spatial and temporal scales. A systematic approach based on the development of future scenarios which are assessed by combining different simulation models, GIS methods and an integrating set of ecological integrity indicators, was applied in a case study in the German North Sea. Here, the installation of huge offshore wind parks within the near future is planned. The aim was to model environmental effects of altered sea-use patterns on marine biota. Indicators of ecological integrity were used to assess altering conditions and possible ecosystem shifts ranging from systems' degradations to the development of highly productive and diverse artificial reef systems. The results showed that some ecosystem processes and properties and related indicators are sensitive to changes generated by offshore wind park installations while others did not react as hypothesized.

AB  - I review the distribution of ant genera in cold biomes of the northern hemisphere, and discuss opportunities and challenges in using ants as environmental, ecological, and biodiversity indicators in these biomes. I present five propositions that, if supported with future research, would allow ants to be used as biological indicators in north-temperate cold biomes: (1) Distribution of individual species or species groups are leading (early-warning) indicators of climatic warming at tundra / taiga or taiga / broadleaf forest boundaries; (2) mound-building species in the Formica rufa LINNAEUS, 1761 group are ecological indicators for land-use changes in European taiga and broadleaf forests; (3) relative abundance (evenness) is a leading indicator of environmental changes whereas high species richness is an indicator of past or ongoing disturbance; (4) presence of social parasites and slave-making species are better indicators of ecological integrity than presence or abundance of their hosts alone; (5) occurrence of non-native or invasive species is an indicator of reduced ecological integrity. Important aspects of long-term sampling, surveying, monitoring, and experimenting on ants are discussed in light of future research needs to test these propositions and to further develop ants as indicators of changing environmental conditions in north-temperate cold biomes.

AB  - 1. The need for sensitive biological measures of aquatic ecosystem integrity applicable at large spatial scales has been highlighted by the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive. Using fish communities as indicators of habitat quality in rivers, we developed a multi-metric index to test our capacity to (i) correctly model a variety of metrics based on assemblage structure and functions, and (ii) discriminate between the effects of natural vs. human-induced environmental variability at a continental scale.
   2. Information was collected for 5252 sites distributed among 1843 European rivers. Data included variables on fish assemblage structure, local environmental variables, sampling strategy and a river basin classification based on native fish fauna similarities accounting for regional effects on local assemblage structure. Fifty-eight metrics reflecting different aspects of fish assemblage structure and function were selected from the available literature and tested for their potential to indicate habitat degradation.
   3. To quantify possible deviation from a 'reference condition' for any given site, we first established and validated statistical models describing metric responses to natural environmental variability in the absence of any significant human disturbance. We considered that the residual distributions of these models described the response range of each metric, whatever the natural environmental variability. After testing the sensitivity of these residuals to a gradient of human disturbance, we finally selected 10 metrics that were combined to obtain a European fish assemblage index. We demonstrated that (i) when considering only minimally disturbed sites the index remains invariant, regardless of environmental variability, and (ii) the index shows a significant negative linear response to a gradient of human disturbance.
   4. Synthesis and applications. In this reference condition modelling approach, by including a more complete description of environmental variability at both local and regional scales it was possible to develop a novel fish biotic index transferable between catchments at the European scale. The use of functional metrics based on biological attributes of species instead of metrics based on species themselves reduced the index sensitivity to the variability of fish fauna across different biogeographical areas.

AB  - Implementing a statistically valid and practical monitoring design for large-scale stream condition monitoring and assessment programs can be difficult due to factors including the likely existence of a diversity of ecosystem types such as ephemeral streams over the sampling domain; limited resources to undertake detailed monitoring surveys and address knowledge gaps; and operational constraints on effective sampling at monitoring sites. In statistical speak, these issues translate to defining appropriate target populations and sampling units; designing appropriate spatial and temporal sample site selection methods; selection and use of appropriate indicators; and setting effect sizes with limited ecological and statistical information about the indicators of interest. We identify the statistical and operational challenges in designing large-scale stream condition surveys and discuss general approaches for addressing them. The ultimate aim in drawing attention to these challenges is to ensure operational practicality in carrying out future monitoring programs and that the resulting inferences about stream condition are statistically valid and relevant.

AB  - Environmental agencies across the United States have searched for adequate methods to assess anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Biological assessments, which compare the taxonomic composition of an aquatic assemblage to relevant biocriteria, have surfaced as an effective method to assess the ecological integrity of US waterbodies. In this study, bioassessment data were collected and analyzed in conjunction with physical habitat and chemical stressor data for streams and rivers within the San Diego basin from 1998 through 2005. Physical stressors such as sediment loading, riparian destruction, and in-stream habitat homogenization affect many locations in the region. However, physical habitat measures alone were found to frequently overestimate the biological integrity of streams in the region. Many sites within the San Diego Basin, although unaffected by physical stressors, continue to exhibit low biological integrity scores. Sites with low biological integrity tend to possess higher specific conductance and salinity compared to sites with high biological integrity. We suggest that one possible reason for these differences is the source water used for municipal purposes.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are considered as a representative taxon that indicates the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems. Numerous indices derived from community data have been proposed to estimate either biological water quality or ecosystem health. In this study, metrics based on benthic macroinvertebrates at the family level were screened using ecological informatics to provide a multi-metric measurement that would be suitable for presenting ecological integrity across different levels of environmental impact. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at a total of 720 sample sites from river basins and streams in Korea in 2009. Based on four categories of community status (i.e., diversity, richness, tolerance, and composition), 37 metrics were selected as initial candidates according to the literature. The candidate metrics were evaluated according to parameters including discriminatory power, redundancy, and responsiveness to stressors. Self-organizing map was utilized to assist the screening procedure by providing ordination, clustering, and visualization of metric and environmental data. Six metrics were finally selected as a multi-metric and were compared with conventional indicators for presenting the ecological integrity of streams.

AB  - Input- and output-oriented approaches to landscape management have distinct roles for resource protection, environmental restoration, and sustainable land management. Implementing recent proposals for ecosystem management in the western United States involves a synthesis of input and output management. Within the broader context of ecosystem management, input management focuses on tailoring land use to the landscape, whereas output management employs assessments of resource condition to trigger modified management activity once resources are degraded to specified threshold conditions. Current approaches to landscape-scale management, however, tend to rely primarily on output-oriented strategies that are most effective for monitoring environmental conditions. Current uses of input management focus on environmental impact assessments, which generally are site- or project-specific analyses. The complexity and dynamic nature of ecosystems, and the range of scales over which ecological processes operate, imply that development and incorporation of input-oriented approaches into landscape-scale management is necessary to implement ecosystem management as a strategy for sustainable land use.

AB  - We implemented an integrated ecological assessment using a GIS-based decision support system model for Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River (UPDE) and Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DEWA)-national park units with the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Our assessment examined a variety of aquatic and terrestrial indicators of ecosystem components that reflect the parks' conservation purpose and reference condition. Our assessment compared these indicators to ecological thresholds to determine the condition of park watersheds. Selected indicators included chemical and physical measures of water quality, biologic indicators of water quality, and landscape condition measures. For the chemical and physical measures of water quality, we used a water quality index and each of its nine components to assess the condition of water quality in each watershed. For biologic measures of water quality, we used the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera aquatic macroinvertebrate index and, secondarily, the Hilsenhoff aquatic macroinvertebrate index. Finally, for the landscape condition measures of our model, we used percent forest and percent impervious surface. Based on our overall assessment, UPDE and DEWA watersheds had an ecological assessment score of 0.433 on a -1 to 1 fuzzy logic scale. This score indicates that, in general, the natural resource condition within watersheds at these parks is healthy or ecologically unimpaired; however, we had only partial data for many of our indicators. Our model is iterative and new data may be incorporated as they become available. These natural parks are located within a rapidly urbanizing landscape-we recommend that natural resource managers remain vigilant to surrounding land uses that may adversely affect natural resources within the parks.

AB  - The use of a diffusion sampler made from regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane was investigated in this study to resolve issues from previous studies on the integrity of the sampler when deployed in the field. The dialysis samplers were deployed in monitoring wells at two upstream oil- and gas-contaminated sites. The average ambient temperature in the monitoring wells was 4 +/- 1 degrees C over the 6 month duration of the test. Burst pressure and tensile strength tests were used to determine the integrity of the samplers at two field sites over time. The test results showed no adverse impacts on the samplers' integrity after 6 months. Therefore, diffusion samplers from regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane show promising results when used for long-term monitoring associated with natural attenuation assessment under the conditions tested.

AB  - The integrity of coastal salt marshes can be determined from the extent to which they provide key ecosystem services: food and habitat for fish and wildlife, good water quality, erosion and flood control, and recreation and cultural use. An outline of a new approach for linking ecosystem services with metrics of structure and function to evaluate the ecological integrity of salt marshes is described. One main objective of the approach is to determine whether differences in structure and function can be detected among salt marshes with similar geomorphology and hydrology but different degrees of anthropogenic stress. The approach is currently being applied to salt marshes of Narragansett Bay, RI, USA. Stable nitrogen isotopic ratios of the marsh biota reflected the nitrogen sources from the adjacent watersheds and were significantly correlated with percent residential land use. Results show that plant zonation significantly (r = -0.82; p<0.05) relates with percent residential land use and is potentially a sensitive indicator of anthropogenic disturbance of New England salt marshes. We are currently examining species diversity, denitrification rates, and susceptibility to erosion among the sites for additional indicators of salt marsh condition. Our results to date suggest that this approach will provide the methods needed for managers to systematically monitor and evaluate the integrity of salt marshes.

AB  - This paper critically reviews developments in the conceptualization and elaboration of the River Ecosystem Health (REH) concept. Analysis of literature shows there is still no consistent meaning of the central concept Ecosystem Health, resulting in models (i.e. elaborations) that have unclear and insufficient conceptual grounds. Furthermore, a diverse terminology is associated with describing REH, resulting in confusion with other concepts. However, if the concept is to have merit and longevity in the field of river research and management, unambiguous definition of the conceptual meaning and operational domain are required. Therefore a redefinition is proposed, based on identified characteristics of health and derived from considering semantic and conceptual definitions. Based on this definition, REH has merit in a broader context of river system health that considers societal functioning next to ecological functioning. Assessment of health needs integration of measures of multiple, complementary attributes and analysis in a synthesized way. An assessment framework is proposed that assesses REH top-down as well as bottom up by combining indicators of system stress responses (i.e. condition) with indicators identifying the causative stress (i.e. stressor). The scope of REH is covered by using indicators of system activity, metabolism (vigour), resilience, structure and interactions between system components (organization). The variety of stress effects that the system may endure are covered by using biotic, chemical as well as physical stressors. Besides having a unique meaning, the REH metaphor has added value to river management by being able to mobilize scientists, practitioners and publics and seeing relationships at the level of values. It places humans at the centre of the river ecosystem, while seeking to ensure the durability of the ecosystem of which they are an integral part. Optimization of the indicator set, development of aggregation and classification methodologies, and implementation of the concept within differing international frames are considered main aims for future research.

AB  - Increasingly on a worldwide scale, legislation has been adopted to determine the ecological integrity of surface waters including streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters. An integral part of determining ecological integrity is the measurement of biological integrity, typically emphasizing analyses of plankton, benthos, macroalgae and fish. In the development of protocols for evaluating biological integrity, benthic macroinvertebrate communities are the most consistently emphasized biotic component of aquatic ecosystems. A plethora of methodologies with hundreds of indices, metrics and evaluation tools are presently available. An ecologically parsimonious approach dictates that investigators should place greater emphasis on evaluating the suitability of indices that already exist prior to developing new ones. Hence, the authors organized within the American Society of Limnology and oceanography 2006 Summer Meeting, 4-9 June 2006, in Victoria, BC, Canada, a special session with the objective to compare methodologies, applications and interpretations existing in various countries and attempting to contribute to an improved understanding of the suitability of such approaches when using benthic communities. From the 25 contributions presented in this session, eight manuscripts were selected to be included in this special issue of Ecological Indicators including new index development, novel validation approaches, assessment of spatio-temporal applications, interpretations relative to management needs and potential adaptive management modifications to maximize the robustness, sensitivity, and representativeness of environmental information conveyed to management.

AB  - Maintaining natural hydrologic variability is essential in conserving native riverine biota and river ecosystem integrity. Hydrologic regimes play a major role in structuring the biotic diversity within river ecosystems, as they control key habitat conditions within the river channel, the floodplain, etc. Alterations in strearnflow regimes may modify many of these habitat attributes and impair ecosystem connectivity. There are many dams constructed in the Huaihe River basin that are drastically altering the natural hydrologic regimes of the river. We selected the Bengbu Sluice as a control node to study the influence of the Bengbu Sluice and all its upstream dams on the hydrologic regime. Using Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration and Range ofVariability Approach methods, we assessed hydrologic alteration at the strearngauge site to demonstrate the influence of dams on ecohydrological conditions in the Huaihe Riverbasin. The results show that dams have a stronginfluence on ecohydrologiCal conditions, especially in dry seasons. The river ecohydrological targets and the minimum ecological and environmental flow requirements for the Benglou section defined by this study can support ecosystem management and restoration plans and provide ecological operations for the Bengbu Sluice. @ 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The EU's Water Framework Directive (WFD) in particular makes good use of riverine biota-including fish-as ecological indicators of river integrity. However, it is also important to examine when our indicators fail to serve the purpose for which they were originally intended: to consistently and reliably describe the quality of the environment. We argue that in the Czech Republic (and probably several other European countries), the use of adult fish as ecological indicators often fails to fulfill these purposes for several reasons, especially when fish are stocked in natural waters, for practical considerations during field sampling, and problems with public relations. The ecological quality of running waters sensu WFD is usually assessed on the basis of the adult fish assemblage. The aim of this study is to describe disadvantages of monitoring river integrity using adult fish in Czech Republic, which has regular and widespread stocking of more than one-third of fish species present in running waters and to suggest the alternative strategy of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish monitoring for assessing river ecological quality with the ability to provide a sensitive response to water quality and habitat structure regardless of the effect of stocking or river size. We conclude that even though YOY sampling is often a more logical and practical approach to water quality monitoring under specific conditions, no method is perfect and caution should be taken. For example, YOY can have high annual variability in density and higher sensitivity to summer flood events than adults. The suitable time for sampling YOY fishes in late summer is much shorter than for the adult fish community, and therefore must be considered when designing a successful monitoring strategy. Monitoring of YOY fishes does not provide direct information about age structure of fish populations, which is required by WFD. YOY sampling is a useful-albeit imperfect-method for providing a sensitive response to ecological status of rivers, especially under specific stocking conditions.

AB  - Large river systems are some of the most important aquatic resource for human beings. Unfortunately, ecological integrity of large rivers has been altered severely by human activities. To monitor and manage these ecosystems, a large number of fish-based indexes, especially at community-level have been developed in the past decades. However, community-level methods have presented unique challenges in large river assessment. Comparatively, the population-level method could not only avoid the challenges, but also show many other advantages. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop and validate a population-based method applicable for large river. The present study was carried out at the Dongjiang River, with Xenocypris davidi and Hemibarbus labeo being selected as the sentinel indicators. In developing our method we sought population metrics, including growth, survival and reproduction related, to reflect ecological characteristics. Candidate biological metrics were screened for stability, responsiveness and redundancy. The metrics of standard length, average age and fecundity were finally selected for X. davidi, and standard length, weight, average age, and gonadosomatic index for H. labeo. Through the relationship between biological traits and catchments human disturbance information, Xunwu and Anyuan were ultimately chosen as the reference sites for X. davidi and H. labeo, respectively. The star plot areas, representing the degree of similarity with the reference conditions, showed a large variation among different sampling sites, ranging from 0.15 to 0.94 for X. davidi and 0.13 to 1.91 for H. labeo. It was indicated that all sampling sites except for XW could be assigned to the "impaired". The publicly available census data were used as independent data set to validate our method. The high agreement of both methods suggested that our method could provide an accurate measure for river ecosystem condition. We believe our methodology would be helpful for water resource management of large river. The methodology established here may also serve as a reference of how to develop a population-based index for similar assessments in other large river systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

CP  - 3rd Symposium on the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
AB  - We used methods from EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) to assess the regional status of streams within the Coast Range ecoregion of Washington State. Study objectives were: to determine the ecological condition of wadable, Ist-order through 3rd-order streams; to provide information for the development of water quality biological criteria; and to determine the applicability of EMAP-derived methods in Washington. Stream condition was assessed using EMAP indicators for habitat (chemical and physical) and biology (invertebrate and vertebrate assemblages). EMAP's probability survey was used to select 75 Ist through 3rd-order stream sites from the USGS 1:100,000 series hydrographic layer. Of these, 45 sites were sampled. Multivariate techniques were used to identify community types and related physical and chemical habitat. Overall, about 25% of the sites were rated least-impacted. Most impacts were associated with non-point source pollution, mainly forestry practices. The R-EMAP method was a successful tool for assessment of regional status and ecological integrity; however, in order to use it for biological criteria development in Washington State, the method would require some modification to complement the current state protocols.

AB  - Breeding of livestock in confined areas has recently become an alternative of production for farmers in Northwest Patagonia. Strong concern about how these practices can alter health and integrity of streams exists and mitigation measures from livestock impact have been recently incorporated to the legislation. We examined changes in water quality, riparian integrity, habitat conditions, and macroinvertebrates community at three low order streams having different modalities of animal production management. The general design included visits at 11 sites (comprising references sites) in a bimonthly scheme. We assessed hydrological and physicochemical features including oxygen, conductivity, nutrients and total suspended solids. Epilithic chlorophyll and bacteria (total coliforms and E. coli) were also measured. Integrity of each site was assessed by two adapted indexes for Patagonian streams: riparian ecosystem quality (QBRp) and habitat condition (HA). A suite of 12 qualitative bioindicator measures based on aquatic macroinvertebrates were utilized at two flow contrasting periods. Compared to reference sites, intensive and semi-intensive practices produced low to moderate impact regarding to oxygen saturation, conductivity and nutrient levels, but strong alteration of the riparian ecosystem and of the in-stream habitat condition were detected. E. coli counting resulted in declining of water quality at both intensive and semi-intensive management, and exceeded the recommended critical value for recreational purposes. Plecoptera and Trichoptera richness significantly diminished at most impacted sites during low water period. In addition, several macroinvertebrate metrics displayed negative and significant responses to ammonia level increases, evidencing a possible toxicity effect. Our findings suggest that these emergent practices, which are rapidly expanding in a relatively undeveloped area, might have negative impacts. Mitigation measures for stream protection should be recommended to landowners through conservation programs.

AB  - Biological indicators often are used to assess and manage water quality in anthropogenically altered stream systems. Leaf breakdown has the potential to be a good indicator of stream integrity because it integrates a variety of biological, chemical, and physical conditions. Red maple (Acer rubrum L.) leaf breakdown rates were measured along a gradient of agricultural land use in southern Appalachian streams to assess the use of leaf breakdown rates as a measure of stream integrity. Landuse categories included forested, light agriculture, moderate agriculture, and heavy agriculture. Leaf breakdown rates were related to landuse category but did not differ significantly among landuse categories. Nutrient concentration, temperature, and sedimentation increased, and dissolved 02 decreased along the landuse gradient from forest to heavy agriculture. Macroinvertebrate richness, macroinvertebrate density and shredder density were the only significant predictors of leaf breakdown rates. We conclude that leaf breakdown rates may not be a useful indicator of stream integrity because of the confounding effects that agricultural land use has on breakdown rates.

AB  - The evaluation of the alochthonous and cosmopolitan mosquitofish species Gambusia affinis suitability as a bioindicator species and the induction of its liver cytochrome P450-dependent mixed function oxygenase (MFO), measured as the 7-ethoxyresorfin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, as well as changes in DNA integrity, measured by the Fast Micromethod (R) for the monitoring of organochlorine fresh water pesticide contamination, were the main aims of the study. The test mosquitofish were exposed under laboratory conditions to several doses (0.1, 10 and 100 mu g l(-1)) of lindane in experimental basins for up to 7 days, and a subsequent field study was carried out at five natural ponds in the south-western Istrian peninsula, Croatia, where up to 10 fish were collected from each pond. Results obtained during the studies showed positive correlations between the measured biomarkers in G. affinis liver (EROD activity and DNA integrity status) and lindane (laboratory experiment) or persistent organochlorine pollutant amounts in natural pond sediments (field study). The clear dose-responses of EROD activity and DNA integrity deterioration in G affinis were recorded after exposure to 0.1-10 mu g/l lindane and 96 h exposure to lindane, respectively. The results indicate that the mosquitofish G. affinis, due to its biological-ecological characteristics and the biomarker dose-response, is suitable for the monitoring of fresh water organochlorine pesticide contamination in general and lindane in particular.

AB  - Driven by the need to replace interim direction, address recent species listings as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, and break the gridlock of implementing actions, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (FS) and the U.S. Department of the Interior. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), initiated an effort to develop a scientifically-sound, ecosystem-based strategy for lands they administer in the Interior Columbia Basin. The effort included an integrated assessment of 58.3 million ha in seven states describing the Basin's current conditions and risks associated with different management strategies. The assessment provides the foundation for environmental impact statements outlining management direction for 31 million hectares of FS and BLM administered lands. The process produced a framework for ecosystem management, ecosystem component (social, economic, landscape, terrestrial, and aquatic) assessments, and estimates of ecological integrity and socioeconomic resiliency.

AB  - There have been increasing calls for the holistic assessment of river condition, moving beyond the traditional focus on water quality and biology alone. Legislation in New Zealand now requires integrated assessments of freshwater ecosystem health. In this paper we report on the application of a framework for New Zealand freshwater assessment, which includes 5 core components-water quality, water quantity, aquatic biota, physical habitat, and ecological processes-in the Tukituki River catchment. Indicators of ecological processes included ecosystem metabolism and cellulose decomposition potential, which were measured and reported alongside other river-health metrics to provide an integrated picture of river ecological integrity at site, stream-type, and catchment scales. Every site in the Tukituki catchment failed to meet bottom-line benchmarks for at least 1 assessment metric. When aggregated by stream type, warm-wet lowland streams in the Tukituki River catchment had the poorest ecosystem health because of poor water quality and quantity. At the catchment scale, the Tukituki scored highly in overall ecosystem health despite 20% of the targeted network failing bottom-line benchmarks for 11 out of 22 metrics. This study demonstrates the value of: 1) a probabilistic sampling design for predicting the spatial extent of stream condition, 2) accounting for environmental variation through a process of data harmonization informed by site-specific reference conditions and bottom-line benchmarks, and 3) involving resource-management practitioners in the development of the assessment framework to ensure that the level of detail is achievable in practice and to provide examples of how the results can inform management actions. Applications could include directing land-use mitigations and stream restoration towards warm-wet lowland areas, where excess phosphorus and aquatic plants proliferate. Finally, we demonstrate how a report-card approach can simultaneously provide information across multiple components and avoid the loss of information. The framework is adaptable and can be used across contrasting spatial scales, it is consistent and representative, and it is easily understood.

AB  - South Atlantic coastal plain streams are unique and understudied freshwater environments that provide crucial habitats for a wide range of aquatic taxa. We investigated patterns in fish assemblages across South Carolina's coastal plain, and developed statistical models to identify the dominant multiscale abiotic environmental factors that influence assemblage structure. Cluster and indicator species analyses of fish assemblage data collected at 208 wadeable streams indicated the presence of four predominant species associations that commonly occur in the South Atlantic coastal plain, which we termed the (1) fluvial, (2) Eastern Mudminnow, (3) centrarchid, and (4) nonfluvial assemblages. A random forest analysis indicated that geographic gradients and instream habitat variables associated with velocity, channel form, stream size, depth, and large wood generally played a greater role in distinguishing fish assemblages than catchment land cover. A follow-up principal component analysis showed that these instream habitat variables showed weak relationships with current anthropogenic land-cover conditions. We suggest several possible explanations for our findings, including (1) a sustained dynamic equilibrium among catchment, riparian, and instream conditions over time may encourage assemblage partitioning among differential instream habitats, (2) past landscape conditions may have a greater influence on current instream habitat conditions and fish assemblage structure than current landscape conditions, (3) weak relationships between catchment land cover and instream habitats may be common in low-elevation regions, and (4) seasonal variation in hydrologic patterns may dominantly influence instream habitat conditions and fish assemblage structure. Our study adds essential information towards a better understanding of how South Atlantic coastal plain fish assemblages respond to environmental factors across multiple spatial scales. Such knowledge will help improve management and conservation strategies, as well as assist in the development of appropriate indicators for standardized evaluations of ecological integrity.

AB  - Shrublands in Mediterranean-type ecosystems worldwide support important ecosystem services including high levels of biodiversity and are threatened by multiple factors in heavily used landscapes. Use, conservation, and management of these landscapes involve diverse stakeholders, making decision processes complex. To be effective, management and land use decisions should be informed by current information on ecosystem quality and resilience. However, obtaining this information is often a challenge due to the extent of landscapes involved. Here we present a conceptual integrity monitoring framework based on simple easily observable ecosystem components readily understood by nonspecialists. Community integrity is defined by plant functional group based on relative proportion of shrubs and nonnative annual grasses. The ability to use these straightforward metrics results from four factors: relatively good alignment of characteristic bird, mammal, and insect communities with shrub cover, positive feedback between annual grasses and short fire intervals, the inhibitory effect of annual grasses on shrub seedling establishment, and similar functional group response to different disturbances. Two additional metrics, indicator species and shrub species diversity, capture subtle yet persistent signatures of disturbance on integrity not reflected in functional group composition. The framework is designed to: categorize habitats into ecosystem integrity classes, forecast likely integrity class changes caused by threats and environmental conditions, and provide a simple reporting mechanism that can be overlain with data on conservation status and vulnerabilities. The proposed framework includes a pilot phase to validate empirical relationships, thresholds, and sampling efficiency. The accessibility of these metrics to nonspecialists is anticipated to enhance communication among stakeholders and thus facilitate problem solving. Leveraging monitoring and mapping programs driven by other needs (e.g., species conservation and fire management) affords meaningful opportunities to offset program costs.

AB  - Dragonflies are reliable indicators of the ecological quality of land-water ecotones, habitat heterogeneity and the hydrological dynamics of water bodies. In recent years, surveys of dragonfly communities have become a powerful tool for the ecological assessment of floodplain areas. The goal of this paper is to present a new approach towards assessing the ecological integrity of river-floodplain systems by analysing resident breeding dragonfly species. The methodology is based on experiences with existing approaches using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators, in particular, calculations of saprobic indices, longitudinal zonation and functional feeding group patterns. In addition to the total number of species and the number of sensitive species, the 'Odonate Habitat Index' (OHI) is a key element of the assessment method. It indicates characteristic features of a river-floodplain system, such as connectivity aspects, flow dynamics and terrestrialization processes. The OHI is calculated from the species-specific habitat values (expressing habitat preferences), abundances and the species-specific indication weight, which distinguishes eurytopic from stenotopic species. The comparison of the status quo with a reference condition allows an assessment of individual water bodies and/or of a whole area in a five-tiered classification scheme. The approach presented may also be used for the evaluation of restoration measures (e.g. reconnection of side arms) and for the definition of management objectives. Apart from the methodological framework, the results of a first application of this approach are presented in the paper as well. The study areas were selected floodplain systems of the Austrian section of the Danube and man-made inshore structures of the impounded Danube section in Vienna.

AB  - Sperms are vulnerable to oxidative stress due to the high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids within their membranes. This condition could decrease sperms quality during preservation. beta-carotene is among antioxidants able to neutralize reactive oxygen species, natural by-products of oxygen metabolism in sperms. This study was done to investigate the capability and protective effect of this antioxidant on motility, viability, acrosomal integrity, and plasma membrane integrity of frozen-thawed sperms of Aceh swamp buffalo. The study was conducted using completely randomized design with four treatments and five replications. Fresh semen was diluted in egg-yolk tris-based extenders with the addition of antioxidant of 0% (w/v) (control, P0), 0.625% (w/v) (P1), 1.25% (w/v) (P2), and 2.5% (w/v) (P3) prior to freezing. Variables of sperms quality examined were motility, viability, acrosomal integrity, and plasma membrane integrity of semen after dilution, equilibration, and thawing. Semen having the best post-thawing quality after beta-carotene treatment was used for artificial insemination (AI) for accessing its pregnancy rate. The results showed that the addition of 0.625% (w/v) beta-carotene (P1) resulted in the highest motility, viability, acrosomal integrity, and plasma membrane integrity. Pregnancy rate of buffalo inseminated with semen treated with 0.625% beta-carotene (P1) was 50%. In conclusion, administration of 0.625% beta-carotene was able to maintain and could protect motility, viability, acrosomal integrity, and plasma membrane integrity of frozen sperms of Aceh swamp buffalo that are good for artificial insemination.

AB  - A method to evaluate the ecological integrity of estuaries at a biogeographical scale is presented. Based on a conceptualisation which systematically establishes how human uses and stressors affect ecosystem functioning, the method allows for regional evaluations of the effect produced by human impacts on the ecological integrity. Comparisons across nine medium size estuaries (Bay of Biscay) showed major alterations in the connectivity (>65% of estuaries) and tidal dynamics (>55% of estuaries) in NE Atlantic estuaries. Likewise, the results obtained highlighted physical barriers such as dykes and land reclamation as the main hydromorphological stressors threatening the ecological integrity. The methodological approach was validated at a restored estuary. The validation primarily confirmed the ability of the conceptual model to identify the main stressors threatening the ecological integrity in estuaries. Secondly, it allowed the identification of the most suitable restoration solutions. Thirdly, it emphasised the importance of the hydrological dynamics to recover the ecosystem's ecological integrity.

AB  - This paper, taking Chagan lake as the study area, uses and improves MWR V1.0 (Rivers (Lake) Health Assessment Indicators, Standards and Methods V1.0) relating to the theory and method of physical structure integrity assessment. A 500 m x 1000 m grid on the lakeshore zone is a basic evaluation unit, and then a lakeshore physical structural integrity evaluation system using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology is established, which contains a target layer, criterion layer and indicator layer. The criterion layer consists of lakeshore condition, shoreline development rate and lake atrophy rate, and the index layer is composed of slope, vegetation cover rate and water level change rate, and another eight indicators. The results showed that for the 23 monitoring points in Chagan lake and the 15 monitoring points in Xinmiao lake, the evaluation results based on RS were 0.60-0.74 and 0.35-0.52, respectively, and the field evaluation results were 0.64-0.77 and 0.35-0.55, respectively. The evaluation results of the two methods consistently indicated that the physical structure of the lakeshore of Chagan lake was healthy and the Xinmiao's lakeshore was sub-health. On this basis, a piecewise evaluation method of physical structure integrity based on the division of the nature reserve function was proposed in this paper.

AB  - We describe a study designed to evaluate the performance of wetland condition indicators of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the north central United States. Basin and landscape scale indicators were tested in 1992 and 1993 to determine their ability to discriminate between the influences of grassland dominated and cropland dominated landscapes in the PPR. Paired plots were selected from each of the major regions of the PPR. Among the landscape scale indicators tested, those most capable of distinguishing between the two landscapes were: 1) frequency of drained wetland basins, 2) total length of drainage ditch per plot, 3) amount of exposed soil in the upland subject to erosion, 4) indices of change in area of wetland covered by water, and 5) number of breeding duck pairs. Basin scale indicators including soil phosphorus concentrations and invertebrate taxa richness showed some promise; however, plant species richness was the only statistically significant basin scale indicator distinguishing grassland dominated from cropland dominated landscapes. Although our study found a number of promising candidate indicators, one of our conclusions is that basin scale indicators present a number of implementation problems, including: skill level requirements, site access denials, and recession of site access by landowners. Alternatively, we suggest that the use of landscape indicators based on remote sensing can be an effective means of assessing wetland integrity.

AB  - The Little Missouri National Grasslands (LMNG) of western North Dakota support the largest permitted cattle grazing use within all lands administered by the USDA, Forest Service, as well as critical habitat for many wildlife species. This fact, coupled with the need to revise current planning direction for range allotments of the LMNG, necessitated that a broad-level characterization of ecosystem integrity and resource conditions be conducted across all lands within the study area (approximately 800,000 hectares) in a rapid and cost-effective manner. The approach taken in this study was based on ecological classifications, which effectively utilized existing field plot data collected for a variety of previous inventory objectives, and their continuous spatial projection across the LMNG by maps of both existing and potential vegetation. These two map themes represent current and reference conditions (existing vs. potential vegetation); their intersection allowed us to assign various ecological status ratings (i.e., ecosystem integrity and resource condition) based on the degree of departure between current and reference conditions. In this paper, we present a brief review of methodologies used in the development of ecological classifications, and also illustrate their application to assessments of rangeland health through selected maps of ecological status ratings for the LMNG.

AB  - The Ecosystem Management Decision Support (Eh IDS) system is an application framework for knowledge-based decision support of ecological assessments. EMDS integrates geographic information system and knowledge base system technologies to provide an analytical tool for environmental assessment and monitoring. The basic objective of EMDS is to improve the quality and completeness of environmental assessments and the efficiency with which they are performed. The USDA Forest Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have cooperatively developed an EMDS knowledge base for watershed condition assessment. Specifically, this knowledge base evaluates watershed processes, patterns, general effects of human activity, and fisheries habitat suitability. Such assessments are based on spatially explicit input data concerning current conditions and reference conditions which are subsequently interpreted by user-defined "fuzzy" membership functions. In this paper we describe basic components of our knowledge base for assessing watershed condition and illustrate its application within northern Idaho and northwestern Montana.

AB  - In the present work, a truss model inspired by von Mises and Bergan trusses is considered. The resulting structure is a phenomenological model that represents the behavior of many engineering structures and may exhibit in-plane snapthrough or pitchfork unstable bifurcation and/or lateral buckling, leading two a multiwell potential function. The topology of the resulting potential function generates a complex bifurcation scenario under harmonic forcing with multiple attractors. The first aim of this work is to investigate the nonlinear vibrations of the proposed model. The interaction of the bifurcation phenomena leads to motions in two-, four- and six-dimensional phase-space. The use of different integrity measures is essential for assessing the robustness of the driven structure to unpredictable finite disturbances of a both static and dynamic nature in such cases. However of the various numerical tools for global dynamic analysis, few are well suited for higher-dimensional systems. In particular the evaluation of integrity measures of multidimensional system requires significant computational resources, being a rather time-consuming procedure. Thus the second aim of the paper is to propose numerical methodologies for evaluating the dynamic integrity measures of multidimensional systems by a Monte Carlo approach. Dynamic integrity analysis of the resulting multidimensional system is performed using three integrity measures, global and local integrity measures (GIM and LIM, respectively) and the integrity factor. Three algorithms based on the Monte Carlo method are proposed to estimate these measures by means of sampling initial conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed approach has a major advantage in comparison to classical methods, since basins of attraction are not needed. Computationally expensive procedures, such as simple cell mapping, are not required. Therefore, the proposed approach has the potential to estimative the dynamic integrity of high dimensional systems with less computational effort, as shown by the obtained results.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss the river-scaling concept (RSC) as a basis for ecological assessments. Since river morphology is a result of two major boundary conditions - transport of water and sediments - the size of project areas and the analysis procedure were found to be critical. Restricting the assessment of abiotic and biotic river components and its variability to a certain scale neglects the fact that ecological integrity depends on the process scale of boundary conditions. A newly developed two-step procedure for assessing the ecological integrity at various temporal and spatial scales is presented. During the so-called downscaling phase, abiotic and biotic components are analysed at the regional-continental (only for special questions), catchment-wide, sectional, local, and point scales. Catchment-wide analyses are based on digital elevation models (DEMs) and geographic information systems (GISs). Mass balance analysis, the application of fractals, and self-similarity studies for channel developments gain increasing importance. The application of linear and non-linear theories allows analytical tools to be derived to describe abiotic components like morphodynamics at sectional and local scales. Point scale investigations are based on deterministic models, where input data can be measured directly in nature. As the scale varies dramatically, the results obtained from various analysis tools are significantly different but interdependent. Biotic analysis are also performed at the same scales, so that the interrelations between morphodynamics and habitat quality can be derived at the end of this first phase. In a second phase an upscaling integrates and aggregates the results from the first step in order to yield overall conclusions on ecological integrity.

AB  - We examined the use of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) for assessments of ecological condition using an avian community-based indicator, the Bird Community Index (BCI). In previous research, the BCI was developed and applied to a random sample of sites in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands. The goal of providing national scale assessments with bird community indicators hinges on a demonstration that existing monitoring programs, like the BBS, can be tapped as source data for the indicators. Our goal was to compare a BBS-based assessment of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands to our original assessment based on random sampling locations. We subsampled three iterations of BBS route data from the study area to account for spatial and temporal scale differences between 40 km BBS routes and the original 1 kin transects sampled to develop the BCI. All three iterations of BBS subsamples provided lower overall assessments of ecological condition for the Mid-Atlantic Highlands relative to our original research. Land cover analysis, however, revealed that BBS routes sampled land cover types in proportion to their actual prevalence in the region. Thus, we conclude that BBS data are appropriate as source data for broad scale ecological assessments with indicators such as the BCI. For numerous analytical and logistical reasons, we recommend 10-stop subsamples of BBS data as the preferred scale at which to apply bird community indicators of ecological condition.

AB  - Multimetric Indices (MMIs) have been widely applied for ecological assessment in freshwater ecosystems. Most MMIs face difficulties when scaling up from small spatial scales because larger scales usually encompass great environmental variability. Covariance of anthropogenic pressures with natural environmental gradients can be a confounding factor in assessing biologic responses to anthropogenic pressures. This study presents the development and validation of a predictive multimetric index to assess the ecological condition of Atlantic Forest wadeable streams using benthic macroinvertebrates. To do so, we sampled 158 sites for the index development. We adjusted each biological metric to natural variation through multiple regression analyses (stepwise-forward) and considered that the residual distribution describes the metric variation in the absence of natural environmental influence. For metric selection we considered normal distribution, variation explained by the models, redundancy between metrics and sensitivity to differentiate reference from impaired sites. We selected five metrics to the final index: total richness, %MOLD, %Coleoptera, EPT richness and Chironomidae abundance. The residuals were transformed into probabilities and the final index was obtained through the mean of these probabilities. This index performed well in discriminating the impairment gradient and it showed a high correlation (r = 0.85, p <0.001) with a specific index developed fora particular basin indicating a similar sensitivity. This index can be used to assess wadeable streams ecological condition in Atlantic Forest biome, so we believe that this type of approach represents an important step towards the application of biomonitoring tools in Brazil.

AB  - We developed a preliminary fish-based multimetric index (MMI) to assess biotic condition of Atlantic Rain Forest streams in Southeastern Brazil. We used least-disturbed sites as proxies of reference conditions for metric development. To determine the disturbance gradient we used an Integrated Disturbance Index (ID!) that summarized the multiple disturbances measured at local/regional catchment scales in a single index, describing the totality of exposure of the streams to human pressures. For our 48 sites, nine were least-disturbed (IDI < 0.25), five were most-disturbed (IDI > 1.35) and 34 were intermediate. Initially, we considered 41 candidate metrics selected primarily from previous studies. We screened this pool of candidate metrics using a series of tests: range test, signal-to-noise test, correlation with natural gradients, responsiveness test, and redundancy test. After screening, we selected six metrics for the MMI: % Characiform individuals, % water column native individuals, % benthic invertivorous individuals, % tolerant species, % intolerant species, and % detritivorous individuals. Metrics such as diversity, dominance, species richness and biomass that have been historically used for assessing ecosystem condition failed one or more screening tests. We conclude that an IDI and rigorous metric screening are critical to the MMI development process and for meaningful assessments of stream condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A major issue for water resource management is the assessment of environmental degradation of lotic ecosystems. The overall aim of this study is to develop a multi-metric fish index for the cyprinid streams of the Caspian Sea Basin (MMICS) in Iran. As species diversity and composition as well as population structure in the studied streams are different to other regions, there is a substantial need to develop a new fish index. We sampled fish and environmental data of 102 sites in medium sized streams. We analysed human pressures at different spatial scales and determined applicable fish metrics showing a response to human pressures. In total, five structural and functional types of metrics (i.e. biodiversity, habitat, reproduction, trophic level and water quality sensitivity) were considered. In addition, we used 29 criteria describing major anthropogenic human pressures at sampling sites and generated a regional pressure index (RPI) that accounted for potential effects of multiple human pressures.
   For the MMICS development, we first defined reference sites (least disturbed) and secondly quantified differences of fish metrics between reference and impaired sites. We used a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) to describe metric responses to natural environmental differences in least disturbed conditions. By including impaired sites, the residual distributions of these models described the response range of each metric to human pressures, independently of natural environmental influence.
   Finally, seven fish metrics showed the best ability to discriminate between impaired and reference sites. The multi-metric fish index performed well in discriminating human pressure classes, giving a significant negative linear response to a gradient of the RPI. These methods can be used for further development of a standardised monitoring tool to assess the ecological status and trends in biological condition for streams of the whole country, considering its complex and diverse geology and climate.

AB  - The synergistic effects of run-of-the-river (ROR) on fish fauna, though still poorly understood, are amplified when dams form reservoir cascades. In an attempt to assist in this understanding, we used an adaptation of the Reservoir Fish Assemblage Index (RFAI) to evaluate the biotic conditions of the Rio das Antas Energy Complex, in the Neotropical Patos Lagoon ecoregion. We evaluated the attributes of the fish fauna from the point of view of the complex, for each reservoir and between different sections. Fish samplings were performed quarterly at nine sites for 2 years (2015-2017). We proposed 26 metrics, related to aspects of composition, reproduction, feeding, habitat, and tolerance, selected based on criteria of variability, responsiveness, and redundancy. The final RFAI score was distributed in four categories of biological status, based on the best-observed condition. Eight metrics composed the final index, among which, only the proportion of nektonic individuals + nektobenthic (PNNbI) correlated with all sections. The final RFAI was classified as poor in all sections of the reservoir cascade, showing no significant differences between the sampling sites. This scenario indicates that dams in sequence intensify and homogenize the amplitude of fragmentation impacts on fish fauna. The final RFAI proved to be representative of the transition sections, emphasizing the importance of these reaches in impounded environments. Although the disturbance scales presented here are applicable mainly to ROR systems with reduced discharge section, the index was developed so as to allow its replicability in any dammed water course.

AB  - This work evaluates the consequences of anthropogenic pressures at different sections of a Patagonian mountain river using a set of environmental and biological measures. A map of risk of soil erosion at a basin scale was also produced. The study was conducted at 12 sites along the Percy River system, where physicochemical parameters, riparian ecosystem quality, habitat condition, plants, and macroinvertebrates were investigated. While livestock and wood collection, the dominant activities at upper and mean basin sites resulted in an important loss of the forest cover still the riparian ecosystem remains in a relatively good status of conservation, as do the in-stream habitat conditions and physicochemical features. Besides, most indicators based on macroinvertebrates revealed that both upper and middle basin sections supported similar assemblages, richness, density, and most functional feeding group attributes. Instead, the lower urbanized basin showed increases in conductivity and nutrient values, poor quality in the riparian ecosystem, and habitat condition. According to the multivariate analysis, ammonia level, elevation, current velocity, and habitat conditions had explanatory power on benthos assemblages. Discharge, naturalness of the river channel, flood plain morphology, conservation status, and percent of urban areas were important moderators of plant composition. Finally, although the present land use in the basin would not produce a significant risk of soil erosion, unsustainable practices that promotes the substitution of the forest for shrubs would lead to severe consequences. Mitigation efforts should be directed to protect headwater forest, restore altered riparian ecosystem, and to control the incipient eutrophication process.

AB  - At informal heritage sites, a complex mutually-detrimental interaction or 'cycle of risk' between human, animal and ecological risk factors was detected where water quality is representative of ecological risk and cultural practices associated with the heritage intrinsic to sites are indicative of human risk. Informal heritage sites are therefore especially vulnerable as they are actively utilised, but not formally protected or sustainably managed. In South Africa, biomonitoring methods are used nationally for a rapid assessment of aquatic ecosystem health, subsuming a number of index models. There are six index models wherein water quality is ensconced. Of these the Physico-chemical Driver Assessment Index (PAI) is more complex and comprehensive than the others and therefore not conventionally the most rapid application. In addition, the Health Impact Assessment (HIA) was developed recently to measure the community health of people. Despite its complexity, water quality as part of the PAI was found to be the most appropriate of the available biomonitoring indices and, in this context, the most productive indicator for the cultural heritage-ecology interaction at informal heritage sites. This is based on the fact that potable water is such a fundamental human need and intricately interwoven with ritual cultural practice. The objective of the study was therefore to propose a biomonitoring model to explore the integrity of informal heritage sites where integrity encapsulates the environmental health and the authenticity of cultural practice as heritage. The authors conceived a 'bio-cultural screening' model and explored water quality as primary indicator, where water quality comprises biological (algal, bacterial), chemical (oxygen, pH, TDS, phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, chlorophyll-a) and physical (temperature, turbidity) analyses. This method is then put forward as the Rapid Integrity Appraisal (RIA) for informal heritage sites, which may lead to the further application of other biomonitoring indices to these sites should a more nuanced exploration of the integrity of specific sites be required.

AB  - Water resources demand constant conservation actions due to several problems (e.g. riparian vegetation cut-off, construction of dams. acidification, sewage and pesticide spills) that degrade the aquatic systems worldwide and affect its physicochemical parameters and habitat characteristics. Odonata is a potential group of organisms that could indicate these habitat alterations once they have aquatic and terrestrial life forms. In this study, we tested the use of adult odonate individual species and community assemblage measures to evaluate the effect of riparian vegetation cut-off and sewage discharges. The study was performed at Turvo Sujo River, in Vicosa, Southern Brazil. We selected twelve sites, six of them were upstream and six were downstream the city. Species abundance and species richness estimates of adult odonates were performed on sunny days during summer and winter. We analyzed the goodness-of-fit of the species abundances to geometric and lognormal series. We also measured the Habitat Physical Integrity Score (HPIS), pasture and forest proportions and physicochemical water parameters at each site. Only few species were abundant in up- and downstream regions. Abundance of Argia modesta was higher at the upstream (t = 3.188; df = 17: p = 0.005) than at the downstream region and this species is a potential habitat bioindicator organisms. Species richness was statistically different only in the wet season and species-abundance relations at the two regions fitted well to both geometric and lognormal series. The lack of riparian vegetation indicates a loss of habitat integrity and heterogeneity at Turvo Sujo River basin, which was mainly dominated by lake-dwelling odonate species. Low species richness differences are caused by species pool biases toward those ones capable to survive at degraded ecosystems, suggesting that the effects of water parameters are much less important than a landscape dominated by pastures and practically without forests. We suggest the use of species-abundance models (like geometric and lognormal series) to determine the degree of impacts over a given community once they are simple models and can show intrinsic processes structuring communities.

AB  - The present work presents an ecological assessment method that is applied to the vegetation units (habitat types) of the Lagadas county (Thessaloniki prefecture, Greece). The ecological conditions of the habitats are examined (climatic conditions, altitude, slopes, orientations and soil characteristics) along with their ecological integrity status (representativity, conservation status, level of biodiversity, soil and water conservation, ecological assessment status), current threats (fire risk, anthropogenic activities) and the economic suitability - appropriateness for range, forestry, recreation - agro-tourism and general economical assessment status. The research adopts a methodological approach based upon the principles of basic ecology and tools from landscape ecology. The natural vegetation of the region is mainly covered by Mediterranean shrublands (dominated by kermes oak - Quercus coccifera), deciduous broadleaved oak forests and grasslands which are present in almost all bioclimatic zones. A number of additional habitats is present in the area which show great dependence on climate and altitude. Where the human presence is lower (mainly in higher altitudes), then the ecological integrity the habitat is better preserved, the ecosystems are well structured, with a good to excellent representativity, conservation status, level of biodiversity, soil and water conservation and global ecological assessment.

AB  - Water Framework Directive (WFD) fostered research interest on bioassessment tools to evaluate the ecological integrity of surface waters. The application of WFD implies the reliability enhancement of existing bioassessment tools to larger geographic areas for a better convergence across European Union (UE) state members as well as the maintenance or enhancement of ecological functions of water bodies. Among the several available biological indicators, those elaborated using stream invertebrate communities are common for monitoring river ecological integrity in EU member states. The performance of four different approaches (biotic indices, multimetrics, multivariate, and based on biological traits of taxa) are represented. Apparent contradictions between scientific development and associated creativity and complexity, on one hand, and the necessity for summarising ecological integrity by a single score as required by most decision-makers, on another hand, have implied that none of the currently, developed methology is ideal. However, trends is some approaches help the identification of elements needed to the elaboration of a reliable biomonitoring tool. Such tool should (i) be operational on both local and regional scales, (ii) rely on prediction and reference conditions, and (iii) address both the occurrence of taxa and measures of ecological functions (e.g., biological traits).

AB  - Wildlife managers face the daunting task of managing wildlife in light of uncertainty about the nature and extent of future climate change and variability and its potential adverse impacts on wildlife. A conceptual framework is developed for managing wildlife under such uncertainty. The framework uses fuzzy logic to test hypotheses about the extent of the wildlife impacts of past climate change and variability, and fuzzy multiple attribute evaluation to determine best compensatory management actions for adaptively managing the potential adverse impacts of future climate change and variability on wildlife. A compensatory management action is one that can offset some of the potential adverse impacts of climate change and variability on wildlife. Implementation of the proposed framework requires wildlife managers to: (1) select climate impact states, hypotheses about climate impact states. possible management actions for alleviating adverse wildlife impacts of climate change and variability, and future climate change scenarios; (2) choose biological attributes or indicators of species integrity; (3) adjust those attributes for changes in non-climatic variables; (4) define linguistic variables and associated triangular fuzzy numbers for rating both the acceptability of biological conditions under alternative management actions and the relative importance of biological attributes; (5) select minimum or maximum acceptable levels of the attributes and reliability levels for chance constraints on the biological attributes; and (6) define fuzzy sets on the extent of species integrity and biological conditions and select a fuzzy relation between species integrity and biological conditions. A constructed example is used to illustrate a hypothetical application of the framework by a wildlife management team. An overall best compensatory management action across all climate change scenarios is determined using the minimax regret criterion, which is appropriate when the management team cannot assign or is unwilling to assign probabilities to the future climate change scenarios. Application of the framework can be simplified and expedited by incorporating it in a web-based, interactive, decision support tool. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid assessment of aquatic ecosystems has been widely implemented, sometimes without thorough evaluation of the robustness of rapid assessment metrics as indicators of ecological integrity. Here, we evaluate whether the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method (ORAM) for Wetlands Version 5.0 is a useful indicator of ecological integrity beyond its intended purpose. ORAM was developed to categorize natural wetlands for regulatory purposes and to contribute to the development of indicators of biotic integrity. It was never intended for use as an index of the quality of habitat for wetland birds. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that ORAM scores could serve as adequate predictors of avian diversity. We evaluated whether avian species richness in wetlands could be reliably predicted from each of the following variables: (1) total ORAM score, (2) total score minus the score for one metric that did not apply to all wetlands, and (3) sum of scores for the four ORAM components (of 16 scored) with the highest potential point total. These four components corresponded to aquatic vegetation communities, microtopography, modifications to natural hydrologic regime, and sources of water. All three variables were significant predictors of both total species richness and mean species richness of birds of conservation concern. Variable (3) was a significant predictor of mean species richness of wetland-dependent birds. Variable (2) was a weak predictor of both total and mean species richness of all birds combined. These results extend the robustness of ORAM as an indicator of the ecological integrity of wetlands.

AB  - 1. A large number of ecological indicators have been applied to environmental quality assessment. including taxonomic indices based oil one or more biotic elements and eventually environmental variables. Several structural parameters of benthic invertebrate assemblages (i.e. diversity. abundance and proportion of disturbance-sensitive taxa) have been included European Water Framework Directive (WFD) to rank the ecological status of the transitional waters.
   2 Several macrobenthic biotic indices based oil species diversity and sensitivities to anthropogenic disturbance. were proposed as effective tools to answer the requirements WFD, however, little is known about the responses of these indices Under differing ecological conditions.
   3. In the present study patterns of variation of five benthic biotic indices (AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX, Engle's B-IBI, and Pauls B-IBI) have been compared in eight Mediterranean and Black Sea transitional water ecosystem characterized by different habitat typologies and anthropogenic pressures.
   4. Overall. biotic indices provided contrasting responses in terms of environmental quality assessments.

AB  - The habitat templet approach was used in a scale-sensitive bioindicator assessment for the ecological integrity of riverbanks and for specific responses to river management. Ground beetle habitat templets were derived from a catchment-scale sampling, integrating the overall variety of bank types. This coarse-filter analysis was integrated in the reach-scale fine-filtering approaches of community responses to habitat integrity and river management impacts. Higher species diversity was associated with the higher heterogeneity in bank habitats of the un-navigable river reaches. The abundant presence of habitat specialists in the riverbank zone allows a habitat integrity assessment based on the habitat templet indicator species. Significant responses were detected for channel morphology in the width-to-depth ratio and for hydrological regime in peak frequency and peak velocity, enabling the development of evaluation methods for the impact assessment of river management and flood protection strategies.

AB  - Efforts to quantify disturbances to aquatic systems often use landscape-level metrics, presumably linked to ecological integrity, but fewer studies have directly linked ecological integrity to instream habitat, and applied these results to unsampled stream reaches throughout a landscape. We developed a flexible, quantitative approach that characterizes stream impairment across a landscape and identifies least-disturbed stream reaches to serve as benchmarks for high quality physical habitat and ecological integrity. Fish and macroinvertebrate community characteristics, reach-level physical habitat and water quality metrics were summarized in 891 wadeable stream reaches across two ecoregions in Missouri, USA. The influence of reach and water-quality characteristics as well as landscape-level variables on 7 fish and 3 macroinvertebrate community biological indicator metrics was then modeled using boosted regression trees (BRTs). On average, reach-level models explained more variance (25 and 27% in the two ecoregions examined) in biotic metrics than landscape-level models (18% and 20%). Abiotic and biotic associations differed among ecoregions and stream sizes, however, reach-level habitat (e.g., bankfull width/depth ratio, channel incision height) and water quality (e.g., dissolved oxygen, total chlorophyll) were consistently top predictors. At the landscape scale, fish richness in the agriculturally dominated ecoregion increased with decreased fragmentation/flow modification. Invertebrate metrics in the forested ecoregion showed community degradation apparent with crop coverage as low as 8-10% of the riparian zone, while urban impairment, most notably in the agricultural ecoregion, was best detected using invertebrate indicators of biotic integrity and measures of fish trophic ecology. Relationships among landscape-scale variables and reach characteristics identified as top predictors in BRTs also highlighted potential mechanistic relationships among landscape, habitat, and measures of ecological integrity. Using the results of the landscape-level models, estimates for overall ecological integrity were predicted for over 28,000 stream reaches throughout Missouri, and a total of 1423 candidate reference reaches were identified. The objective approach to characterizing stream impairment developed in this study offers specific advantages, including a reach and landscape-level evaluation of human disturbance as well as an inductive, multi-metric determination of ecological integrity.

AB  - Climate change is gradual and long-term, consistently collected data are required to detect resulting biological responses and to separate such responses from local effects of human activities that monitoring programs usually are designed to assess. The reference-condition approach is commonly used in freshwater assessments that use predictive modeling, but a consistent reference condition is required to maintain the relevance and integrity of results over the long term. We investigated whether external influences, such as climate change, inhibited clear interpretation of bioassessment results in a study design using reference vs test sites. Macroinvertebrates were collected from 16 sites (11 sites affected by ski resorts and 5 reference sites) on 5 streams in 4 seasons each year from 1994 to 2008 within Kosciuszko National Park, Australia. We analyzed trends over 15 y to address questions regarding climate-change and macroinvertebrate bioindicators of stream condition (observed/expected [O/E] taxa; Stream Invertebrate Grade Number Average Level [SIGNAL] 2 scores; Simpson's Diversity; Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera [EPT] richness ratio; and Oligochaeta abundance). Climate became slightly warmer and less humid (p < 0.0001), but no significant relationships between climate variables and bioindicators were evident. All bioindicators consistently distinguished between test and reference sites in all seasons. All bioindicators except for O/E taxa scores differed among streams (regardless of site type). O/E taxa are inherently adjusted for specific stream characteristics, and, thus, were robust to differences in stream type while remaining sensitive to reference and test site variation. Generally, reference and test sites did not respond differently to any gradual climate changes. Furthermore, the reference sites sampled through time remained in a condition equivalent to the previously defined reference condition and provided a valid comparison for current test sites of unknown condition. The bioindicators used here were insensitive to the small but significant changes in climate detected over the 15-y study. However, extreme climate-related events (such as severe drought and extensive bushfire) were detected by the chosen bioindicators at both reference and test sites. Ecological outcomes of climate change can be accounted for only by an appropriate study design that includes standardized sampling of fixed sites (both test and reference) over long periods.

AB  - Aspen (Populus tremuloides) communities were measured in and near Yoho and Kootenay National Parks to determine condition and trend. Most aspen stands were heavily invaded by conifers as they had not burned in 60 years or more due to modem fire suppression and the elimination of aboriginal burning. Aspen is also declining due to repeated ungulate browsing, primarily by Elk (Cervus elaphus). Even where disturbed by logging and burning outside the parks, many aspen stands failed to produce new stems greater than 2 m tall because all the suckers were repeatedly browsed. Only where ungulate numbers were low was aspen able to successfully regenerate. Aspen, though, is not "seral," as that term is commonly used because the species seldom grows from seed due to its demanding seed bed requirements. This, coupled with high biodiversity, makes aspen an excellent indicator of ecological integrity as mandated by Parks Canada statute.

AB  - Relationships between land use/cover (LUC) and stream water quality have been well-documented in many environments and at a range of spatial scales. From these analyses, reduced in-stream biological integrity and habitat quality are commonly associated with increasing amounts of anthropogenic LUC. However, very few studies have examined the influence of landscape condition, relative to studies using LUC, on water quality parameters. Landscape condition indices use remote sensing-based data to quantify biophysical land surface condition. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationships between LUC class proportions and indices of land surface condition (LSC) and macroinvertebrate-based water quality metrics. These relationships were examined at three spatial scales (reach, stream network, and catchment). Strong correlations were observed between both LUC class proportions and LSC indices with macroinvertebrate-based metrics, although there was almost twice the number of significant correlations for LUC as compared with LSC. Similar to previous research, relationships between landscape variables and macroinvertebrate metrics were not consistent across spatial scales. Overall, results suggest that LUC class proportions are better indicators of water quality conditions in the study area. Future work will expand this analysis and include additional water quality parameters and landscape variables with the goals of deepening the understanding of landscape impacts on stream water quality and providing resource managers with valuable information that will to help guide planning and assessment activities.

AB  - Biological indicators or indices of biotic integrity (IBI) have been developed for land management and regulatory agencies to categorize the condition of a given ecosystem. IBIs are more widely used in lotic systems and those that can be used over wide geographic regions or multiple systems are deemed most valuable. Lacustrine wetlands have intrinsic complexity and multidimensionality making them very difficult to classify. This, in turn, greatly affects the transferability of indices created for explicit regions and wetland types. Similarly, due to scarcity, relatively pristine reference conditions are seldom included in IBI calibration and represent a critical end of the disturbance continuum. The robustness and transferability of macroinvertebrate and fish IBIs created for fringing lacustrine and drowned river mouth wetlands of the Great Lakes for use in wetlands occurring in inland-lakes on islands within the Great Lakes were tested. Islands within the Laurentian Great Lakes contain unique and critical habitats that have received little attention, but also require specialized tools for monitoring and management. Inland-lake wetlands of Beaver Island, Lake Michigan, were ranked a priori along a disturbance gradient based on adjacent land use/cover. Transferability of the pre-existing Great Lakes IBIs was determined by correlating the site-specific IBI rank with the site-specific disturbance ranks. Results indicated that the IBIs were not directly transferable and may require substantial modification.

AB  - The use of macroinvertebrates in the assessment of wetland ecosystem integrity is an increasingly common tool used for management and conservation. The sensitivity of macroinvertebrates to ecological fluctuation makes them reliable and appealing indicators of ecosystem integrity. However, there is little or no published data available for assessment of wetland ecosystem integrity on the basis of macroinvertebrate species diversity in constructed wetlands of metropolitan Melbourne. The aim of the following study was to assess significant differences in macroinvertebrate diversity in three constructed wetlands in South East metropolitan Melbourne and consequently, suitability as a universal measure of wetland ecosystem integrity. Three wetlands were chosen randomly, with the requirement that they were entirely man-made, from a list of constructed wetlands in South East metropolitan Melbourne. Between 481 and 629 organisms were found in each wetland comprising 16 different taxa. The one-way ANOVA for species richness (P 0.05, F = 0.19) and Shannon-Weiner diversity index (P 0.05, F = 2.54) indicate no significant differences between the wetlands in both of these measures. The data collected in the present study compared with published species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity index data suggests macroinvertebrate species diversity can be used as a universal measure of wetland ecosystem integrity in constructed wetlands in South East metropolitan Melbourne. This is important where there is need for a rapid and streamlined tool for assessment of ecosystem integrity and consequently, the management and conservation of constructed wetlands.

AB  - Forest condition, biodiversity, and ecosystem services are strongly interlinked. The biodiversity levels depend to a large extent on the integrity, health, and vitality of forests at the same time as losses of forest biodiversity lead to decreased forest productivity and sustainability. Under this conceptual framework, this study presents a methodology for mapping forest condition at European scale supporting the attainment of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Target 5 "the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced" and the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as well as the EU forest strategy since the sustainable forest management is oriented to support the provision of forest services and to enhance the condition of biodiversity forests' host.
   The work presents the developments of an operational indicator at European scale. This spatially explicit information on forest condition can be the baseline map with a 1 km resolution to monitor the state and changes of condition by exposition to pressures and threats. This condition indicator considers structural, functional, and compositional aspects of forest with relevance for health and vitality of species and habitats hosted by forest ecosystems.
   The methodology implemented used harmonized, published and open datasets. It provided confident results for the assessment of the condition within hemiboreal, temperate and alpine forests, showing the Carpathian, Dinaric Alps and Alps, among others, as hotspots with pre-dominantly good condition. The results were validated with data derived from the reporting for the EU Habitat Directive and explicit dataset on known primary forests in Europe. However, this method underestimated the forest condition in the Mediterranean and Boreal forest types due to data gaps, regional specific characteristics, and design limitations.
   This study illustrates an operational and transferable approach for addressing the assessment of ecosystem forest condition at European scale being considered as a support tool for European countries when mapping and assessing their national territory, as potential common approach to map forest ecosystems that allows for consistent aggregation and comparisons across scales.

AB  - The integrity of block copolymer micelles is important for their effectiveness and successful delivery of the incorporated drugs. Here we evaluate the integrity of poly(caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) micelles in media of varying chemical complexity and in cells by using fluorogenic micelles. Fluorogenic dye fluorescein-5-carbonyl azide diacetate was covalently attached to the micelle-core-forming part of the block copolymer, poly(caprolactone). The fluorescence was not detectable unless the poly(caprolactone)(21)-b-poly(ethylene oxide)(45) micelles were destroyed and the fluorogenic dye was activated by deesterification. The fluorescence of the activated dye from destroyed micelles was easily detectable in various media and in cells. Micelles were stable in simple media such as phosphate-buffered saline but disassembled to varying extents with increasing chemical complexity of the media and addition of serum. The integrity of the internalized micelles within the cells showed a time-dependent decrease but remained largely preserved (80%) after 20 h of incubation with cells. A proof of principle was also demonstrated in vivo in mice. The fluorogenic approach to micelle integrity assessment presented herein should lend itself to other block copolymer micelles and assessments of their integrity in complex biological systems in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) occur across most of the world's drylands and are sensitive indicators of dryland degradation. Accounting for shifts in biocrust composition is important for quantifying integrity of arid and semi-arid ecosystems, but the best methods for assessing biocrusts are uncertain. We investigate the utility of surveying biocrust morphogroups, a reduced set of biotic classes, compared to species data, for detecting shifts in biocrust composition and making inference about dryland degradation. We used multivariate regression tree (MRT) analyses to model morphogroup abundance, species abundance and species occurrence data from two independent studies in semi-arid open woodlands of south-eastern Australia. We advanced the MRT method with a best subsets' model selection procedure, which improved model stability and prediction. Biocrust morphogroup composition responded strongly to surrogate variables of ecological degradation. Further, MRT models of morphogroup data had stronger explanatory power and predictive power than MRT models of species abundance or occurrence data. We also identified morphogroup indicators of degraded and less degraded sites in our study region.Synthesis and applications. Sustainable management of drylands requires methods to assess shifts in ecological integrity. We suggest that biocrust morphogroups are highly suitable for assessment of dryland integrity because they allow for non-expert, rapid survey and are informative about ecological function. Furthermore, morphogroups were more robust than biocrust species data, showed a strong response to ecological degradation and were less influenced by environmental variation, and models of morphogroup abundance were more predictive.

AB  - The reference condition approach, advocated by the Water Framework Directive, is the basis of most currently used multimetric indices using functional traits of fish species. The ecological status of streams is assessed by measuring the deviation of the observed trait values from the theoretical values of reference conditions in the absence of anthropogenic disturbances. While reference conditions serve as baselines for ecological assessment, they vary with natural environmental conditions. Therefore, global warming appears to be a major threat to the use of current indices for diagnosing future stream conditions, as climate change is projected to modify assemblage composition, suggesting that the functional structure of fish assemblages will also be affected. The main objectives of this study are to assess the potential effect of climate change on the trait composition of fish assemblages and the consequences for the establishment of reference conditions. The results highlight the relation between environmental, especially climatic, conditions and functional traits and project the effects of climate change on trait composition. Traits based on species intolerance are expected to be most negatively affected by the projected climatic shift. The consequences for the development of multimetric indices based on fish functional traits are discussed.

AB  - Trade has become a carrier for transporting both clean and dirty (pollution-intensive) goods, services and technologies between countries. While the impact of trade on economic development has been reported in the extant literature, insufficient and inconsistent results exist between pollution-embedded trade and environmental performance. Using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Generalized method of moments and panel quantiles via Moments, this study explored the role of government integrity on trade-environment nexus in the post-Kyoto protocol era for 79 countries between 2008 and 2018. The empirical results suggest that per capita GDP and government integrity improve environmental performance whereas trade impedes it. In the quantile regression model, the effect of government integrity is significant at the median quantiles with a stronger effect in countries with higher environmental performance. The negative effect of trade is not only significant from the lower quantile through the median quantile but decreases in magnitude, tracking from countries with lower to higher environmental performance. While the positive effect of government integrity is significant from the median quantile onwards, the negative effect of trade is only significant in the lower quantile. Robustness analysis from the GMM dynamic panel estimation technique shows that interacting government integrity with trade yields a positive and significant coefficient. Meaning that improved government integrity averts the negative effect of trade on environmental performance. The study suggests that outsourcing the regulations of trade-oriented multinational companies operating in developing economies with weak institutions to global humanitarian organisations such as the United Nations would be the first step to reduce trade-attributable environmental degradation.

AB  - Urban growth has a significant impact on natural environments, particularly in valley bottom areas. This paper aimed to elaborate a tool for the preliminary assessment of the environmental integrity of valley bottoms in order to provide preliminary support to managers of public administration in the diagnosis and decision-making to intervene in these areas. Therefore, we chose environmental indicators and the tool was applied to assess the environmental situation of two valley bottoms located in the city of Maringa Parana State, Mandacaru and Betty streams. The indicators were selected using literature as references and underwent the assessment of 30 professionals who work in drainage projects or environmental management, so that they attributed weights according to the relevance of the indicator to assess the environmental condition of valley bottoms located in medium-sized cities, with consolidated urbanization and infrastructure. At the end of the application of indicators, the rate of compliance with the proposed indicators (I) was calculated. To characterize the two valley bottoms, which are the fields of study, thematic maps were prepared and we consulted published studies on the region and conducted fieldworks. The Mandacaru stream presented services to the proposed indicators (I) equal to 35.88% and the Betty stream was equal to 4320%. Both streams have their environmental condition classified as poor, according to the applied methodology.

AB  - In virtually every major environmental act, Congress has required that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) ensure not only that the air be safe to breathe, the water safe to drink, and the food supply free of contamination, but also that the environment be protected. In response, the U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) has established research to improve ecosystem risk assessment and management, identifying it as one of the highest priority research areas for investment over the next 10 years. The research is intended to provide environmental managers with new tools and flexible guidance that reflect a holistic environmental management perspective of science and that can be applied both to common and unique problems. In keeping with its responsibility to provide the U.S. EPA with science that supports a dynamic changing regulatory agenda, the ORD has set the goal of its Ecological Research Program to "provide the scientific understanding required to measure, model, maintain and/or restore, at multiple scales, the integrity and sustainability of ecosystems now, and in the future." In the context of this program, ecological integrity is defined in relative terms as the maintenance of ecosystem structure and function characteristic of a reference condition deemed appropriate for its use by society, and sustainability is defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain relative ecological integrity into the future. Therefore, the research program will emphasize relative risk and consider the impact of multiple stressors, at multiple scales and at multiple levels of biological organization. The program will also shift from chemical to biological and physical stressors to a far greater extent than in the past. The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to the U.S. EPA's changing ecological research program.

AB  - The assessment of conservation values and risks to habitat biological diversity and health is herein addressed based on the occurrence of threatened species within ecotype mosaics and incorporating metrics related to current human disturbances. This assessment is made within a view of biological integrity and ecosystem health. Within the Map of Italian Nature project, that started as a result of Italian national law n. 394/91, such assessments are currently applied to approximately 1.5 million hectares in order to establish new reserves and protected areas, based on their "natural values" and "fragility" at scales in which humans generally influence the condition of the landscape, to get a more representative network of regional biological diversity. Risk and value assessments, based on distribution of species and habitats most threatened with extinction and reduction, are made in reference to the coordination of information on the environment (CORINE) habitat mosaics. To this purpose, digital thematic maps are generated as geographic information systems (GIS) coverages in polygonal (vector) format from satellite, airborne, and observed distribution data of 1)existing land cover habitat types and biodiversity component distributions, and 2) different kinds of man-induced disturbance. Habitat fragility is estimated either as "potential," through a simple conceptual model relating fragility to sensitivity and human disturbance, or as "displayed," inferred from habitat loss. Habitat sensitivity is used to compare biological health within habitat types. The Map of Italian Nature project aims at identifying gaps in the existing reserve network, and is very akin to the gap analysis approach. Map of Italian Nature intends to protect landscape mosaics at the broader scale, based on gaps in protection and threats while including finer scale data on threatened species to make sure they do not fall through the cracks. Results for a pilot study area are presented and the relevance of the approach to biological health and integrity assessments is discussed.

AB  - Forest integrity has been proposed as one conservation endpoint that integrates desirable characteristics such as natural biodiversity, stand structure and continuity. Although its defining criteria are still under discussion, any surrogates must effectively represent or predict their status, and be easier to measure than the criteria themselves. Bryophytes have been proposed as such surrogates, because they are important components of forest integrity, and considerable research indicates that some groups are sensitive to the changes associated with specific forest management regimes. The objectives of this paper are (1) to review the issues in determining indicators of forest integrity, including desirable qualities in such indicators, (2) to review the state of knowledge concerning bryophytes as components of forest integrity (i.e. their responses to forest management practices), and (3) to assess bryophytes as potential indicators of forest integrity, in terms of both qualities desirable in indicators and our understanding of bryophyte response patterns. Although bryophytes possess some characteristics that suggest potential indicator value, many challenges prevent their reliable application. I highlight key areas in which research is required to identify operational bryophyte indicators of forest integrity. Along with a standardized protocol to select and calibrate such indicators, we urgently require strategic research to compile data on undisturbed reference forests on which to base selection of endpoints; species-specific ecological tolerances, with consideration of complex interactions; mechanisms of response to disturbance, with consideration of temporal aspects; population viability thresholds; and recruitment effects on community assembly. Whether we succeed in finding bryophyte indicators of forest integrity, this research would also provide the data to monitor and interpret the integrity of the bryophyte community.

AB  - The identification, remedial treatment, and monitoring of contaminated sediments are among the priorities for managers of the Tampa Bay Estuary. Tampa Bay, as an urbanized estuary, is subject to the input of watershed sources of chemical contaminants, including metals, pesticides, and organic chemicals. Although the use of biological indicators and their incorporation into multi-metric indices is not new, the refinement and applications of such techniques for determining environmental condition still require further development and exploration. We present a single Tampa Bay Benthic Index (TBBI) that was developed specifically for Tampa Bay. Stepwise discriminant analysis was applied to a comprehensive list of potential benthic metrics. Results from the stepwise procedure identified the metrics that best discriminated between "healthy" and "degraded" conditions, as defined by sediment contaminant effect levels and dissolved oxygen. Discriminant analysis was then applied to the resultant three variables to determine the linear combination for the index. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present paper examined the applicability of a holistic stochastic dynamic methodology (SDM) in predicting the tendencies of simple ecological indicators as a response to the changes in agricultural hedgerow networks. Although considerable effort has been made to identify appropriate agri-environmental indicators, yet most of them are far too complex to be comprehensively measured and quantified by non-specialists. The ecological integrity of the typical hedgerows can be partly assessed by the observation of the occurrence of passerine indicators. Since the conventional measures' regarding bird studies requires high-specialization levels, we proposed alternative simple, suitable and intuitive indicators capable of responding with comparable rigour to key changes in such agro-ecosystems. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between conceptually isolated key-components of the studied hedgerows. The final model provided some basis to analyse the responses of simple passerine indicators to the agricultural scenarios that will characterize the region. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the SDM reliability in capturing the habitat dynamics of the studied agro-ecosystems by predicting the behavioural pattern for simple measures, roughly associated with bird occurrence, habitat food resources and breeding conditions.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the appropriate electrofishing distance for estimating fish assemblage richness in temperate North American streams. We tested whether electrofishing 40 times the mean wetted channel width was sufficient for estimating species richness and developing precise metrics for Atlantic Forest streams in southeastern Brazil. We sampled 32 sites with differing gradients, substrates, and anthropogenic pressures. Our results show that 40 channel widths were not sufficient to estimate species richness in those systems, presumably because of the high number of rare species. However, 40 channel widths were sufficient for applying other metrics of assemblage condition (e.g., number of common species, percentage of tolerant individuals, percentage of Characiform species, percentage of Siluriform species, percentage of water column species, percentage benthic species, Shannon diversity, dominance). This suggests that 40 channel widths are an appropriate sampling distance for applying environmental assessment protocols to Atlantic Forest streams.

AB  - The impact of mechanical site preparation (MSP) on soil biogeochemical structure in young larch plantations was investigated. Soil samples were collected in replicated plots comprising simple trenching, double trenching, mounding and inverting site preparation. Unlogged natural mixed forest areas were used as a reference. Analysis of soil nutrients, abundance of bacteria and gas exchanges unveiled no significant difference among the plots. However, inverting site preparation resulted in higher variations of gas exchanges when compared with trenching, mounding and unlogged natural forest. A combination of the biological and physicochemical variables was used to define a multifunctional classification of the soil samples into four distinct groups categorized as a function of their deviation from baseline ecological conditions. According to this classification model, simple trenching was the approach that represented the lowest ecological risk potential at the microsite level. No relationship was observed between MSP method and soil bacterial community structure as assessed by high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene; however, indicator genotypes were identified for each multifunctional soil class. This is the first identification of multifunctional molecular indicators for baseline and disturbed ecological conditions in soil, demonstrating the potential of applied microbial ecology to guide silvicultural practices and ecological risk assessment.

AB  - The analysis of functional trait-habitat relationships has been used to measure the degree to which environmental factors influence the assembly of ecological communities. In the Parkland and Grassland natural regions of Alberta, wetlands are embedded in a matrix of human modified landscapes. The extent and effects of land uses on the condition of these wetlands and plant assemblages remains largely unknown. We used the physicochemical characteristics and plant functional traits collected in 322 wetlands as indicators of wetland condition. Plant functional traits included origin, life history, and habitat requirements. Physico-chemical characteristics at each wetland site were assessed and the intensity of land use quantified within a 250-meter buffer. Our analyses reveal that functional plant traits are impacted by surrounding land use intensity; the abundance of non-native (exotic), upland, and annual plants tend to increase with degree of agriculture. Wetlands in areas with abundant groundwater input (low isotopic oxygen-18 enrichment) tend to be associated with functional groups preferring stable hydrological conditions including perennials and upland species. This contrasts with wetlands with greater potential for evaporation which were shallower, had higher nutrient levels, and were positively associated with species tolerating higher levels of disturbances, such as annuals. Our study demonstrates how an understanding of plant functional trait-habitat relationship can provide a framework for linking the responses of taxonomically-unrelated plant species to the condition of wetlands, and ultimately be used as indicator of wetland condition.

AB  - Urbanisation in South Africa has resulted in the degradation of aquatic ecosystems across a rural-to-urban gradient; impacting the availability of clean water. Biological organisms, including fish assemblages, have been used as indicators of environmental change, as part of monitoring programmes designed to protect and improve aquatic ecosystem conditions. However, the effectiveness of individual freshwater fish species as bio-indicators for urban impacts has not yet been evaluated. This study investigated the occurrence of freshwater fish species across three urban gradients within the upper Crocodile River sub-management area as potential bio-indicators. Having collected presence and absence data, five native fish species were determined to be widespread. Their effectiveness as bio-indicators for six environmental drivers, identified through principle component analysis, was assessed using species stressor-response curves derived from logistic regression analysis. Of the five species, the largescale yellowfish (Labeobarbus marequensis) and stargazer catfish (Amphilius uranoscopus) showed potential to be effective bio-indicators for urban impacts on aquatic water quality and instream habitat. These taxa, as effective urban bio-indicators, have the potential to improve the efficiency of urban river health assessments through reducing data gathering and staff training requirements.

AB  - Ecological integrity (EI), a concept referring to the structural and functional components of ecosystems, which is closely related to the integrity and stability of biotic communities, has deteriorated markedly in freshwater ecosystems across the globe. In New Zealand, many deep lakes appear to have been affected to a lesser extent by anthropogenic activities. The objective of this study was to identify and quantify a range of key in-lake indicators that could be used to report El for deep New Zealand lakes, many of which may be expected to have high El values. Individual indicators of El in the lakes were related statistically to selected anthropogenic pressure indicators. Values of El were only weakly related to the anthropogenic pressure indicators, and catchment and lake morphometric and climate characteristics were strong moderators of the relationship and suggests that monitoring of El requires careful consideration of natural variability amongst different lake ecosystems. Physico-chemical indicators of El tended to be more closely related to anthropogenic pressure indicators than biological El indicators. Monitoring of physico-chemical and biological indicators in a set of reference lakes largely devoid of anthropogenic influences will help to better define elements of El which include "nativeness", "pristineness", diversity and resilience.

AB  - This study examined the non-stationary relationship between the ecological condition of streams and the proportions of forest and developed land in watersheds using geographically-weighted regression (GWR). Most previous studies have adopted the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, which assumes stationarity of the relationship between land use and biological indicators. However, these conventional OLS models cannot provide any insight into local variations in the land use effects within watersheds. Here, we compared the performance of the OLS and GWR statistical models applied to benthic diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish communities in sub-watershed management areas. We extracted land use datasets from the Ministry of Environment LULC map and data on biological indicators in Nakdong river systems from the National Aquatic Ecological Monitoring Program in Korea. We found that the GWR model had superior performance compared with the OLS model, as assessed based on R-2, Akaike's Information Criterion, and Moran's I values. Furthermore, GWR models revealed specific localized effects of land use on biological indicators, which we investigated further. The results of this study can be used to inform more effective policies on watershed management and to enhance ecological integrity by prioritizing sub-watershed management areas

AB  - Biological indicators are being increasingly used to rapidly monitor changing river quality. Among these bioindicators are macroinvertebrates. A short-coming of macroinvertebrate rapid assessments is that they use higher taxa, and therefore lack taxonomic resolution and species-specific responses. One subset of invertebrate taxa is the Odonata, which as adults, are sensitive indicators of both riparian and river conditions. Yet adult Odonata are not necessarily an umbrella taxon for all other taxa. Therefore, we investigated whether the two metrics of aquatic macroinvertebrate higher taxa and adult odonate species might complement each other, and whether together they provide better clarity on river health and integrity than one subset alone. Results indicated that both metrics provide a similar portrait of large-scale, overall river conditions. At the smaller spatial scale of parts of rivers, Odonata were highly sensitive to riparian vegetation, and much more so than macroinvertebrate higher taxa. Odonate species were more sensitive to vegetation structure than they were to vegetation composition. Landscape context is also important, with the odonate assemblages at point localities being affected by the neighbouring dominant habitat type. Overall, benthic macroinvertebrates and adult Odonata species provide a highly complementary pair of metrics which together provide large spatial scale (river system) and small spatial scale (point localities) information on the impact of stressors such as riparian invasive alien trees. As adult Odonata are easy to sample and are sensitive to disturbance at both small and large spatial scales, they are valuable indicators for rapid assessment of river condition and riparian quality.

AB  - Biological indicators of stream condition are in use by water resource managers worldwide. The State of Maryland and man), other organizations that use Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) must determine when and how to refine their IBIs so that better stream condition information is provided. With completion of the second statewide round in 2004, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) had collected data from 2500 stream sites, more than doubling the number of sites that were available for the original IBI development. This larger dataset provided an opportunity for the MBSS to address the following shortcomings in the original IBIs: (1) substantial disturbance apparent in some reference sites, (2) fish IBIs could not be applied to very small streams, (3) natural variability within IBIs (based on regions) resulted in some stream types (e.g., coldwater and blackwater streams) receiving lower IBI scores and (4) one IBI was not able to discriminate degradation as desired (i.e., Coastal Plain fish IBI). Therefore, development of new fish and benthic macroinvertebrate IBIs was undertaken to achieve the goals of: (1) increased confidence that the reference conditions are minimally disturbed, (2) including more natural variation (such as stream size) across the geographic regions and stream types of Maryland and (3) increased sensitivity of IBIs by using more classes (strata) and different metric combinations. New fish IBIs were developed for four geographical and stream type strata: Coastal Plain. Eastern Piedmont, warmwater Highlands and coldwater Highlands streams; new benthic macroinvertebrate IBIs were developed for three geographical strata: Coastal Plain, Eastern Piedmont and Highlands streams. The addition of one new fish IBI and one new benthic macro invertebrate IBI partitioned natural variability into more homogeneous strata. At the same time, smaller streams (i.e., those draining catchments < 300 ac), which constituted a greater proportion of streams (25%) sampled in Round Two (2000-2004) than Round One (1995-1997), because of the finer map scale, were included in the reference conditions used to develop the new IBIs. The resulting new IBIs have high classification efficiencies of 83-96% and are well balanced between Type I and Type II errors. By scoring coldwater streams, smaller streams and to some extent blackwater streams higher, the new IBIs improve on the original IBIs. Overall, the new IBIs provide better assessments of stream condition to support sound management decisions, without requiring substantial changes by cooperating stream assessment programs.

AB  - Riparian zones are central landscape features providing several ecosystem services and are exceptionally rich in biodiversity. Despite their relatively low area coverage, riparian zones consequently represent a major concern for land and water resource managers confirmed within several European directives. These directives involve effective multi-scale monitoring to assess their conditions and their ability to carry out their functions. The objective of this research was to develop automated tools to provide from a single aerial LiDAR dataset new mapping tools and keystone riparian zone attributes assessing the ecological integrity of the riparian zone at a network scale (24 km).
   Different metrics were extracted from the original LiDAR point cloud, notably the Digital Terrain Model and Canopy Height Model rasters, allowing the extraction of riparian zones attributes such as the wetted channel (0.89 m; mean residual) and floodplain extents (6.02 m; mean residual). Different riparian forest characteristics were directly extracted from these layers (patch extent, overhanging character, longitudinal continuity, relative water level, mean and relative standard deviation of tree height). Within the riparian forest, the coniferous stands were distinguished from deciduous and isolated trees, with high accuracy (87.3%, Kappa index).
   Going further the mapping of the indicators, our study proposed an original approach to study the riparian zone attributes within different buffer width, from local scale (50 m long channel axis reach) to a network scale (ca. 2 km long reaches), using a disaggregation/re-agraggation process. This novel approach, combined to graphical presentations of the results allow natural resource managers to visualise the variation of upstream-downstream attributes and to identify priority action areas.
   In the case study, results showed a general decrease of the riparian forests when the river crosses built-up areas. They also highlighted the lower flooding frequency of riparian forest patches in habitats areas.
   Those results showed that LiDAR data can be used to extract indicators of ecological integrity of riparian zones in temperate climate zone.

AB  - Frameworks for assessing geomorphic river condition constitute a core part of the river management process, providing a critical platform for environmental decision-making and associated actions. The evolution of approaches for assessing the geomorphic (also called physical, morphological, or hydromorphological) condition of rivers has shifted from a design and development phase in the late-1990s and early 2000s to application and use of approaches for assessment, monitoring, and rehabilitation decision making. In this paper I review the core geomorphic principles that are embedded in more sophisticated, process-based frameworks, and demonstrate how the information generated through use of these frameworks can be used to guide management choices, change management activities or opt-out of management activities as part of precautionary river management practice. I propose that a key challenge now faced by geomorphologists and managers is to move beyond the development of more new frameworks, and consolidate efforts to use, test, and adapt existing approaches and datasets to achieve river management visions and objectives framed around improving river condition.

AB  - Forests are vital to maintaining headwater stream integrity in forested biomes, which ensures the delivery of aquatic ecosystem services downstream. Forest harvesting, however, can alter land-water linkages and compromise stream integrity. Historically, the main effects of forestry on streams have been documented by studies that used relatively few (mainly abiotic) indicators and which focused on single harvesting events. However, forest management is expected to intensify in the future to meet increasing global wood demand and it is likely that our present understanding does not adequately capture the cumulative effects that streams will be subjected to under intensive forest management. To address this, we assessed the effects of varying forest management intensities on the integrity of 15 forest headwater streams in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. We used a comprehensive approach to link multiple biotic and abiotic indicators of stream ecosystem integrity to reach- and catchment-level characteristics including forest management (e.g., cumulative harvesting over time, road density, forest condition). Most indicators detected the gradient in forest management intensity with abiotic indicators responding most strongly. Streams in catchments with highest management intensity (especially road density) tended to have higher fine inorganic sediment deposition and entrainment, water cations and carbon, dissolved organic matter humification, and water temperature. These abiotic differences were associated with higher biofilm biomass and shredder densities, but lower leaf decomposition. Evidence from our multi-indicator approach elucidated a potential effects pathway of higher inorganic sediment content in biofilms of organic matter potentially limiting or altering its use by microbial and benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities and resulting in reduced leaf decomposition rates. Overall, this study shows that current best management practices in an intensively managed watershed (and legacy effects from past management such as older road systems) do not fully protect against an increased delivery of terrestrial materials to streams with resulting habitat and biotic changes, but that they are mostly effective at preventing the impairment of BMI communities.

AB  - The development of methods to assess ecological integrity of running waters requires integrating physical and chemical parameters, as well as their effects upon biological structure, diversity and processes. River management in the U.K. has seen the development of a series of quality assessment methodologies with little integration between them. Methods which assess habitat structure in a biologically meaningful way offer the best approach to integrating measures of the effects of physical and chemical processes upon the river environment. Simultaneous measurement of surface flow types ('flow biotopes') and habitat structure ('functional habitats') showed clear links. These links could form the first stage in the development of a rapid, cost-effective measure of ecological integrity in rivers of the U.K.

AB  - In spite of a relatively good knowledge of the odonatofauna of the Maghreb, some large areas like the centre of Algeria have remained little explored. These areas have witnessed a demographic explosion and an agro-industrial development over the last century which have adversely impacted most natural ecosystems. Wadi El Harrach, an intermittent river that cuts through the Mitidja plain, near Algiers, is notorious for its pollution and represents a good model to investigate anthropogenic impacts on freshwater communities. In line with the increasing use of assessment methods developed to monitor and evaluate the ecological integrity of running waters, we sampled Odonata of Wadi El Harrach and measured various abiotic parameters representative of the water quality of the habitat. Both data sets were jointly used to analyse the correspondence between the two assessments. Results indicated congruence between both approaches and highlighted the potential of Odonata as reliable bioindicators of ecological conditions of lotic ecosystems.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach to environmental accounting useful for studying the feasibility of socioeconomic systems in relation to the external constraints posed by ecological compatibility. The approach is based on a multi-scale analysis of the metabolic pattern of ecosystems and societies and it provides an integrated characterization of the resulting interaction. The text starts with a theoretical part explaining (i) the implicit epistemological revolution implied by the notion of ecosystem metabolism and the fund flow model developed by Georgescu-Roegen applied to environmental accounting, and (ii) the potentials of this approach to create indicators to assess ecological integrity and environmental impacts. This revolution also makes it possible to carry out a multi-scale integrated assessment of ecosystem and societal metabolisms at the territorial level. In the second part, two applications of this approach using an indicator of the negentropic cost show the possibility to characterize in quantitative and qualitative terms degrees of alteration (crop cultivation, tree plantations) for different biomes (tropical and boreal forests). Also, a case study for land use scenarios has been included. The proposed approach represents an integrated multi-scale tool for the analysis of nature conservation scenarios and strategies.

AB  - Increasingly, natural resources agencies and organizations are using measures of ecological integrity to monitor and evaluate the status and condition of their landscapes, and numerous methods have been developed to map the pattern of human activities. In this paper I apply formal methods from decision theory to develop a transparent ecological indicator of landscape integrity. I developed a parsimonious set of stressors using an existing framework to minimize redundancy and overlap, mapping each variable as an individual data layer with values from 0 to 1.0, and then combined them using an "increasive" function called fuzzy sum. A novel detailed land use dataset is used to generate empirical measures of the degree of human modification to map important stressors such as land use, land cover, and presence, use, and distance from roads. I applied this general framework to the US and found that the overall average degree of human modification was 0.375. Regional variation was fairly predictable, but aggregation of these raw values into terrestrial or watershed units resulted in large differences at local to regional scales. I discuss three uses of these data by land managers to manage protected areas within a dynamic landscape context. This approach generates an internally-valid model that has a direct, empirical, and physical basis to estimate the degree of human modification.

AB  - Sustainability and the health of freshwater ecosystems are vital to insure their safe and continued use. This study introduces a new approach to improve stream health to a desirable condition at the lowest cost by optimizing the best management practice (BMP) implementation plan. Several hydrological models including the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ( SWAT) and Hydrologic Index Tool were integrated and the results were used to develop a stream health model. SWAT model was calibrated and validated against daily streamflow data from nine US geological gauging stations for a 10-year-period while the stream health model was calibrated and validated against 193 biological monitoring sites operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. The stream health model was guided by a genetic algorithm to design the watershed-scale management strategies that included five BMPs. Out of 182 BMP implementation scenarios, eight unique scenarios resulted in an overall excellent stream health for the Honeyoey Creek-Pine Creek Watershed in Michigan. In addition, no tillage was the most selected BMP in three of the eight implementation scenarios. The BMP implementation costs for these eight scenarios ranged from 4.28 to 6.41 million dollars. Therefore, the integration of genetic algorithm techniques in stream health modeling resulted in a savings of over 2 million dollars. In addition, the implementation of the lowest costing scenario resulted in a 52% improvement and 36% reduction in stream health scores, with respect to stream length, compared to current conditions. The technique introduced here can be successfully adapted in different regions to identify the optimal solution from both environmental and economic points of view. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The assessment of the ecological conditions of rivers is crucial for their appropriate management and restoration. Bioindicators commonly used to evaluate the river status (i.e. diatoms, aquatic macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish) detect alterations of water quality, but are not particularly sensitive to hydromorphological degradation, which is another relevant pressure in river systems. Furthermore, those bioindicators are usually applied only to flowing channels. We developed a new multimetric index, the Odonate River Index (ORI), to assess the conditions of the whole corridor in alluvial rivers. The ORI is a development of an evaluation system proposed in Austria, and based on the Odonate Habitat Index (OHI). Odonates were chosen as bioindicators for the ecological integrity of the river corridor, since this taxon provides information on the conditions of their aquatic breeding sites, as well as on the surrounding terrestrial areas, due to its amphibiotic life cycle. We used a case study of 18 reaches from six Italian Alpine rivers, characterized by different morphological conditions and level of human impact. Within each study reach, we selected four sites, both lotic and lentic sites. Dragonfly surveys consisted in field observation of adults, and collection of larvae and exuviae. To define the best sampling strategy, we compared the results of the ORI metrics obtained varying the input data by combining different sampling methods: the best compromise between effort and exhaustiveness was obtained coupling the observation of adults with the collection of exuviae. We found the ORI to be a robust and reliable tool to assess the status of the river corridor in a wide range of environmental conditions and river morphology, being particularly suitable to detect hydromorphological degradation and alterations of the structure of aquatic and riparian vegetation. We identified two limiting factors for the applicability of this index: low water temperatures of the main channel (i.e. mean annual value below 10 degrees C) and river reaches with no or scarce aquatic and riparian vegetation. In addition to the assessment of river conditions, the ORI could also be applied for monitoring the effects of river restoration actions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A healthy stream is an ecosystem that is sustainable and resilient, maintaining its ecological structure and function over time while continuing to meet societal needs and expectations. The concept described in this paper explicitly incorporates both ecological integrity (maintaining structure and function) and human Values (what society Values in the ecosystem). Stream ecologists who want their research to contribute to improving conditions in flowing waters require concepts Like stream health, which will stimulate research in directions that will be more effective in restoring and preserving the unique organisms and ecosystems they study. Determining what is a healthy stream requires integration of stream ecology with disciplines such as economics and political science, because a concept of stream health must take into account the human attitudes and social institutions that are a part of the stream's societal watershed. New and fruitful directions for stream research lie in developing operational measures of stream health, which include the human dimension and move beyond identifying symptoms of ecological stress, and in elucidating the ecological processes and human actions that maintain stream health.

AB  - A fuzzy adaptive management framework is proposed for evaluating the vulnerability of an ecosystem to losing ecological integrity as a result of climate change in an historical period (ex post evaluation) and selecting the best compensatory management action for reducing potential adverse impacts of future climate change on ecological integrity in a future period (ex ante evaluation). The ex post evaluation uses fuzzy logic to test hypotheses about the extent of past ecosystem vulnerability to losing ecological integrity and the ex ante evaluation uses the fuzzy minimax regret criterion to determine the best compensatory management action for alleviating potential adverse impacts of climate change on ecosystem vulnerability to losing ecological integrity in a future period. The framework accounts for uncertainty regarding: (1) the relationship between ecosystem vulnerability to losing ecological integrity and ecosystem resilience; (2) the relationship between ecosystem resilience and the extent to which observed indicators of ecological integrity depart from their thresholds; (3) the extent of future climate change; and (4) the potential impacts of future climate change on ecological integrity and ecosystem resilience. The adaptive management element of the framework involves using the ex post and ex ante evaluations iteratively in consecutive time segments of the future time period to determine if and when it is beneficial to adjust compensatory management actions to climate change. A constructed example is used to demonstrate the framework.

AB  - We developed a molecular biomarker system (MBS) to assess the physiological status of Palaomenetes pugio (grass shrimp) challenged with exposure to heat stress, cadmium, atrazine, and the water-accommodating fraction of either diesel fuel or bunker fuel No. 2. The MBS assayed 9 specific cellular parameters of shrimp that are indicative of a nonstressed or stressed condition: heat-shock protein 60, heat-shock protein 70, alpha beta -crystallin homologue, lipid peroxide, total glutathione level, ubiquitin, mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase, metallothionein, and cytochrome P-450 2E homologue. Using these 9 parameters, the MBS can distinguish between the responses to each stressor, and to the nonstressed control conditions. The MBS was able to determine the structural integrity of the cell as defined by protein turnover, protein chaperoning, and lipid composition via lipid peroxide levels, and the status of key metabolic processes such as cytoskeletal integrity and glutathione redox potential. This technology aids in the accurate diagnosis of the health of shrimp because the physiological significance of changes of each parameter is well known. This technology is particularly relevant for environmental monitoring because grass shrimp are used as key indicator species in many estuarine ecosystems. Finally, this system is easy to implement, precise, and can be quickly adapted to an automated high-throughput system for mass sample analysis.

AB  - Wetlands are one of the most valuable natural resources on earth and play an important role in preserving biodiversity. However, due to economic development and human disturbances, many wetlands across the world have deteriorated and disappeared over the past several decades. By using remote sensing images and point of interest (POI) data, we proposed a knowledge-based raster mapping (KBRM)-based framework and implemented it in the assessment of wetland ecological conditions in Suzhou, China. Density maps of waterbodies, vegetation covers, imperviousness, roads, and POI values were derived and used as five ecological indicators that can represent the ecological conditions of wetlands. The KBRM approach was used to integrate these indicators into an overall rating and map wetland ecological conditions efficiently. Thus, spatial variations in wetland ecological conditions can be distinguished and represented in detail. Cross validation was conducted with water quality data at 15 field sampling sites. The validation results demonstrated that the overall wetland condition scores generated by our approach and the water quality index (WQI) values calculated from water quality data were strongly correlated. These findings confirm that our framework could be used to effectively map and evaluate spatial variations in wetland ecological conditions and provide more support for policy-making in wetland protection and management

AB  - A new approach to assess environmental integrity based on PRC analysis was proposed, tested, validated and developed. Environmental health assessment and community studies usually result in complex biological data sets. In order to find ecologically relevant patterns and tendencies from such sets of data it is necessary to reduce all the information to a summarised and simplified form, which might be more easily interpreted by ecologists, politicians, end-users and the population in general. However, several multivariate ordination methods currently used (e.g. redundancy analysis, principal component analysis, or multi-dimensional scaling) produce complex diagrams for the non-ecologist, which do not allow changes in biological communities over time to be easily understood. Here, we propose a recently developed method, principal response curves (PRC) analysis, to overcome these issues. This method has advantages over traditional ordination techniques, or any biotic index, in that it provides a powerful statistical analysis of temporal data series along spatial gradients. The PRC technique can make use of non-disturbed or unpolluted areas as reference sites with which other areas are compared, making it possible to assess changes in species composition between different areas over time. Moreover, individual species responses to stress agents can be inferred from the PRC curves. As well as providing insights into the behaviour of natural ecosystems - in particular, how ecosystem integrity changes over time - this new approach can potentially provide a practical tool for monitoring and implementing environmental policy instruments.

AB  - Structural and mechanical components in a nuclear Power plant are designed to operate for its entire service life. Recently, a number of nuclear power plants are being operated beyond their design life to produce more electricity without Shutting down. The critical issue in extending a lifetime is to maintain the level of safety during the extended operation period while satisfying the international regulatory standards. However, only a small portion of these components are of great importance for a significant aging degradation which Would deeply affect the long-term safety and reliability of the related facilities. Therefore, it is beneficial to build a monitoring system to measure an aging status. While a number of integrity evaluation systems have been developed for NPPs, a real-time aging monitoring system has not been proposed yet [1-8]. This paper proposes an expert system for the integrity evaluation of nuclear power plants based on a Web-based Reality Environment (WRE). The proposed system provides the integrity assessment for the major mechanical components of a nuclear power plant under concurrent working environments. In the WRE, it is possible for users to understand a mechanical system such as its size, geometry, coupling condition etc. In conclusion, it is anticipated that the proposed system can be used for a more efficient integrity evaluation of the major components subjected to an aging degradation.

AB  - The ecological condition of tropical Andean rivers are threatened by many human activities including changes in land use and cover in watersheds. Current protocols diagnose the structural condition of streams but not their function. In this study we proposed an assessment tool using the leaf-litter breakdown as a measure of the functional condition and health of high Andean streams in Southern Ecuador, including methodology and threshold values adapted to local conditions. We selected 15 streams in three micro-basins (Mazan, Llaviuco and Matadero) within or in the vicinity of Cajas National Park where we deployed litterbags for 15, 28 and 64 days. We used two types of mesh (coarse and fine) for the litterbags in order to separate the contribution of macro -invertebrates and microorganisms in the decomposition process and also tested two different leaf substrates: Alder (Alnus acuminate) and Miconia (Miconia bracteolata). In each collection period we determined physical and chemical parameters, applied the riparian quality index (QBR-And) and river habitat index (IHF). Decomposition rates (-k) were determined from the time period at which approximately 50 % ash -free mass would have been lost. We used K-total and the ratio of the rate of decomposition between coarse and fine mesh (K-g/K-f to define the functional condition thresholds. To test the metrics sensitivity we used graphical methods, one-way ANOVA and discriminative efficiency (ED). The analysis of watershed land-use and cover showed a gradient of intervention: Matadero > Llaviuco > Mazan. The composition of the environmental variables of Mazan streams were different with respect to Llaviuco and Matadero, whose values were similar to each other. The QBR-And index showed a significant gradient from very low levels in Matadero (27.5), moderately high values in Llaviuco (66.5) to high values in Mazan (87). Alder leaf -litter breakdown rates were significantly faster in Mazan than in Matadero and Llaviuco streams, while breakdown rates of Miconia were not significantly different among watersheds. The Kg/Kr ratio was significantly higher in Mazan compared to Llaviuco and Matadero, which did not differ. We consider the Kg/Kr metric sensitive enough to discriminate impacts in the studied areas. Our results support the use of the leaf-litter breakdown as an appropriate tool to assess functional ecological condition, complementing the structural assessments of these Andean rivers.

AB  - Epilithic bacterial community viability was assessed on natural biofilm assemblages from environmentally contrasting locations over a 17-months period to determine if it reflects environmental conditions or conditions within the biofilm assemblage. Vital state was assessed by membrane integrity using LIVE/DEAD(A (R)) BacLight (TM) staining kit. Samples were regularly collected in a large river, up and downstream of a large urban centre. Epilithic biomasses were similar between sites irrespective of the distinct water quality but varied temporarily, peaking up to 48 g AFDM m(-2). Bacterial community composition assessed by 16S rDNA based PCR-DGGE significantly differed between sites. Bacterial densities (median of 2.5 x 10(11) cell g AFDM(-1)) were stable whatever the sample origin or biomass. Viable bacterial fractions ranged between 13 and 83% of the total bacterial densities and were correlated with hydrological stability indicators (average of 41.9% during stable water periods, 62.4% during intermediate flow regimes and 50.0% during flow instability) and seasonal parameters. At the river section and epilithic community scales, consistent bacterial densities per unit of biomass could reflect a biofilm assemblage carrying capacity while variable membrane integrity likely integrates changes in the vital state of the community under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates communities are the most consistently emphasized biotic component of aquatic ecosystems and are one of the biological indicators required for assessment by the European Water Framework Directive. In this context, several indices based on these communities have been developed in order to assess ecological quality of estuarine systems. In the present work we used AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX and BAT to distinguish ecological status of five small estuarine systems of the Portuguese south and southwest coasts. Although indices outputs did not differ between systems and sampling seasons, results indicated that the metrics in which these indices are based could differentiate community structures as a result of two main gradients that force these communities: the natural variability, and the anthropogenic impact.

AB  - The investigation of the 52 largest Austrian rivers with catchment areas > 500 km(2) (Danube River excluded) provides a national estimate of the ecological status of Austria's rivers and an example of the current status of European alpine rivers. Emphasis is placed on evaluation criteria, such as morphological character, instream structures, longitudinal river corridor, lateral connectivity and hydrological regime compared with original conditions. This assessment and evaluation of nearly 5000 river kilometers identifies the remaining river stretches with high habitat quality as well as those stretches that have been altered by systematic channelisation or hydropower development. Altogether, about 80% (3900 km) of the stretches in Austria's 'larger' rivers are moderately to heavily impacted by human activity and thus no longer correspond to their original channel form and dynamics. Impoundment, water diversion and hydropeaking each impact the hydrology of approximately 20% of the above stretches. Only about 20% of all investigated river stretches can still be classified as having high or good habitat quality and as retaining essentially natural functions. Using natural conditions as a reference, the most severe losses have occurred in reaches that were originally braided or meandering. Analysing the amount of unaltered river stretches according to biocoenotic regions, 37% (523 km) of the originally rhithral (trout) region (1416 km) and 18% (480 km) of the originally hyporhithral (grayling) region (2739 km) remain today in high or good habitat quality. Only a few intact river stretches (totaling 43 km) can be found along formerly potamal river reaches (731 km). These data underline the rarity and, therefore, national importance of the remaining unspoiled aquatic habitats. The results presented here form a basis for water resource management and nature conservation strategies, as well as for restoration programs. In particular, these investigations help to fulfill the requirements of the EU-Water Framework Directive by assisting to delineate and characterise reference sites of different river types.

AB  - Since European settlement, over 50 % of coastal wetlands have been lost in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, causing growing concern and increased monitoring by government agencies. For over a decade, monitoring efforts have focused on the development of regional and organism-specific measures. To facilitate collaboration and information sharing between public, private, and government agencies throughout the Great Lakes basin, we developed standardized methods and indicators used for assessing wetland condition. Using an ecosystem approach and a stratified random site selection process, birds, anurans, fish, macroinvertebrates, vegetation, and physico-chemical conditions were sampled in coastal wetlands of all five Great Lakes including sites from the United States and Canada. Our primary objective was to implement a standardized basin-wide coastal wetland monitoring program that would be a powerful tool to inform decision-makers on coastal wetland conservation and restoration priorities throughout the Great Lakes basin.

AB  - Small Mediterranean streams are shaped by predictable seasonal events of flooding and drying over an annual cycle, and present a strong inter and intra-annual variation in flow regime. Native fish assemblages in these streams are adapted to this natural environmental variability. The distinction of human-induced disturbances from the natural ones is thus a crucial step before assessing the ecological status of these streams. In this aim, the present study evaluates the effects of natural hydrological variability on fish assemblages from disturbed and least disturbed sites in small intermittent streams of south Portugal. Data were collected over the last two decades (1996-2011) in 14 sites located in the Guadiana and Sado river basins. High variability of fish assemblages was strongly dependent on human-induced disturbances, particularly nutrient/organic load and sediment load, and on natural hydrological variability. Natural hydrological variability can act jointly with anthropogenic disturbances, producing changes on fish assemblages structure of small intermittent streams. In least disturbed sites, despite the natural disturbances caused by inter-annual rainfall variations (including drought and flood events), fish assemblages maintained a long-term stability and revealed a high resilience. On the contrary, disturbed sites presented significantly higher variability on fish assemblages and a short and long-term instability, reflecting a decrease on the resistance and resilience of fish assemblages. Under these conditions, fish fauna integrity is particularly vulnerable and the ecological assessment may be influenced by natural hydrological variations. High hydrological variability (especially if it entails high frequency of dryer years and meaningful cumulative water deficit) may affect the impact of the human pressures with significant and consistent consequences on fish assemblage composition and integrity. In this study, fish metrics that maximize the detection of human degradation and minimize the response to natural variability were based on the relative abundance of native species (insectivorous species, eurytopic species, water column species, native lithophilic species), relative abundance of species with intermediate tolerance and relative number of exotic species. Results highlight the importance of assessing temporal variability on stream biomonitoring programs and emphasize the need to improve the assessment tools, accounting for long-term changes in fish assemblages, namely by selecting the most appropriate fish metrics that respond to anthropogenic disturbances but exhibit low natural temporal variability, essential both in the characterization of the biological reference conditions and in the development of fish indexes in intermittent streams.

AB  - Biological assessments of river conditions are increasingly conducted at regional and continental scales that match the extent of large-scale river management efforts. Multimetric indices composed of biological community indicators are commonly used to assess ecological condition and indices have recently been applied in large regions. Methods for large-scale multimetric index creation emphasize repeatability, comparability across regions, and objective selection of candidate metrics. Here we used an extensive fish dataset to create a large pool of fish community metrics which were screened to create multimetric indices (MMIs) in eight ecoregions covering the conterminous U.S. Candidate metrics were tested for metric range, corrected for natural gradients using boosted regression trees, and then tested for repeatability and sensitivity to landscape disturbance. Temporally stable and repeatable metrics were then evaluated for redundancy and used to compose MMIs for each region. Our MMIs were significantly correlated to independently developed MMIs, accurately reproducing prior index values with moderate to high precision and little bias. Our study demonstrates the utility of boosted regression tree models for correcting metric values for natural abiotic gradients and shows that the order of screening tests has a potentially important influence on metric selection. The resultant regional indices and component metrics provide a basis for assessing condition and testing hypotheses about landscape influences on aquatic ecosystems at a national scale in the US.

AB  - Streams and rivers provide important services to humans, and therefore, their ecological integrity should be a societal goal. Although ecological integrity encompasses structural and functional integrity, stream bioassessment rarely considers ecosystem functioning. Organic matter decomposition and ecosystem metabolism are prime candidate indicators of stream functional integrity, and here we review each of these functions, the methods used for their determination, and their strengths and limitations for bioassessment. We also provide a systematic review of studies that have addressed organic matter decomposition (88 studies) and ecosystem metabolism (50 studies) for stream bioassessment since the year 2000. Most studies were conducted in temperate regions. Bioassessment based on organic matter decomposition mostly used leaf litter in coarse-mesh bags, but fine-mesh bags were also common, and cotton strips and wood were frequent in New Zealand. Ecosystem metabolism was most often based on the open-channel method and used a single-station approach. Organic matter decomposition and ecosystem metabolism performed well at detecting environmental change (approximate to 75% studies), with performances varying between 50 and 100% depending on the type of environmental change; both functions were sensitive to restoration practices in 100% of the studies examined. Finally, we provide examples where functional tools are used to complement the assessments of stream ecological integrity. With this review, we hope to facilitate the widespread incorporation of ecosystem processes into bioassessment programs with the broader aim of more effectively managing stream and river ecosystems.

AB  - In order to establish a comparison between public perception and instream field assessments of ecosystem quality, the results from two years of bioassessment from Clear Creek Watershed, located in the Ozark Highlands Ecoregion of northwest Arkansas, United States, were compared to results from a mail-out survey conducted within the same watershed during the same time frame. The Environmental Protection Agency Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP) was used to conduct a bioassessment of the watershed, and results were compared to stakeholder perceptions of the watershed's ecosystem integrity. The results indicated that respondents significantly overestimated or underestimated ecosystem integrity and tended to disagree with bioassessment results from each site sampled in the watershed. Disparity between perception and scientifically assessed ecosystem integrity was observed regardless of respondent residence location or knowledge of factual information regarding ecosystem processes. However, respondents with lifestyles that tended to connect them to watershed ecosystem processes were more likely to rank ecosystem quality similarly to the results attained through the bioassessments used for this study Perceptions among respondents in this study suggest a disconnection between ecosystem processes and the everyday lives of residents of Clear Creek Watershed. Understanding how well public perception agrees with scientific information provides insight into environmental education and policy initiatives that strive to conserve ecosystem services. As a result, conservation initiatives should be developed in such a way as to reduce the disparity between public perception of watershed ecosystem integrity and the scientific assessments that help communities understand how to Manage and conserve those systems. If perception is not taken into consideration, there is a danger in creating policy or developing programs that are not compatible with stakeholder expectations or ecosystem function.

AB  - Ecological assessments and monitoring programs often rely on indicators to evaluate environmental conditions. Such indicators are frequently developed by scientists, expressed in technical language, and target aspects of the environment that scientists consider useful. Yet setting environmental policy priorities and making environmental decisions requires both effective communication of environmental information to decision makers and consideration of what members of the public value about ecosystems. However, the complexity of ecological issues, and the ways in which they are often communicated, make it difficult for these parties to fully engage such a dialogue. This paper describes our efforts to develop a process for translating the indicators of regional ecological condition used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency into common language for communication with public and decision-making audiences. A series of small-group sessions revealed that people did not want to know what these indicators measured, or how measurements were performed. Rather, respondents wanted to know what such measurements can tell them about environmental conditions. Most positively received were descriptions of the kinds of information that various combinations of indicators provide about broad ecological conditions. Descriptions that respondents found most appealing contained general reference to both the set of indicators from which the information was drawn and aspects of the environment valued by society to which the information could be applied. These findings can assist with future efforts to communicate scientific information to nontechnical audiences, and to represent societal values in ecological programs by improving scientist-public communication.

AB  - Protecting the health of streams and rivers requires identifying ecologically significant attributes of the natural flow regime. Streamflow regimes are routinely quantified using a plethora of hydrologic metrics (HMs), most of which have unknown relevance to biological communities. At regional and national scales, we evaluated which of 509 commonly used HMs were associated with biological indicators of fish and invertebrate community integrity. We quantified alteration of each HM by using statistical models to predict site-specific natural baseline values for each of 728 sites across the USA where streamflow monitoring data were available concurrent with assessments of invertebrate or fish community integrity. We then ranked HMs according to their individual association with biological integrity based on random forest models that included HMs and other relevant covariates, such as land cover and stream chemistry. HMs were generally the most important predictors of biological integrity relative to the covariates. At a national scale, the most influential HMs were measures of depleted high flows, homogenization of flows, and erratic flows. Unique combinations of biologically relevant HMs were apparent among regions. We discuss the implications of our findings to the challenge of selecting HMs for streamflow research and management.

AB  - Global environmental monitoring has indicated that the structure and function of some aquatic ecosystems has been significantly altered by human activities. There are many potential causes for these changes; however, one major concern is the increasing release of anthropogenic contaminants into aquatic environments. Although toxicological responses of individual organisms are typically well characterized, few studies have focused on characterizing toxicity at the ecosystem level. In fact, because of their scale and complexity, changes in ecosystem integrity are rarely considered in assessments of risks to ecosystems. This work attempts to move the conversation forward by defining integrity of ecosystems, reviewing current and historical approaches to measuring ecosystem integrity status (e.g., structural and functional measurements), and highlighting methods that could significantly contribute to the field of ecosystem toxicology (e.g., keystone species, environmental energetics, ecotoxicological modeling, and adverse outcome pathways [AOPs]). Through a critical analysis of current and historical methodologies, the present study offers a comprehensive, conceptual framework for the assessment of risks of contaminant exposure for whole ecosystems and proposes steps to facilitate better diagnoses of the integrity of aquatic systems.

AB  - Our objective is to summarize scientific knowledge concerning assessment methods addressing ecological integrity in wetlands and riparian zones, with an emphasis on riparian areas. This article examines which indicators (abiotic parameters, species, faunistic and floristic communities and functional assemblages) are used, how they are applied (single or integrative indicator), and which assessment algorithms and models have been successful to date. Overall, our review shows that despite the relatively recent emergence of riparian ecology, riparian assessments are better developed than the wetland functional assessments currently employed. In general, it is recommended that useful methods be updated and cross-calibrated, that new rapid assessment methods provide reasonable levels of accuracy for a variety of users in a variety of situations, that assessment be developed for specific applications (with identified users), that uncertainty be explicitly acknowledged, that the policy implications of specific assessments methods be openly discussed, and that methods be formally tested for accuracy, cost and practicality. In addition, we offer a revised protocol for the effective and rapid assessment of functional integrity in riparian environments associated with freshwater ecosystems. This protocol encourages the use of terrestrialization, canopy development, biodiversity, microclimate and seston as integrative indicators of integrity.

AB  - Landscape morphology of a watershed plays an important role on determination of the ecological health in the stream or river ecosystems. A habitat-riparian index system (HIS) is a newly developed metric to estimate stream naturalness in Korea. In this study, we focus on a predictive assessment of the HIS associated with stream integrity, and then aim to evaluate essential features of the stream integrity in conjunction with ambient land use patterns obtained from geographical information system (GIS). Concerning the stream health assessment, we applied a decision-tree model to the HIS prediction. As a results, the best models of the decision-trees exhibited a 72.2% accuracy in prediction of the stream health index, and also a 65.8% accuracy in classifying river catchments. A hierarchical structure of the decision-tree models in effect, was able to identify and classify more influential land use patterns that could reflex stream integrity. We highlight that GIS-involved analyses and approaches accommodates a wide variety of benefits in a rapid assessment of ecological data associated with field measurements. Furthermore, such methodological applications will be able to become an effective alternative for efficient ecological health assessment in streams and rivers.

AB  - Personnel selection research has seen an increasing interest in integrity tests. Although these tests have been found to predict a variety of workplace criteria, a long-standing criticism of integrity tests is their criterion-focussed nature. A construct-oriented approach to integrity test development involves identifying important elements of integrity and developing content to reflect those elements. Drawing upon earlier attempts to define integrity, this paper conceptualizes integrity as a behavior, and elaborates on two definitional elements, nature of standards and their referent. Undertaking a content analysis of the high-level codes of conduct of 13 military nations, this paper illustrates the application of an approach to defining integrity for use in the military context. It includes a discussion on the operationalization of integrity for assessment purposes, highlighting considerations that must be given to all aspects of the assessment development process.

AB  - Diatom-based indicators can contribute significantly to comprehensive assessments of stream biological conditions. We used modeling to develop, evaluate, and compare 2 types of diatom-based indicators for Idaho streams: an observed/expected (O/E) ratio of taxon loss derived from a model similar to the River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System (RIVPACS) and a multimetric index (MMI). Modeling the effects of natural environmental gradients on assemblage composition is a key component of RIVPACS, but modeling has seldom been used for MMI development. Diatom assemblage structure varied substantially among reference-site samples, but neither ecoregion nor bioregion accounted for a significant portion of that variation. Therefore, we used Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to model the variation of individual metrics with natural gradients. For both CART and RIVPACS modeling, we restricted predictors to natural variables unaffected by or resistant to human disturbances. On average, 46% of the total variance in 32 metrics could be explained by CART models, but the predictor variables differed among the metrics and often showed evidence of interacting with one another. The use of CART residuals (i.e., metric values adjusted for the effect of natural environmental gradients) affected whether or how strongly many metrics discriminated between reference and test sites. We used cluster analysis to examine redundancies among candidate metrics and then selected the metric with the highest discrimination efficiency from each cluster. This step was applied to both unadjusted and adjusted metrics and led to inclusion of 7 metrics in MMIs. Adjusted MMIs were more precise than unadjusted ones (coefficient of variation similar to 50% lower). Adjusted and unadjusted MMIs rated similar proportions of the test sites as being in nonreference condition but disagreed on the assessment of many individual test sites. Use of unadjusted MMIs probably resulted in higher rates of both Type I and Type 11 errors than use of adjusted metrics, a logical consequence of the inability of unadjusted metrics to distinguish the confounding effects of natural environmental factors from those associated with human-caused stress. The RIVPACS-type model for diatom assemblages performed similarly to models developed for invertebrate assemblages. The O/E ratio was as precise as the adjusted MMI, but rated a lower proportion of test sites as being in nonreference condition, implying that taxon loss was less severe than changes in overall diatom assemblage structure. As previously demonstrated for O/E measures, modeling appears to be an effective means of developing more accurate and precise MMIs. Furthermore, modeling enabled us to develop a single MMI for use throughout an environmentally heterogeneous region.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the ichthyofauna structure in the region of the north outfall of the Bertioga Channel (Sao Paulo, Brazil) and the possible effects of the environmental quality loss. The samples were collected in a monthly basis, from September to December 2005, at two oceanographic stations with an otter-trawl. The fish fauna structure was evaluated by ecological indicators and the environmental quality evaluated by the ABC analysis and the Estuarine Fish Communities Index (EFCI). A total of 1553 individuals from 50 species were sampled. Ariidae and Sciaenidae amounted to 60 % and Cathorops spixii represented 36 % of all specimens collected. The highest richness and ecological diversity were recorded in December, while the highest numerical abundance was found in October. The majority of the species were represented by juveniles. The cluster analysis and canonical correspondence analysis showed a consistent and clear difference between the sampling stations, and the abiotic factors analyzed (temperature, depth and salinity) do not seem to have influence on the community structure. The ABC analysis suggested a moderate disturbed environment and the EFCI allowed classifying the area as "poor", due to the 12 metrics analyzed, concerning the reduction of the species diversity, composition and abundance, and modifications in the nursery function and trophic integrity of the area. Future studies should focus on jointly analyze chemical indicators of water and sediment with the biological indicators, to confirm the ichthyofaunal condition of the north outfall of the Bertioga Channel.

AB  - The city of La Plata, Argentina, is situated in a low alluvial zone, with streams having insufficient drainage into the Rio de la Plata estuary. In April 2013, a prodigious storm front caused unprecedented flooding in the city and environs that resulted in extensive loss of life and property, especially in the Del Gato stream basin. Through an analysis of water quality and the conditions of the habitat on the basis of the macroinvertebrates present as bioindicators of environmental quality, this work aims to contribute to a reevaluation of the role of the marshes adjacent to the stream as flood-alleviation elements, and then propose alternatives for flooding management in the basin. Consequently, quantitative seasonal samples of vegetation, sediments, and benthic organic matter were taken and limnologic parameters measured in three sectors of the basin having different land uses: rural, periurban, and urban-industrial. The macroinvertebrate assemblages, as analyzed through the application of ecological indices, exhibited a marked decline in richness and in the Pampean Biotic Index towards the low-lying basin. Principal-components analysis associated Site 1 with the dissolved-oxygen concentration, Site 2 with high nitrate values, and Site 3 with oxygen demands. Redundancy analysis indicated a positive relationship between Baetidae and Aeolosomatidae with the dissolved-oxygen concentration and between Enchytraeidae and Stratiomyidae with the conductivity. These marshes are fundamental in maintaining good environmental conditions and attenuating the effects of the flooding that is predicted to become increasingly catastrophic in this region as the climate changes.

AB  - Benthic habitats on the Basque continental shelf were mapped based on multibeam echosounder surveys, grab sampling, video surveys and oceanographic monitoring. A total area of 2302 km(2) was classified according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) hierarchical classification. Almost 50% of the area corresponded to rock and other hard substrata and the other 50% corresponded to soft bottoms. The biotic composition of several areas was significantly different from the EUNIS habitat classes described previously; therefore, we propose a total of 13 new classes. The habitat mapping has contributed to improving the knowledge and application of several criteria and indicators used to assess environmental status in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive in-relation to the biological diversity descriptors, such as non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity. It is also useful for other descriptors and for developing the sampling design. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Odonata have been widely used as indicators for the biomonitoring of terrestrial and aquatic habitats due to their sensitivity to environmental impacts. We aimed to determine whether the larval or adult phases of these insects were the best predictors of variation in habitat parameters and the loss of environmental integrity. Specimens were collected during three seasons (dry, rainy, and ebb) from 12 points in the Suia-missu River basin, at the headwaters of the Xingu River in Mato Grosso, Brazil. The Protest analysis indicated a high degree of congruence between the assemblages of larvae and adults in streams with varying degrees of habitat integrity (R = 0.832, p < 0.001, m(2) = 0.307). When the congruence with environmental factors was analyzed, a significant association was found only for the larval phase (R = 0.318, p = 0.03, m(2) = 0.888). When the suborders were analyzed separately, congruence was confirmed for anisopteran adults (R = 0.338, p = 0.031, m(2) = 0.885) and larvae (R = 0.417, p = 0.003, m(2) = 0.826) and for the zygopteran adults (R = 0.345, p = 0.027, m(2) = 0.881) and larvae (R = 0.405, p = 0.011, m(2) = 0.836). These results indicate that both larvae and adults respond systematically to environmental impacts. We suggest that either life phase can be used for biomonitoring, given their effectiveness for the interpretation of disturbance in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. These findings further reinforce the effectiveness of this insect order for the detection of modifications to the environment, showing that they are good indicators of environmental conditions.

AB  - Riparian forests are critically endangered many anthropogenic pressures and natural hazards. The importance of riparian zones has been acknowledged by European Directives, involving multi-scale monitoring. The use of this very-high-resolution and hyperspatial imagery in a multi-temporal approach is an emerging topic. The trend is reinforced by the recent and rapid growth of the use of the unmanned aerial system (UAS), which has prompted the development of innovative methodology. Our study proposes a methodological framework to explore how a set of multi-temporal images acquired during a vegetative period can differentiate some of the deciduous riparian forest species and their health conditions. More specifically, the developed approach intends to identify, through a process of variable selection, which variables derived from UAS imagery and which scale of image analysis are the most relevant to our objectives.
   The methodological framework is applied to two study sites to describe the riparian forest through two fundamental characteristics: the species composition and the health condition. These characteristics were selected not only because of their use as proxies for the riparian zone ecological integrity but also because of their use for river management.
   The comparison of various scales of image analysis identified the smallest object-based image analysis (OBIA) objects (ca. 1 m(2)) as the most relevant scale. Variables derived from spectral information (bands ratios) were identified as the most appropriate, followed by variables related to the vertical structure of the forest. Classification results show good overall accuracies for the species composition of the riparian forest (five classes, 79.5 and 84.1 % for site 1 and site 2). The classification scenario regarding the health condition of the black alders of the site 1 performed the best (90.6 %).
   The quality of the classification models developed with a UAS-based, cost-effective, and semi-automatic approach competes successfully with those developed using more expensive imagery, such as multi-spectral and hyperspectral airborne imagery. The high overall accuracy results obtained by the classification of the diseased alders open the door to applications dedicated to monitoring of the health conditions of riparian forest. Our methodological framework will allow UAS users to manage large imagery metric datasets derived from those dense time series.

AB  - Current scientific research and industry guidelines focus on food safety, aiming to reduce unintentional food contaminations through technological and managerial measures. Due to the deceptive nature of food fraud, the fight to prevent intentional food adulteration and counterfeiting threats requires an approach that goes beyond the common food safety-based strategies and falls into the sphere of food integrity. With food integrity being an emerging discipline, a definition was proposed and the concept of food integrity climate was introduced. A food integrity climate (FIC) self-assessment tool in the form of a questionnaire, with twenty indicators and a five-point Likert rating scale was developed, expert-validated, and tested in practice in a large-scale meat distribution company. The questionnaire was designed to measure the performance level of food integrity in food businesses along the supply chain through managers' and operators' perceptions. Minor but interesting differences were found in the food integrity climate perceived between managers and operators as well as among the company's affiliates. The tool helps food businesses to get a deeper insight on the human dimension behind food integrity through the assessment of five climate components in relation to four food integrity elements, identifying strengths and weaknesses regarding a company's food integrity climate.

AB  - Several recent studies have demonstrated that a functional approach (i.e. analysis of traits indicating species ecological functions) can be successfully used for river biomonitoring. To date this approach has only been applied in temperate rivers, even though it could notably contribute toward the development of an environmental assessment system in developing countries in other climatic zones. Using a multivariate approach (Fuzzy Correspondence Analysis-FCA). we analysed functional invertebrate community characteristics (described by 40 categories of seven biological traits mostly at the family level) at 66 stream sites from neotropical Bolivia with different level of anthropogenic disturbance. We were able to separate the sites on the first FCA axis (F1) (ANOVA test) following the predefined environmental quality classes based on the observed impact. Moreover, the F1 axis scores were significantly related to scores obtained using an independent macroinvertebrate multi-metric index previously developed to assess streams biotic condition in the same biogeographical region. The F1 axis, which thus represents a gradient of anthropogenic impacts, was significantly correlated to 30 of the 40 studied trait categories. Our results (i) clearly confirm the possible use of functional traits for water quality assessment in neotropical streams, and (ii) provides support to the River Habitat Templet hypothesis since habitat disturbances produced predictable functional changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Finally, this study supports the potential worldwide applicability of the species-trait approach as a biomonitoring tool for stream integrity assessment. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In northern Canada, there is increasing concern about the potential negative impacts of industrial activities on wildlife and ecosystems. Therefore, a study was conducted on lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) from Montreal and Reindeer lakes, Saskatchewan, to assess fish health and condition, and ecosystem integrity of these northern lakes. In Montreal Lake, all fish were infected by >= 2 parasite species. The most prevalent parasite at this site was the larval trematode Ichthyocotylurus erraticus, which was detected in all fish examined. All Reindeer Lake whitefish were shown to harbour >= 1 parasite species. The most prevalent parasite (found in 87.9% of fish) at this locality was the larval trematode Diplostomum sp. Macroscopically visible pathogenic changes were not noted. Gross energy values of whitefish were 4.40 +/- 0.88 MJ/kg and 5.14 +/- 1.14 MJ/kg for Montreal Lake and Reindeer Lake, respectively, indicating that fish have sufficient energy stores to withstand stressful conditions. The parasite communities were species-rich and diverse, with Shannon diversity indices of 2.12 (Montreal Lake) and 2.02 (Reindeer Lake). The ratios of allogenic/autogenic as well as planktonic/benthic parasite species did not indicate atypical environmental conditions. Together the findings suggest that in both lakes there is currently no significant anthropogenic impact on the whitefish populations and ecosystem health.

AB  - The impacts of agricultural land uses an surface water quality continue to command attention nationwide In contrast less consideration has been given to understanding aquatic communities in agricultural ecosystems or what measures might be used to indicate how these communities are responding to changing conditions in the surrounding landscape. This review discusses (1) the role of natural processes in agricultural watersheds; (2) the use of biological indicators in aquatic systems; (3) assessments of the effects of agriculturally-derived pollutants both in-stream and at the landscape scale; (4) achievable ecological outcomes; and (5) recommendations far developing ecological indicators and identifying appropriate restoration goals for agricultural systems. If ecological indicators are to be used effectively, it is necessary to identify those taxa and responses that are most closely associated with agricultural stressors. Once such tools are developed an overall framework for designing holistic management plans will help identify realistic and achievable restoration goals that maximize the environmental benefits in a watershed.

AB  - The increasing demand for tools that can score biological condition from aquatic community data has Spurred the creation of many predictive models (e.g., observed/expected [O/E] indices) and multimetric indices (MMIs). The geographic and environmental scopes of these indices vary widely, and coverages often overlap. If indices developed for large environmentally heterogeneous regions provide results equivalent to those developed for smaller regions, then regulatory entities Could adopt indices developed for larger regions rather than fund the development Of multiple indices within a region. We evaluated this potential by comparing the performance (precision, bias, responsiveness, and sensitivity) of benthic macroinvertebrate O/E indices and MMIs developed for California (CA) with that of indices developed for 2 large-scale condition assessments of US streams: the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program Western Pilot Study (EMAP-West) and the western portion of the Wadeable Streams Assessment MSA-West). WSA-West and EMAP-West O/E scores were weakly correlated with CA O/E scores, had lower precision than CA O/E scores, were influenced by 2 related natural gradients M slope and %. fast-water habitat) that did not influence CA O/E scores, and disagreed with 21 to 22% of impairment decisions derived from the CA O/E index. The WSA-West O/E index produced many fewer impairment decisions than did the CA O/E index. WSA-West and EMAP-West MMI scores were strongly correlated with file CA MMI scores. However, the WSA-West and EMAP-West MMIs produced many fewer determinations of impairment than did the CA MMI. EMAP-West and WSA-West MMIs were biased and differed in responsiveness compared with CA MMI. Thus, they might produce estimates of regional condition different from those from indices calibrated to local conditions. The lower precision of the EMAP-West and WSA-West indices compromises their use in site-specific assessments where both precision and accuracy are important. However, the magnitude of differences in impairment decisions was sensitive to the thresholds used to define impaired conditions, so it might be possible to adjust some of the systematic differences among the models to make the large-scale models more suitable for local application. Future work should identify the geographic and environmental scales that optimize index performance, determine the factors that most strongly influence index performance, and identify ways to specify accurate reference condition from geographically extensive reference-site data sets.

AB  - To better evaluate the three-dimensional bay health and predict the dynamic bay health conditions, a concept of numerical bay health was introduced and a method of numerical bay health evaluation (NBHE) was developed. To support the NBHE method, a numerical bay health index (NBHI) system was constructed, which assess the natural and socio-economic effects on the entire bay. Five index groups are combined to formulate the NBHI, including geometry, hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics, bio-ecology, water quality and socio-economy. Each group has different number of indices selected and weighted using AHP method according to their importance. Data were mainly synthesized from a variety of numerical models together with monitoring programs, which provide superior to other approaches in discriminating data integrity and predicting data in future. The NBHE method using NBHI system was applied in the Yueqing Bay during spring tide in April 2007. According to the NBHE results, Sta. A, at the surface level of the estuarine mouth, has a healthy geometry condition, sub-healthy hydrodynamic and sediment dynamic condition, and unhealthy water quality and bioecology conditions. The integrated healthy score at Sta. A indicates its sub-healthy condition.

AB  - Ecosystem integrity often needs to be evaluated rapidly; indicator species may be used to do so. In this study we aim to evaluate whether White Fringed Orchid is an indicator of ombrotrophic peatland (Sphagnum bog) integrity in northeastern North America. The study was carried out in 113 sampling plots located in 60 bogs of southern Quebec, Canada. Vegetation (species cover and strata) and abiotic variables were collected within the plots and disturbance variables were determined using aerial photographs and satellite imagery. The level of integrity on each plot was assessed by calculating a Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI) and an Anthropogenic Activity Index (AAI). Data were analyzed with ANOVAs, multivariate techniques and logistic multiple regression. Results indicated that the presence and abundance of White Fringed Orchid were positively linked to the FQAI and negatively to the perimeter/area ratio variable, suggesting that this species is most abundant and frequent at sites that are less disturbed and influenced by human activities. ANOVA showed that the AAI was lower in plots with high orchid abundance than in those without, suggesting that the orchid grows in more pristine sites. Our study showed that White Fringed Orchid abundance and presence may be used to rapidly and accurately evaluate Sphagnum bog integrity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The utility of aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of the ecological conditions has long been established in rivers and streams. However, useful invertebrate indicators of wetland conditions remain more poorly developed probably because wetland macroinvertebrates have many attributes that reduce their ability to reflect wetland environmental quality. Snails, however, possess several attributes that should make them useful as potential environmental indicators. In this study, we sampled snail assemblages in 16 wetlands across a range of conditions, from relatively pristine "best available" reference sites to obviously human-impacted sites in Northeastern China's Sanjiang Plain. We aimed to investigate the utility of snail taxa for indicating environmental variation across these wetland habitats. Results showed that study wetlands divided into three major groups using multivariate analyses: the five wetlands provided the most protection and having the least impacts grouped as apparent "references", and ten other wetlands in obviously developed areas separated into two other groups of wetlands. Overall snail abundance was higher in the reference wetlands than the impacted wetlands. Seven of the snail species were indicators of specific wetland types. Five pulmonate species including Segmentina nitida, Segmentina hemisphaerula, and Planorbis corneus, Aplexa hypnorum (Physidae), and Galba pervia (Lymnaeidae) were indicators of reference wetlands. Non-pulmonate Bithynia ussuriensis (Bithyniidae) and Valvata sibirica (Valvatidae) were indicators of one of the categories of impacted wetlands. In NE China, snail assemblages and certain indicator species may provide a robust and rapid indicator of environmental impacts on wetlands. Because snails are distributed widely and are generally easy to sample and identify, this overall approach should have applicability in the many wetlands worldwide where diverse snail assemblages naturally occur.

AB  - 1. Traditionally the assessment of river water quality has been based solely on the measurement of physical, chemical and some biological characteristics. While these measurements may be efficient for regulating effluent discharges and protecting humans, they are not very useful for large-scale management of catchments or for assessing whether river ecosystems are being protected.
   2. Measurements of aquatic biota, to identify structural or functional integrity of ecosystems, have recently gained acceptance for river assessment. Empirical evidence from studies of river ecosystems under stress suggests that a small group of biological ecosystem-level indicators can assess river condition. However, physical and chemical features of the environment affect these indicators, the structure and function of which may be changed by human activities.
   3. The term 'river health', applied to the assessment of river condition, is often seen as being analogous with human health, giving many a sense of understanding. Unfortunately, the meaning of 'river health' remains obscure. It is not clear what aspects of river health sets of ecosystem-level indicators actually identify, nor how physical, chemical and biological characteristics may be integrated into measures rather than just observations of cause and effect.
   4. Increased examination of relationships between environmental variables that affect aquatic biota, such as habitat structure, flow regime, energy sources, water quality and biotic interactions and biological condition, are required in the study of river health.

AB  - As global environmental issues and the impact of global environmental changes attract increasing attention from the public and policymakers, the focus has been on developing indicators of ecosystem health at regional to global scales. This broadening of the scale of assessments has led to a heavy reliance on quantitative tools using an array of technological advances (e.g., GIS, remote sensing). The accuracy and quality of reports on ecosystem integrity or health obtained from broad-scale assessments depend to a large extent on understanding the limits of the data and the technologies used. As the public and policymakers increasingly require rapid, timely evaluation of ecosystem conditions, the use of data and technologies that allow real-time, relatively inexpensive, frequent assessments will increase accordingly. Although the limitations of these data and technologies are broadly understood, the practical implications for specific assessments are not always fully considered. Ar broad scales, key measures or indicators of ecosystem integrity are usually related to landscape patterns, such as patch abundance, size, and spatial distribution. Therefore, accurate and robust assessments of ecosystem health require a reliable methodology that captures relevant measures of ecosystem health. It is the purpose of this article to document one aspect of the development of reliable characterization and monitoring protocols, namely the appropriateness of the data used to characterize landscape patterns for assessing ecosystem integrity and ecological conditions. We assessed the use of coarse-resolution advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) derived data for characterizing broad-scale (ecoregions) and fine-scale landscape patterns over the 580,000 km(2) of the interior Columbia River basin. We analyzed patch and landscape indices, correlations, principal components, and a statistical comparison of an AVHRR-derived land-cover map with fine-resolution data. Differences in broad-scale landscape patterns among ecoregions were most successfully characterized using combinations of patch and landscape indices. Both classification levels differentiated ecoregion patterns, but the finest level provided increased discriminating ability. Ecoregion and classification levels interacted to produce results specific to particular cover types. AVHRR-derived data did not adequately characterize some important fine-resolution landscape features. We hypothesized that AVHRR-derived data would be in closest agreement with fine-resolution data when landscape texture was coarse. The results Indicated that landscape texture influenced the performance of AVHRR-derived data, but in an inconsistent manner, suggesting that coarse-resolution differences from fine-resolution data have limited predictability. Our results have important implications for characterizing and discriminating landscape patterns among and within ecoregions and along ecological gradients. Across areas with varying landscape heterogeneity, changes in relationships among ecoregion levels, classification levels, and data resolutions may increase opportunities for inaccurate representation of landscape patterns. The choice of a specific ecoregion level, classification level, and data resolution should be examined for patterns of inconsistent characterization before use in broad-scale ecological assessments.

AB  - A Catalogue of Marine Biodiversity Indicators was developed with the aim of providing the basis for assessing the environmental status of the marine ecosystems. Useful for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), this catalogue allows the navigation of a database of indicators mostly related to biological diversity, non-indigenous species, food webs, and seafloor integrity. Over 600 indicators were compiled, which were developed and used in the framework of different initiatives (e.g., EU policies, research projects) and in national and international contexts (e.g., Regional Seas Conventions, and assessments in non-European seas). The catalogue reflects the current scientific capability to address environmental assessment needs by providing a broad coverage of the most relevant indicators for marine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. The available indicators are reviewed according to their typology, data requirements, development status, geographical coverage, relevance to habitats or biodiversity components, and related human pressures. Through this comprehensive overview, we discuss the potential of the current set of indicators in a wide range of contexts, from large-scale to local environmental programs, and we also address shortcomings in light of current needs. Developed by the DEVOTES Project, the catalogue is freely available through the DEVOTooI software application, which provides browsing and query options for the associated metadata. The tool allows extraction of ranked indicator lists best fulfilling selected criteria, enabling users to search for suitable indicators to address a particular biodiversity component, ecosystem feature, habitat, or pressure in a marine area of interest. This tool is useful for EU Member States, Regional Sea Conventions, the European Commission, non-governmental organizations, managers, scientists, and any person interested in marine environmental assessment. It allows users to build, complement or adjust monitoring programs and has the potential to improve comparability and foster transfer of knowledge across marine regions.

AB  - Sensitive and cost-effective indicators of aquatic ecosystem condition in Amazon streams are necessary to assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on those systems in a viable and ecologically meaningful manner. We conducted the present study in the municipality of Paragominas, state of Para, northern Brazil, where we sampled adult dragonflies in 50 100-m-long wadeable stream sites in 2011. We collected 1769 specimens represented by 11 families, 41 genera and 97 species. The suborder Zygoptera contributed 961 individuals and Anisoptera 808. Among the 97 recorded species, nine were classified as useful indicators of ecological condition, with four species being associated with more degraded streams (three Anisoptera, one Zygoptera) and five with more preserved streams (all were Zygoptera). Anisoptera (dragonflies) tend to provide more useful indicators of more degraded environments because they have more efficient homeostatic mechanisms and are more mobile, enabling them to tolerate a wider range of environmental conditions. By contrast, Zygoptera (damselflies) tend to provide a more useful role as indicators of more preserved environments and high levels of environmental heterogeneity because of their smaller body sizes and home ranges and greater ecophysiological restrictions. We conclude from our assessment of this low-order Amazonian stream system that (i) the occurrence of specific odonate species is strongly associated with the configuration of riparian vegetation, (ii) agricultural activities appear to be the main factor determining changes in the composition of odonate assemblages and (iii) these insects can act as useful indicators of the ecological consequences of riparian habitat loss and disturbance. Because generalist species invade moderately degraded areas, those areas may have high species richness but host few species of Zygoptera. Therefore, preserving dense riparian vegetation is necessary to maintain aquatic ecological condition, and that condition can be rehabilitated by planting new trees. Both require enforcing existing environmental regulations, various types of incentives and educating local communities.

AB  - Despite an increased awareness by governments and the general public of the need for protecting all types of aquatic habitats, human impacts continue to impair the services that these ecosystems provide. Increased monitoring activities that focus on all major biological compartments are needed to quantify the present condition of Earth's aquatic resources and to evaluate the effectiveness of regulations designed to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems. Algae are an ecologically important group in most aquatic ecosystems but are often ignored as indicators of aquatic ecosystem change. We attribute this situation both to an underappreciation of the utility of algal indicators among non-phycologists and to a lack of standardized methods for monitoring with algae.
   Because of their nutritional needs and their position at the base of aquatic foodwebs, algal indicators provide relatively unique information concerning ecosystem condition compared with commonly used animal indicators. Algae respond rapidly and predictably to a wide range of pollutants and, thus, provide potentially useful early warning signals of deteriorating conditions and the possible causes. Algal assemblages provide one of the few benchmarks for establishing historical water quality conditions and for characterizing the minimally impacted biological condition of many disturbed ecosystems. Preliminary comparisons suggest that algal indicators are a cost-effective monitoring tool as well.
   Based on available evidence from field studies, we recommend development of taxonomic indicators based on diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) as a standardized protocol for monitoring ecosystem change. Both population- and community-level indices have inherent strengths, and limitations and information from both levels of biological organization should be utilized in tandem. However, further information concerning species tolerances to a variety of anthropogenic stressors is needed if autecological indices are to be used routinely for monitoring purposes. While functional measures (e.g. productivity) may also prove useful as monitoring tools, further investigation is required to characterize the reliability of alternative methodologies and to assess the consistency of these indicators under varying field conditions.

AB  - Ecologically relevant traits of organisms in an assemblage determine an ecosystem's functional fingerprint (i.e., the shape, size, and position of multidimensional trait space). Quantifying changes in functional fingerprints can therefore provide information about the effects of diversity loss or gain through time on ecosystem condition and is a promising approach to monitoring ecological integrity. This, however, is seldom possible owing to limitations in historical surveys and a lack of data on organismal traits, particularly in diverse tropical regions. Using data from detailed bird surveys from 4 periods across more than a century, and morphological and ecological traits of 233 species, we quantified changes in the avian functional fingerprint of a tropical montane forest in the Andes of Colombia. We found that 78% of the variation in functional space, regardless of period, was described by 3 major axes summarizing body size, dispersal ability (indexed by wing shape), and habitat breadth. Changes in species composition significantly altered the functional fingerprint of the assemblage and functional richness and dispersion decreased 35-60%. Owing to species extirpations and to novel additions to the assemblage, functional space decreased over time, but at least 11% of its volume in the 2010s extended to areas of functional space that were unoccupied in the 1910s. The assemblage now includes fewer large-sized species, more species with greater dispersal ability, and fewer habitat specialists. Extirpated species had high functional uniqueness and distinctiveness, resulting in large reductions in functional richness and dispersion after their loss, which implies important consequences for ecosystem integrity. Conservation efforts aimed at maintaining ecosystem function must move beyond seeking to sustain species numbers to designing complementary strategies for the maintenance of ecological function by identifying and conserving species with traits conferring high vulnerability such as large body size, poor dispersal ability, and greater habitat specialization.
   Article impact statement: Changes in functional fingerprints provide a means to quantify the integrity of ecological assemblages affected by diversity loss or gain.

AB  - The use of predictive models in Neotropical basins is relatively new, and applying these models in large basins is hindered by the lack of ecological, geographical, and social-environmental knowledge. Despite these difficulties, we used data from the das Velhas River basin to apply the BEAST (Benthic Assessment of SedimenT) methodology to evaluate and classify the level of environmental degradation. Our two main objectives were to modify and implement the BEAST methodology for use in biomonitoring programs of Brazilian basins, and to test the hypothesis that a gradient of environmental degradation determines a gradient in the structure and composition of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. We evaluated 37 sites: 8 in the main river, 15 in the main tributaries with different impact levels, and 14 in tributaries with minimally disturbed conditions (MDC). The BEAST model allowed us to classify 16 test sites: two as natural, four as altered, three as highly altered, and seven as degraded. Our results indicated degradation of the das Velhas River basin near its urban areas. The BEAST model indicated that the pollution gradient found among the sites generated a gradient of the macroinvertebrate assemblages, corroborating the hypothesis.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are essential to human societies. However, many anthropogenic activities have been constantly modifying these ecosystems. Such modifications can be detected and measured with the use of environmental bioindicators. This work aims to identify the effect of physical integrity of streams, riparian vegetation coverage and physical and physicochemical variables on fish and Heteroptera faunas of streams, identifying which group is a better indicator of environmental disturbance. Predictor variables were sorted into three matrices: (1) physical and physicochemical parameters of the streams, (2) environmental variables and (3) structural variables of riparian vegetation. We tested the effects of physical and physicochemical descriptors on species richness and abundance through multiple linear regressions. The effects of environmental and structural variables of the riparian vegetation were tested using ridge regressions. Physical and physicochemical variables had no effect on Heteroptera and fish communities. Environmental variables showed effect only on the community of Heteroptera. Ichthyic assemblages were not influenced by any environmental variables. Selected structural variables had no relation with the Heteroptera assemblages, neither with fish community. Therefore, we conclude that, in small Amazonian streams, Heteroptera is more sensitive to human impacts than fish. This sensibility is demonstrated by the negative relation between Heteroptera fauna and the canopy opening over the river and positively related to environment integrity. These associations were not found for icthyofauna.

AB  - South Africa's moist grassland harbours globally significant biodiversity, supplies essential ecosystem services, supports crop and livestock agriculture, forestry and settlement, yet is poorly conserved. Ongoing transformation and limited opportunity for expanding the protected area network require instead that biodiversity conservation is 'mainstreamed' within other land uses. This exercise sought to identify the relative compatibility of 10 land uses (conservation, livestock or game ranching, tourism/recreation, rural settlement, dryland cropping, irrigated cropping, dairy farming, plantation forestry, and urban settlement) with maintaining biodiversity integrity. This was assessed using 46 indicators for biodiversity integrity that covered landscape composition, structure, and functioning. Data was integrated into a single measure per land use through application of the analytic hierarchy process, with supporting information gained from interviews with experts. The rank order of importance amongst indicators was landscape structure. functioning and composition. Consistent differences among land use, for all three categories revealed two clear groupings. Conservation, livestock or game ranching had the lowest impact and retained substantial natural asset. while that for tourism/recreation was intermediate. All other land uses had a severe impact. Impact on biodiversity integrity depended mainly on the extent of transformation and fragmentation, which accounted for the greatest impact on habitats and species, and impairment of landscape functioning. It is suggested that a strategic intervention for maintaining biodiversity integrity of moist grassland is to support livestock or game ranching and limit ongoing urban sprawl. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem based management, policy development, and regulatory applications.

AB  - The importance of flow regime variability for maintaining ecological functioning and integrity of river ecosystems has been firmly established in both natural and anthropogenically modified systems. River flow regimes across lowland catchments in eastern England are examined using 47 variables, including those derived using the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) software. A principal component analysis method was used to identify redundant hydrological variables and those that best characterized the hydrological series (1986-2005). A small number of variables (<6) characterized up to 95% of the statistical variability in the flow series. The hydrological processes and conditions that the variables represent were found to be significant in structuring the in-stream macroinvertebrate community Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE) scores at both the family and species levels. However, hydrological variables only account for a relatively small proportion of the total ecological variability (typically <10%). The research indicates that a range of other factors, including channel morphology and anthropogenic modification of in-stream habitats, structure riverine macroinvertebrate communities in addition to hydrology. These factors need to be considered in future environmental flow studies to enable the characterization of baseline/reference conditions for management and restoration purposes.

AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are currently under threat, particularly in developing countries. In Mexico, intensive land use and inadequate monitoring policies have resulted in the severe degradation of the country's freshwater ecosystems. This study assesses how the macroinvertebrate communities in the Pesqueria River, located in Northeastern Mexico, are affected by riparian land use, in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators to evaluate the macroinvertebrate integrity of the Pesqueria River. First, we characterized the land use cover in the riparian channel. Second, we sampled 16 sites for benthic macroinvertebrates along the main channel during the wet and dry seasons. Third, we evaluated the influence of the riparian channel land use on the macroinvertebrate community using 42 different biological metrics. The land use characterization depicted a riparian channel mainly influenced by agricultural and urban land use. Eighty-one invertebrate taxa were identified during the study. Permutational analysis of the variance analysis confirmed significant differences across the different land use classes and the macroinvertebrate community composition while no differences were found between seasons. The indicator species analysis revealed 31 representative taxa for natural land use, 1 for urban, and 4 for agricultural land use. Our modelling analysis showed that 28 of the 42 biological metrics tested responded significantly to land use disturbances, confirming the impact of land use changes on the Pesqueria River's macroinvertebrate communities and suggesting that these metrics may have a use as bioindicators. Finally, this study may provide significant biological information for further studies in similar conditions.

AB  - Bornova metropolitan district is one of the most urbanised districts in Izmir metropolitan city, Turkey; with unknown eff ;ects on the potential ecosystem services along urban-rural areas. This study mapped the condition of ecosystem services' potential and analysed their spatiotemporal dynamics and patterns between 1990 and 2018 for Bornova district. The methodology used in this study was based on an existing potential ecosystem services mapping methodology and spatially explicit index using open access available spatial data. The spatiotemporal changes in the potential ecosystem services along the urban-rural gradient of Bornova district were assessed by global climate regulation (carbon storage), microclimate mitigation (Land Surface Temperature) and ecological integrity. The total vegetation cover in Bornova district increased from 18.41 % to 27.95 % to the last 28 years, particularly in peri-urban areas. Accordingly, two of the selected ecosystem services' potential has increased throughout the district, except for ecological integrity. These changes were closely related to the deliberate efforts of the Bornova Municipal Council in increasing the amount of urban green and open spaces throughout the Bornova district in coordination with Izmir Metropolitan City Council's commitment to build a healthy and climate friendly city in the near future.

AB  - We developed a system for the assessment of ecological condition for rivers in the lower mountains and lowlands of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region (Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh). We used benthic invertebrates collected from 198 rivers, located in five different ecoregions and covering degradation gradients; samples were taken twice (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon) applying a multi-habitat sampling procedure. Out of 38 environmental parameters, we constructed complex principal component analysis (PCA) gradients, separately for the stressors organic pollution, eutrophication, floodplain land use, and hydromorphological degradation. Correlation analysis between invertebrate metrics and environmental parameters revealed those biological metrics that are most responsive to river deterioration. Redundant metrics were deleted, and the most robust metrics were selected. The range of the index values under reference conditions was defined, and a five-class river quality system was generated.

AB  - Timber harvest is a prevailing economic activity in Amazonia, which contributes to forest degradation and biodiversity loss. However, Reduced-impact logging has been used to mitigate the loss of environmental integrity and biodiversity, since it has been assumed to be less detrimental than conventional logging practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate if environmental conditions, streams and Odonata communities in reduced-impact logging areas (RIL) are similar to those of unlogged areas (CONTROL), whilst all are modified in conventional logging areas (CL), as a consequence of vegetation removal from the margins of water bodies. Forty-nine streams in areas that differ in timber harvest practices were sampled in eastern Amazonia. As expected, aquatic systems in RIL areas showed environmental conditions and Odonata species composition similar to CONTROL areas while CL streams differed both from CONTROL and RIL. Odonata richness and abundance were not different between CONTROL, RIL and CL treatments, however. Despite the fact that species richness and abundance changes may be masked by the presence of remaining riparian vegetation in CL areas, the use of reduced-impact logging minimizes changes in Odonata species composition and environmental conditions, that remain similar to that of unlogged areas. This is possible due to the planning to reduce environmental impacts in RIL. Unlike RIL, most canopy cover in the proximity of the water bodies (<10 m distance) is lost in CL areas due to logging activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier S.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regional assessment of cumulative impacts of dams on riverine fish assemblages provides resource managers essential information for dam operation, potential dam removal, river health assessment and overall ecosystem management. Such an assessment is challenging because characteristics of fish assemblages are not only affected by dams, but also influenced by natural variation and human-induced modification (in addition to dams) in thermal and flow regimes, physicochemical habitats and biological assemblages. This study evaluated the impacts of dams on river fish assemblages in the non-impoundment sections of rivers in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin using multiple fish assemblage indicators and multiple approaches to distinguish the influences of dams from those of other natural and human-induced factors. We found that environmental factors that influence fish assemblages in addition to dams should be incorporated when evaluating regional effects of dams on fish assemblages. Without considering such co-influential factors, the evaluation is inadequate and potentially misleading. The role of dams alone in determining fish assemblages at a regional spatial scale is relatively small (explained less than 20% of variance) compared with the other environmental factors, such as river size, flow and thermal regimes and land uses jointly. However, our results do demonstrate that downstream and upstream dams can substantially modify fish assemblages in the non-impoundment sections of rivers. After excluding river size and land-use influences, our results clearly demonstrate that dams have significant impacts on fish biotic-integrity and habitat-and-social-preference indicators. The influences of the upstream dams, downstream dams, distance to dams, and dam density differ among the fish indicators, which have different implications for maintaining river biotic integrity, protecting biodiversity and managing fisheries.

AB  - We developed and evaluated empirical models to predict biological condition of wadeable streams in a large portion of the eastern USA, with the ultimate goal of prediction for unsampled basins. Previous work had classified (i.e., altered vs. unaltered) the biological condition of 920 streams based on a biological assessment of macroinvertebrate assemblages. Predictor variables were limited to widely available geospatial data, which included land cover, topography, climate, soils, societal infrastructure, and potential hydrologic modification. We compared the accuracy of predictions of biological condition class based on models with continuous and binary responses. We also evaluated the relative importance of specific groups and individual predictor variables, as well as the relationships between the most important predictors and biological condition. Prediction accuracy and the relative importance of predictor variables were different for two subregions for which models were created. Predictive accuracy in the highlands region improved by including predictors that represented both natural and human activities. Riparian land cover and road-stream intersections were the most important predictors. In contrast, predictive accuracy in the lowlands region was best for models limited to predictors representing natural factors, including basin topography and soil properties. Partial dependence plots revealed complex and nonlinear relationships between specific predictors and the probability of biological alteration. We demonstrate a potential application of the model by predicting biological condition in 552 unsampled basins across an ecoregion in southeastern Wisconsin (USA). Estimates of the likelihood of biological condition of unsampled streams could be a valuable tool for screening large numbers of basins to focus targeted monitoring of potentially unaltered or altered stream segments.

AB  - Stream management goals for biological integrity may be difficult to achieve in developed landscapes where channel modification and other factors constrain in-stream conditions. To evaluate potential constraints on biological integrity, we developed a statewide landscape model for California that estimates ranges of likely scores for a macroinvertebrate-based index that are typical at a site with the observed level of landscape alteration. This context can support prioritization decisions for stream management, like identifying reaches for restoration or enhanced protection based on how observed scores relate to model predictions. Median scores were accurately predicted by the model for all sites in California with bioassessment data (Pearson correlation r = 0.75 between observed and predicted for calibration data, r = 0.72 for validation). The model also predicted that 15% of streams statewide are constrained for biological integrity within their present developed landscape, particularly for urban and agricultural areas in the South Coast, Central Valley, and Bay Area regions. We worked with a local stakeholder group from the San Gabriel River watershed (Los Angeles County, California) to evaluate how the statewide model could support local management decisions. To achieve this purpose, we created an interactive application, the Stream Classification and Priority Explorer, that compares observed scores with predictions from the landscape model to assign priorities. We observed model predictions consistent with the land-use gradient from the upper to lower watershed, where potential limits to achieving biological integrity were more common in the heavily-urbanized lower watershed. However, most of the sites in the lower watershed scored within their predicted ranges, and were therefore given a low priority for restoration. In contrast, 2 low-scoring sites in the undeveloped upper watershed were prioritized for causal assessment and possible future restoration, whereas 3 high-scoring sites were prioritized for protection. The availability of geospatial and bioassessment data at the national level suggests that these tools can easily be applied to inform management decisions at other locations where altered landscapes may limit biological integrity.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration planning requires quantitative rigor to evaluate alternatives, define end states, report progress and perform environmental benefits analysis (EBA). Unfortunately, existing planning frameworks are, at best, semi-quantitative. In this paper, we: (1) describe a quantitative restoration planning approach based on a comprehensive, but simple mathematical framework that can be used to effectively apply knowledge and evaluate alternatives, (2) use the approach to derive a simple but precisely defined lexicon based on the reference condition concept and allied terms and (3) illustrate the approach with an example from the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) using hydrologic indicators. The approach supports the development of a scaleable restoration strategy that, in theory, can be expanded to ecosystem characteristics such as hydraulics, geomorphology, habitat and biodiversity. We identify three reference condition types, best achievable condition (A(BAC)), measured magnitude (MMi which can be determined at one or many times and places) and desired future condition (A(DFC)) that, when used with the mathematical framework, provide a complete system of accounts useful for goal-oriented system-level management and restoration.

AB  - Ecosystem-level processes are increasingly used by researchers and managers as indicators of ecological integrity for bioassessment, particularly in streams. However, processes like litter breakdown integrate multiple mechanistic pathways, which can vary differentially even under natural, unimpacted conditions. In particular, weather-driven hydrologic variations may strongly influence invertebrate shredder feeding and physical abrasion, inducing high natural variability of litter breakdown rates, which may obscure the effects of anthropogenic disturbances. Yet, such variability is rarely assessed to refine benchmarks of ecological status. Here, we quantified how interannual hydrologic differences contributed to the spatio-temporal variability of litter breakdown rate and its components (fragmentation, lambda(F); and dissolution and microbial decomposition, lambda(m)), in low-order unimpacted, perennial streams across three climatically similar regions in temperate Canada. We measured litter breakdown rates in coarse (5 or 10mm; k(c))- and fine-mesh (0.5mm; k(f)) leaf bags during fall for 2-4 yr and used variance partitioning to disentangle the variation of k(c), lambda(F), and lambda(m), as explained by hydrologic indices (during and prior to leaf bag incubation), decomposer-related variables, and water chemistry. Contrary to our hypotheses, interannual hydrologic variability was unrelated to lambda(F), and poorly predicted lambda(m) and k(c) within regions. Within-region spatial (i.e., across sites in a year) and temporal (across years at a site) differences in k(c) approximated or exceeded the range of natural variability suggested to characterize reference conditions by a popular bioassessment framework. Accordingly, we recommend site- and region-specific modifications of benchmarks for reference conditions that account for interannual variability, while cautioning about their potential non-stationarity under climate change. Composite parameters such as k(c)/k(f) and lambda(F)/lambda(m) were substantially more variable across sites, and hence are not robust assessment parameters. As the range of natural variability of litter breakdown revealed in this study can overlap with the average impacts of certain anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., nutrient enrichment) on this parameter reported by previous research, we emphasize the need to include other structural and functional indicators to ensure comprehensive stream bioassessments.

AB  - 1. Wetlands are ecologically and economically important ecosystems but are threatened globally by many forms of human disturbance. Understanding the responses of wetland species to human disturbance is essential for effective wetland management and conservation. 2. We undertook a study to determine (i) whether anurans can be used effectively to assess the ecological integrity of wetlands affected by groundwater withdrawal and, if so, (ii) what effect increasing urbanization might have on the utility of anurans as wetland indicators. We monitored the intensity of anuran calls at 42 wetlands in south-western Florida throughout 20012002 and 20052009. 3. We first validated the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity using a small group of wetlands by comparing anuran calling and subsequent tadpole development with an established index employing vegetation composition and structure. We then verified that the results could be expanded to a variety of sites throughout the region. Finally, we focused on urbanized wetlands to determine whether urbanization could interfere with the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity. 4. We used PRESENCE to estimate occupancy and detection probabilities and to examine the relationship between occupancy and five covariates expected to influence individual species occurrence. We used FRAGSTATS to calculate the mean proximity index for urbanized wetlands, which assesses the size and distribution of land use types within a specified area. 5. Our results showed that the group of species including oak toad Anaxyrus quercicus, southern cricket frog Acris gryllus, pinewoods treefrog Hyla femoralis, barking treefrog Hyla gratiosa, and little grass frog Pseudacris ocularis is a reliable indicator of wetland integrity. However, this same group of species, which is sensitive to wetland health, is selectively excluded from urbanized wetlands. 6. Synthesis and applications. Although anurans are effective indicators of wetland health and complement vegetation surveys, the usefulness of this group for monitoring the ecological integrity of wetlands can be substantially reduced, or eliminated, as a consequence of urbanization. We urge for careful consideration of confounding factors in any studies examining the utility of indicator species.

AB  - The science and practice of assessing the status and trends of ecological conditions in great rivers have not kept pace with perturbation wrought on these systems. Participants at a symposium sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the Council of State Governments concluded that useful and efficient assessments of great river ecosystems require thoughtful alignment of sampling designs, spatial and temporal scales, indicators, management needs, and ecosystem characteristics. Site-specific physical, chemical, and biological data long accumulated by monitoring programs have value but fail to provide the integrated system-wide perspective required for adaptive management and the Clean Water Act. Use of existing data may be limited by methodological incompatibilities, access difficulties, and the exclusive applicability of data to specific habitats or sites. The transition from site-specific to system-wide assessments benefits from research being done by USEPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) and other programs that use probability surveys and biological indicators. Indicators of various taxa (in particular fish, algae, and benthic invertebrates) have been successfully developed for great rivers. However, optimizing the information these ecological indicators convey to managers and the public is the subject of ongoing research.

AB  - Maintained structural integrity of hippocampal and cortical gray matter may explain why some older adults show rather preserved episodic memory. However, viable measurement models for estimating individual differences in gray matter structural integrity are lacking; instead, findings rely on fallible single indicators of integrity. Here, we introduce multitrait-multimethod methodology to capture individual differences in gray matter integrity, based on multimodal structural imaging in a large sample of 1522 healthy adults aged 60-88 years from the Berlin Aging Study II, including 333 participants who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Structural integrity factors expressed the common variance of voxel-based morphometry, mean diffusivity, and magnetization transfer ratio for each of four regions of interest: hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. Except for precuneus, the integrity factors correlated with episodic memory. Associations with hippocampal and parahippocampal integrity persisted after controlling for age, sex, and education. Our results support the proposition that episodic memory ability in old age benefits from maintained structural integrity of hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Exploratory follow-up analyses on sex differences showed that this effect is restricted to men. Multimodal factors of structural brain integrity might help to improve our biological understanding of human memory aging.

AB  - Given that different types of landscape are affected by different environmental factors, is it possible to identify plant species indicative of these landscape types? An analysis of indicator species was made using 140 vegetation samples distributed over five landscape types. A total of 30 indicator species were identified, displaying varying indicator value. The variation disclosed the existence of a gradient between landscape types in terms of the prevailing ecological conditions. The analysis of the results also led to a reflection on the hierarchical level of which species are indicative (landscape vs. ecosystem). Further 20 samples were taken to check the validity of the indicator species. The identification of the indicator species present in these samples enabled each sample to be assigned to one of the landscape types; that assignment was subsequently checked against the actual landscape from which samples were taken. Seventy-five percent of the 20 validation samples were correctly assigned; the misassignment of the remaining 25% was due largely to the heterogeneous nature of the landscapes. On the basis of these results, we concluded that it is possible to characterize landscapes on the basis of indicative plant species, although characterization becomes more incomplete as the internally heterogeneous nature of the landscape increases.

AB  - The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 includes the nations broadest statutory commitment to ecosystem protection: to '' ensure that the biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health of the system are maintained.'' The act also directs the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to expand the scope of conservation monitoring, assessment, and management beyond refuge boundaries to encompass surrounding landscapes. The act thus gives the FWS a leadership role in developing research and management partnerships with other agencies, organizations, and neighboring landowners. Increasing research capacity and scientific expertise, and strengthening institutional resolve to limit activities that impede the attainment of this directive, are challenges for the FWS. Success requires reexamination of existing priorities, refocused training, the acquisition of new funding and technical expertise, and creative application of those new skills to meet the laws broad mandate.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine whether metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) damage bacterial cell membranes. Bacterial cell membrane integrity was determined after 1 h exposure to titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs (0, 10, 50, 100, and 500 mg/L) in ultrapure water and in the presence of natural organic matter. Samples were stained with propidium iodide and counterstained with a nonspecific DNA stain for cell membrane integrity assessment using fluorescence microscopy. Results revealed a measurable impact on the cell membrane integrity of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria at 100 and 500mg/L TiO2 even in the presence of natural organic matter (2mg/L dissolved organic carbon). On the other hand, no statistically significant (p = 0.05) change in cell membrane integrity was observed with ZnO that aggregated and precipitated at concentrations at or above 100mg/L. In addition, Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecium) were not impacted in the presence of ZnO or TiO2. Transmission electron microscopy images show an interaction between TiO2 NPs and E. coli cells. This interaction was not observed for ZnO NPs or Gram-positive cells. The cell membrane integrity assay indicated NP impact on bacterial cells that were not detected by plating techniques. Cell membrane integrity assays show promise for broader application in environmental matrices where traditional growth-based approaches are limited because of their bias toward easily cultured organisms.

AB  - In Lake Superior's Pukaskwa National Park (PNP) in northern Ontario, Canada, herring gull (Larus argentatus) population size is used as an indicator of ecological integrity. Since the 1970s, gull populations have declined by 70% suggesting deteriorating park conditions. However, most other rated park indicators show stable or positive trends. Here, we focus on reconciling these seemingly disparate trends through a better understanding of factors regulating PNP gull populations. Lake-wide declines in surface-schooling prey fish may be limiting aquatic food resources for PNP gulls. To investigate this, we examined gull population trends in different parts of the park in the context of food availability. Gull diets were assessed using regurgitated pellets, egg stable isotopes (nitrogen, carbon) and fatty acids. Population declines were more severe in southern PNP compared to northern PNP and inter-region differences in bird diets likely contributed to these population trends. Gulls in the south relied to a greater extent on dwindling aquatic food resources, i.e., prey fish, while birds in northern PNP supplemented their diets with anthropogenic foods, i.e., garbage. Recognizing that regional declines in aquatic food availability have occurred across eastern Lake Superior is important for the interpretation of PNP gull population trends. Wide-scale ecological changes affecting PNP suggest that factors limiting PNP's herring gull population are not park-specific but, instead, reflect broader ecosystem-wide changes. Defining an appropriate threshold based on current knowledge of ecological conditions on Lake Superior is critical for using herring gull populations as an indicator of park ecological integrity.

AB  - There is a growing need to identify efficient biological indicators for assessing accelerated land use intensification, as well for understanding the effects of past environmental changes on species distributions. To address this, we used an extensive opportunistic survey dataset of 254 adult odonate (suborder Anisoptera or dragonflies; suborder Zygoptera or damselflies) species collected in nine Mexican hydrological regions during two time windows (1980-1993 and 1994-2010). We evaluated species richness, body size and individual species' response to land use intensification over time at a national scale using Phylogenetic Bayesian Regression Mixed Models. We found that dragonfly species serve as good indicators of current land use, whereas damselfly species show time-lagged effects of land use intensification. Large species could thus be used as a proxy of recent reduction of original vegetation, whereas small species provide information on historic habitat modification. Odonate body size seems to be a better variable for measuring the integrity of original vegetation than the more commonly used species richness. Finally, the use of individual species as bioindicators at broad spatial and temporal scales is not encouraged, as it does not reflect the degree of ecological integrity, and only the occurrence of some species combinations can indicate environmental degradation.

AB  - Tools for assessing and communicating salt marsh condition are essential to guide decisions aimed at maintaining or restoring ecosystem integrity and services. Multimetric indices (MMIs) are increasingly used to provide integrated assessments of ecosystem condition. We employed a theory-based approach that considers the multivariate relationship of metrics with human disturbance to construct a salt marsh MMI for five National Parks in the northeastern USA. We quantified the degree of human disturbance for each marsh using the first principal component score from a principal components analysis of physical, chemical, and land use stressors. We then applied a metric selection algorithm to different combinations of about 45 vegetation and nekton metrics (e.g., species abundance, species richness, and ecological and functional classifications) derived from multi-year monitoring data. While MMIs derived from nekton or vegetation metrics alone were strongly correlated with human disturbance (r values from -0.80 to -0.93), an MMI derived from both vegetation and nekton metrics yielded an exceptionally strong correlation with disturbance (r = -0.96). Individual MMIs included from one to five metrics. The metric-assembly algorithm yielded parsimonious MMIs that exhibit the greatest possible correlations with disturbance in a way that is objective, efficient, and reproducible.

AB  - Estuaries and lagoons are especially affected by anthropogenic pressures. This has resulted in symptoms of degradation including water quality impairment and loss of aquatic biota. Protection of aquatic biodiversity and management of these coastal systems require robust tools to assess habitat integrity. Fish populations have been extensively used to define habitat integrity in freshwater systems. Comparatively much less has been achieved in estuarine, lagoonal and related coastal systems classified as transitional systems under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The implementation of the WFD has prompted the rapid development of estuarine fish indices across Europe. In this context, this paper reviews seventeen published fish-based indices applied to estuarine systems worldwide and summarises common development strategies. Most indices are computed from a number of independent metrics and are based on assemblage composition or functional attributes of fish species (guilds). Among metric groups, species richness-composition metrics are the most widely used in current indices, followed by habitat guild, trophic guild, abundance and condition, and finally nursery function metrics. Within these, indicator species or guilds associated with estuarine quality features often dominate the indices. Development strategies vary but generally include (1) selection and calibration of metrics to anthropogenic pressure; (2) development of reference conditions; (3) comparison of metric values to reference ones; and (4) designation of thresholds for ecological status class. All index developers invest a large amount of effort on the definition and formulation of the reference values. Comparatively less effort is invested in the evaluation of the relevance and precision of the assessment. Only about half of the indices reviewed attempt any validation of the index outcomes and these are limited to simple correlation analysis and misclassification rate analysis by comparing index value with anthropogenic pressure proxies. Currently there are no European-wide consistent fish indices for transitional waters. Widening of the geographical relevance will require better precision in the formulation of reference conditions and greater inclusion of functional attributes in the indices. More recent transitional fish indices have paid increased attention to sampling method and effort, as well as metric sensitivity and robustness. This trend has continued parallel to the implementation of WFD-monitoring programmes across Europe. Further improvements are still needed to link pressures with index response and the characterisation of uncertainty levels in the index outcomes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in land-use practices have affected the integrity and quality of water resources worldwide. In Patagonia there is a strong concern about the ecological status of surface waters because these changes are rapidly occurring in the region. To test the hypothesis that greater intensity of land-use will have negative effects on water quality, stream habitat and biodiversity we assessed benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian/littoral invertebrates, fish and birds from the riparian corridor and environmental variables of 15 rivers (Patagonia) subjected to a gradient of land-use practices (non-managed native forest, managed native forest, pine plantations, pasture, urbanization). A total of 158 macroinvertebrate taxa, 105 riparian/littoral invertebrate taxa, 5 fish species, 34 bird species, and 15 aquatic plant species, were recorded considering all sites. Urban land-use produced the most significant changes in streams including physical features, conductivity, nutrients, habitat condition, riparian quality and invertebrate metrics. Pasture and managed native forest sites appeared in an intermediate situation. The highest values of fish and bird abundance and diversity were observed at disturbed sites; this might be explained by the opportunistic behavior displayed by these communities which let them take advantage of increased trophic resources in these environments. As expected, non-managed native forest sites showed the highest integrity of ecological conditions and also great biodiversity of benthic communities. Macroinvertebrate metrics that reflected good water quality were positively related to forest land cover and negatively related to urban and pasture land cover. However, by offering stream edge areas, pasture sites still supported rich communities of riparian/littoral invertebrates, increasing overall biodiversity. Macroinvertebrates were good indicators of land-use impact and water quality conditions and resulted useful tools to early alert of disturbances in streams. Fish and birds having a greater ability of dispersion and capacity to move quickly from disturbances would reflect changes at a higher scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - High-profile reports of detrimental scientific practices leading to retractions in the scientific literature contribute to lack of trust in scientific experts. Although the bulk of these have been in the literature of other disciplines, environmental toxicology and chemistry are not free from problems. While we believe that egregious misconduct such as fraud, fabrication of data, or plagiarism is rare, scientific integrity is much broader than the absence of misconduct. We are more concerned with more commonly encountered and nuanced issues such as poor reliability and bias. We review a range of topics including conflicts of interests, competing interests, some particularly challenging situations, reproducibility, bias, and other attributes of ecotoxicological studies that enhance or detract from scientific credibility. Our vision of scientific integrity encourages a self-correcting culture that promotes scientific rigor, relevant reproducible research, transparency in competing interests, methods and results, and education.

AB  - Efficient community indices and indicators are crucial for the adequate management and design of measures ensuring the ecosystem integrity. In this study we analyse the shape, sign and strength of the response of some biotic integrity indices and indicators of structure and function of fish communities along geo-climatic and human pressures gradients at catchment scale. To that purpose,>300 sites all over the Iberian Peninsula were characterized at the catchment scale by means of two anthropogenic drivers (agricultural and urban land proportion) and seven natural environmental descriptors covering geographical and climatic aspects. Regarding to fish-based metrics, a set of the most frequently used in stream health assessment studies have been selected, including taxonomic classic indicators, size related indicators and also recent multimetric indices created in the European context (WFD). We applied boosted regression trees that allow estimating the sign and strength of the response as well as considering non-linearity and impact thresholds. Our results show that the jointly contribution of anthropic drivers was lower than geo-climatic drivers. For most of indices and indicators, one single land cover contributed more markedly to the total deviance explained than the other, and they responded rather consistently to land-use variables, i.e., most of them responded negatively to the increase of anthropic use in the catchment. Size diversity, Fish Region Index (FRI) and maximum weight were those more sensible to agriculture land, while EFI+, mean weight, distinctness and FRI were those more sensitive to urban land. Regarding the shape of the response, urban land proportion affects normally at extremely low values, while agriculture land proportion induces smoother changes on a wider range. Our results may have practical implications, such as the selection of an efficient array of fish-based metrics to be included in ecological assessment and monitoring programs.

AB  - The technique of randomamplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) permits the study of genetic ecotoxicology without having to face the problem posed by the high number of chromosomes generally presented by the fish species used in traditional methods. Additionally, the use of in vitro systems allows the study of a large number of samples in environmental-risk assessment.
   Good standardization of the parameters involved in the RAPD reaction, such as primer concentration and the DNA template used and its integrity, is fundamental for obtaining reliable and repeatable results. This is especially important when the differences in DNA fingerprints between control cells and cells exposed to genotoxic agents are interpreted as toxic-dependent alterations. The use of more than one primer increases sensitivity in the detection of such differences, provided the amplification is carried out under optimum conditions. This article demonstrates that the conditions established for certain primers in previous studies can be acceptable for others, independent of the complexity of band patterns generated.
   Furthermore, the integrity of the DNA is shown to be stable for several months in the genomic extracts stored at 4degrees C, which to a large extent facilitates the application of this methodology.

AB  - An assessment system suitable to support implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive's local water management plans should build on quantitative knowledge about a suite of well-documented indicator and umbrella species' requirements for different stream orders. Assuring high communication value for improving local public awareness and participation for restoring ecological integrity in impaired headwater streams is critical. Loss and fragmentation of forests are major threats to ecological integrity. The aquatic macroinvertebrate order Plecoptera is commonly used as an indicator of the ecological integrity of streams. We measured abundance and taxonomic richness of Plecoptera in relation to land cover and water chemistry in second and third order catchments' in 25 headwater streams in Central Europe's Carpathian Mountains. Plecoptera abundance and Plecoptera taxa richness were positively correlated to each other, as well as to forest proportion in the catchments, but negatively correlated to catchment area, inorganic carbon, alkalinity and conductivity. Segmented linear regression was then used to identify thresholds associated to forest proportion as a surrogate for catchment integrity. No threshold was found for Plecoptera abundance, but for taxa richness a threshold of 54% forest cover was found, below which Plecoptera was affected in second order streams. Using Plecoptera as a proxy for ecological integrity this study indicates that forest cover is an effective bioindicator in headwater catchments for predicting the ecological status of headwater streams. The non-linear relationship between forest cover and Plecoptera can be used as a science-based norm whereby land cover monitoring can be used to assess the ecological status of streams.

AB  - Many indicators and indices have been previously developed to report biodiversity condition at a regional scale. However, none have specifically focused on vegetation condition as a surrogate for biodiversity, and also incorporated threats at multiple scales. Using five indicators (forest cover fragmentation, urbanisation, weeds, feral animals and road density) identified from the scientific literature and selected in collaboration with natural resource management (NRM) stakeholders to reflect the state of vegetation condition in the World Heritage-listed Wet Tropics Bioregion of Queensland, Australia, we constructed a simple composite threat index which allowed the spatial display of information at the regional and subregional scale. Using this approach we identified that the overall vegetation condition of the Wet Tropics in the period 2003-2007 was 'good', but at a finer scale five of the bioregions nine subregions had 'moderate' condition, and only four had 'good' condition. The primary threat contributing to the 'moderate' condition was vegetation fragmentation due to clearing for agriculture, housing and related transport infrastructure. The composite threat index approach provided managers with a report card for the Wet Tropics landscape which allows rapid assessment of vegetation condition and contributory threats, and thus prioritization for the allocation of limited resources to threatening processes at the subregional scale.

AB  - This study attempts to develop Floristic Quality Index (FQI) as a biological indicator of human influence to evaluate ecological conditions of the River Soan and its feeding tributaries and establish the link between spatial distribution of plant communities to natural and anthropogenic gradients using classification and ordination methods. Plant species abundance data, water quality parameters, physical habitat, land-use types and climatic parameters were collected from 63 sites. Cluster Analysis (CA) identified five spatial groups of sites based on the floristic composition. Correspondence Analysis revealed the impact of urbanization, habitat degradation, and water quality as environmental predictors of anthropogenic stress. Floristic Quality Index (FQI) showed negative correlation with parameter associated with anthropogenic activities. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) axes were strongly related with FQI scores (r=>0.9) and showed sites with least impact from man-made activities had higher FQI values. FQI values were lower for sites surrounded by agricultural or urban land-use types, with hydrologic modification and habitat deterioration. The results can provide a means of using an integrated approach of FQI, vegetation classification and ordination methods to evaluate riparian conditions, suggest continuous monitoring framework for biological indicators over time and assist to evaluate future conservation efforts.

AB  - Efficient cooling and lubrication techniques are required to obtain sustainable machining of difficult-to-cut materials, which are the pillars of aerospace, automotive, medical and nuclear industries. Excessive cutting fluid is required and consumed in machining difficult-to-machine materials with high-pressure coolant supplies. Nanofluid-assisted minimum quantity lubrication (NFMQL) is adorned with improved machining performance and environmental sustainability. The present work addresses the surface integrity and chip morphology in finish hard turning of AISI D3 steel under NFMQL condition. The surface integrity aspects include microhardness, residual stress, white layer formation, machined surface morphology, and surface roughness. This experimental investigation aims to explore the feasibility of low-cost multilayer (TiCN/Al2O3/TiN) coated carbide tool in hard machining applications and to assess the propitious role of minimum quantity lubrication using graphene nanoparticles with enriched radiator coolant-based nano-cutting fluid for machinability improvement in hardened steel. Combined approach of central composite design-analysis of variance, desirability function analysis, and response surface methodology, has been subsequently employed for experimental investigation, predictive modelling, and optimization of surface roughness. With a motivational philosophy of "Go Green-Think Green-Act Green", the work also deals with economic analysis and sustainability assessment under environmental-friendly NFMQL condition. It is expected that the found optimized parameters can contribute to machining end-outcomes such as an improved surface finish and reduced machining cost. The results showed that machining with NFMQL provided an effective cooling-lubrication strategy, safer and cleaner production, environmental friendliness and assisted in improving sustainability. In conclusion, the proposed NFMQL turning strategy is a robust method validated by statistical analysis for large industrial applications, especially in mould and die making sectors.

AB  - River monitoring and assessment programs are important tools to quantify the condition of river ecosystems, identify deficits, and provide preliminary indication of how to improve them. But, they are limited in delivering comparable assessment results across national or transnational borders, aggregating site-specific assessments into broader scale assessments, and supporting river management decisions. We present a multi-criteria decision analysis approach for improving the comparability of ecological assessment methods of different origin and for combining these assessments into a joint procedure. The approach consists of seven consecutive steps. The most central ones concern the hierarchical allocation of ecological assessment endpoints, and the harmonization of the scoring procedure of attributes (ecological indicators or assets) to a common scale from 0 to 1. We demonstrate the approach integrating three programs developed to assess the hydromorphological river condition in Switzerland, Germany, and the USA. In our example, the integrated assessment produces comparable results for the whole range from natural to impacted rivers, while data continuity with original assessments was maintained. Our approach provides a common assessment standard due to the definition of the minimum amount of information required, is flexible regarding measurement and assessment endpoints, and bridges the gap between river quality assessment and management.

AB  - The concept of ecological integrity is increasingly being used to guide monitoring efforts across North American public land agencies. We provide a history of this concept and outline its primary components on the basis of the scholarly literature. We then examine established structures and processes that incorporate the best available science, spatial and temporal concerns, and management relevance into frameworks for measuring and reporting on ecological integrity. To understand how this is applied in practice, we provide examples from two land-management agencies in North America that have used ecological integrity as a concept to organize their monitoring programs. Laws, agency guidance, organizational structure, and collaborative processes strongly influence the outcomes of ecological integrity-monitoring programs. Further research in this area would be valuable to better understand how different types of land-management agencies can effectively monitor ecological integrity across various spatial and temporal scales and in the context of climate change.

AB  - Estuaries, lagoons and lakes, identified as transitional waters (TWs), are fragile ecotones at the interface between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The assessment of their Ecological Quality status (EcoQ), required by marine legislations, is rather uncertain when based on traditional benthic macrofaunal indices. This study proposes to assess the EcoQ of marine waters using the diversity index Exp(H-bc') based on living benthic foraminifera. By testing this method on datasets from five Italian TWs, we showed that EcoQ's assessment based on foraminifera reflected changes in environmental conditions. Benthic foraminifera highlighted the degradation of most, if not all, study sites, ranking most of the TWs in "Moderate" to "Bad" EcoQs. Although the assessment of EcoQs estimated from diversity indices was similar when based on benthic foraminifera or macrofauna, discrepancies occurred if diversity index calculated on foraminifera and sensitivity-based indices applied on macrofauna were compared. Our results demonstrated that the Exp(H-bc') index based on living benthic foraminifera is a promising approach to assess EcoQs. Finally, we argue that benthic foraminifera, for their preservation potential as fossil within sediment, are a reliable option to define reference conditions and targets.

AB  - The concept of Ecological Integrity (EI) refers to the capacity of a place to sustain and maintain the biota in such conditions that allows it to function as a balanced, integrated and adaptive system, and can be derived by comparing present vs. past or spatial reference baseline conditions. Here we assess the EI of Playa El Rivero (34. 2'29.35 '' S, 53.32'21.14 '' W) in Punta Del Diablo resort, Uruguay. This 600 m-length, previously unstudied sandy beach is one of the main attractions of the resort, receiving thousands of tourists during summer. Accordingly, conspicuous human impacts are concentrated in the more dissipative end of the beach. In order to derive EI values, a large number of indicators (n=20), including population and community level univariate descriptors for benthic macrofauna, as well as direct indicators of EI (AMBI, M-AMBI and Buckland indices) were assessed and integrated. The distribution of population and community level variables were compared across the along-shore axis with the expected distribution under the Swash Exclusion Hypothesis (SHE) and the Habitat Harshness Hypothesis (HHH), which predict a decrease in richness, biomass and abundance from reflective to dissipative conditions. To derive a global value, an EI value was calculated for population and community levels as well as according to direct impact indicators. EI thus ranged from 1 (no measurable or significant impacts) to 0 (completely dysfunctional system). Integrating all types of indicators, a value of 0.76 was obtained for the beach under study. This value integrates both chronic and putative "press'' disturbance occurring during the high tourist season in the period under study and suggests a sub-optimal state (ca. 20% reduction) of the health of the system studied, probably related to the sum of chronic anthropogenic impacts that the beach arc presents. This value is considered as an objective (but probably conservative) reference point in order to evaluate the effectiveness of future management measures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem monitoring often fails to provide the right information to evaluate and guide environmental stewardship due to a lack of diagnostic capacity, long-term operational resources, explicit monitoring objectives and rigorous sampling designs. Our objective is to describe a monitoring framework that addresses these failures by including causative conceptual models and the concepts of adaptive monitoring and management. Resources are rarely available to monitor all ecosystem components, so identifying priorities is vital for the success of a monitoring program. An ecological risk assessment combining available information and expert opinion on threats and their consequences to the ecosystem can be used to prioritise monitoring and identify explicit objectives. A Pressure-Stressor-Response conceptual model forms the causative understanding of the ecosystem and the model components underpin the factors in the risk assessment. In this way, field sampling can validate the priority of ecosystem threats; provide information for refinement of conceptual understandings and guide efficient management activity. Repeated risk assessments using updated data and information can identify successful management and the increase and establishment of threats. Updated risk assessments can change threat priorities and therefore monitoring and assessment hypotheses and objectives can change. This ability to change underlies the concepts of adaptive monitoring and management.

AB  - Principles of sustainability were mentioned for the very first time in the Ore Mountains in Central Europe some 300 years ago, triggered by the shortage of timber. Always new problems and challenges occurred throughout history caused by changes in ecosystems, which influenced sustainability aspects. This region was marked by drastic environmental impacts, particularly strong SO2 immissions in the second half of the 20th century. Since the political transformation of 1989, both air quality and the functioning and integrity of ecosystems have improved and the rehabilitation of the destroyed forests and degraded peatbogs has begun. The ups and downs of landscape development, in particular the crises in the human-environment relationship in the region, were not only associated with changes in the ecosystem, but also with a process of gaining and structuring knowledge, concept development, and communications. In this paper, we provide a framework for assessing sustainable land use management, and to demonstrate it by way of examples of successful implementation in the Ore Mountains region. In this context we will focus on such important ecological approaches as the concepts of ecosystem research, ecological indicators, ecological integrity, and ecosystem services. Thus, we describe the demand for integrating available knowledge into conceptual approaches, and moving into implementation procedures by means of integrated land management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biological indicators of ecosystem integrity are increasingly being sought for use in ecosystem assessment and goal-setting for restoration projects. We tested the effectiveness of a plant community-based bioassessment tool, the floristic quality assessment index (FQAI) in 20 depressional wetlands in Ohio, USA. A priori, the 20 depressional wetlands were classified by type and ranked to form a disturbance gradient according to the local landscape condition. Ranks were based on surrounding land cover characteristics, vegetated buffer characteristics, and the extent of human-induced hydrologic alteration at the wetland site. The index was negatively correlated with the disturbance rank of a wetland and with the distance to neighboring wetlands (P = 0.01). Index values were lower for wetlands surrounded by agricultural or urban land use, wetlands with less vegetation on the wetland perimeter, and wetlands with more hydrologic modification, and at sites with greater distances to other wetlands. The wetlands with lower FQAI values tended to be dominated by plants that are typical of heavily cultivated landscapes or urban regions. Thus, the index is interpreted as a measure of environmental factors that maintain and control plant communities. The index was not correlated with differences in wetland surface water chemistry (alpha = 0.05) but was positively correlated with soil total organic carbon (P = 0.01), phosphorus (P = 0.05), and calcium (P = 0.05). Repeated wetland sampling in the summer and autumn revealed that the floristic quality assessment index could be useful for the assessment and monitoring of wetland ecosystems and for tracking wetland restoration projects over time.

AB  - To explore the potential of assessments of stream geomorphic condition and habitat quality in evaluating lotic productivity, we investigated concordance of stream biotic productivity ( aquatic macroinvertebrates, crayfish, fish, and belted kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon)) and their physical habitat correlates in 18 streams in the Champlain Valley, Vermont, USA. Pearson correlation analysis indicated significant concordance between macroinvertebrate density and fish biomass (r = 0.76), between the density of macroinvertebrates in the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera and fish biomass (r = 0.81), and between fish biomass and kingfisher brood weight (r = 0.54). We used principal component analysis followed by linear regression to investigate relationships between physical habitat condition and biotic productivity and to identify key components of physical habitat condition assessments. Our analysis supported the combined use of geomorphic and habitat assessments as a comprehensive indicator of stream physical habitat condition. We found relationships between habitat assessment scores and productivity measures of all taxa except crayfish, suggesting similar responses to physical condition across trophic levels. Our results encourage the use of additional taxa, in addition to widely used macroinvertebrate metrics, as indicators of the composite effects of physical habitat impairment in stream ecosystems.

AB  - Impairment of numerous water resources by anthropogenic stress has caused degradation, which reduces their ecological integrity, a combination of physicochemical and biological integrity. Techniques to assess impairment may be broadly divided into physicochemical, biological, and habitat assessments. Most physicochemical analyses are conducted in the laboratory. Biological techniques are divided into field measurements such as population and community level approaches using indigenous organisms as indicators of stress and laboratory measurements such as toxicology, which generally use field collected or laboratory raised animals to assess pollution effects on individual organisms. Impacted sites are compared with relatively unimpacted sites to estimate damage. While physicochemical and toxicological approaches have been largely standardised and are widely used, suitable protocols for field based bioassessments are relatively new, often not standardised, and not widely used. Since each approach provides unique information on water quality, integration of available methods is critical in providing a battery of assessment techniques to act as appropriate precursors to remedial action that may lead to recovery.

AB  - Zoosporic fungi (chytrid) abundance, as captured on pollen bait, was significantly higher in pristine sites than impacted sites in a survey of six water bodies of varying ecological integrity (as categorized by the NJ Pinelands Commission) in the New Jersey pine barrens (USA). Using a series of laboratory manipulations of water from a pristine and an impacted site, altered pH appeared to be the primary driver of zoosporic fungi abundance in the field. Increasing pH of the naturally acid water of the pine barrens, significantly reduced zoosporic fungal populations and a reduction of pH of impacted water ameliorated conditions and increased abundance. The addition of nitrogen or phosphorus to, or an increase in specific conductance of, pristine water reduced zoosporic fungal abundance, but a reduction in these parameters in impacted water did not induce restoration of zoosporic fungi. These results show zoosporic fungi have potential as bioindicators of pollution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Selection of reference sites is a critical component in the process of developing and applying biological indicators of ecological condition. Some evidence suggests that despite its importance the rules by which reference sites are selected have not always been evaluated critically to assure that the sites represent least-disturbed conditions. We present a comparison of physical and chemical disturbance measures and biotic indices at handpicked reference sites provided by resource agencies and at sites selected by a probability design from a 12-state survey of western streams and rivers. In most cases, the distributions of disturbance measures and biotic index scores were essentially the same for both types of sites; that is, only a subset of the handpicked reference sites represented least-disturbed conditions. We recommend that all agencies that use reference sites critically review those sites with a set of explicit criteria, using field-collected data as well as mapped information.

AB  - An analysis of the results of the 12-year regular monitoring (2000-2012) of benthic communities in Saronikos Gulf and Elefsis Bay (Eastern Mediterranean, Greece) in relation to the functioning of the Psittalia Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and advances in treatment is presented. Benthic community indicators applied include the Bentix index adopted for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD); the diversity and species richness proposed in combination with the Bentix index for the evaluation of certain attributes of the Sea-floor Integrity descriptor for the marine waters of Greece, under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), and the evenness index. The benthic and environmental data were treated according to the distance from the outfall, largely accounting for the variance of the indicators, to investigate trends along the monitoring. Results showed an upgrade of the condition of the benthic communities of Saronikos Gulf throughout the monitoring period mostly demonstrated by the Bentix and diversity indices. A change in the trends of most indices was especially evident after 2004, especially in the areas more adjacent to the outfall zones, when the advanced secondary biological treatment plant was completed and commissioned. Sediment parameters' trend patterns indicate a delayed reaction to recovery processes in relation to benthic indices. An evaluation of the current status of the benthic communities based on the indices applied showed a gradient from a moderate ecological status at stations up to a distance of 8,000 m from the outfalls to good environmental and ecological status at more remote stations. At shallower stations located at a distance of more than 4,000 m from the outfall, benthic communities also present good environmental status. In Elefsis Bay, the enclosed physiography, shallower depth and local pressures result in more adverse environmental conditions for benthic communities and a more complex influence from WWTP advances.

AB  - Deforestation is a major threat globally, but especially in tropical regions because they are biodiversity strongholds and carbon storehouses. Some studies have reported changes in species richness and composition in lotic ecosystems with increased forest-loss in their catchment, presumably resulting from the replacement of sensitive taxa by more resistant or tolerant taxa. Also, sensitive taxa respond to deforestation in a non-linear manner and fish and macroinvertebrates have different sensitivities to landscape pressures. Therefore, it is useful to determine the effects of forest-loss on widespread sensitive or threshold taxa in aquatic ecosystems. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to assess forest-loss and land use history impacts in 92 eastern Amazonian stream sites. We determined TITAN peak-change thresholds for fish at 1% and 6% of forest-loss at total-catchment and local-riparian spatial extents, respectively, and at 2% and 40% of land-use intensity change at total-catchment and local-riparian spatial extents, respectively. For macroinvertebrates, TITAN peak-change thresholds were 1% and 11% of forest loss at total-catchment and local-riparian spatial extents, respectively, and at 3% of land-use intensity change for both total-catchment and local-riparian spatial extents. Because of these thresholds, inherent ecoregional variability and key literature, we have three major recommendations. 1) Logging should be prohibited in riparian reserves that are at least 100-m wide on each side of headwater streams and in a network of catchments across all biomes and as many landscape types as possible. 2) An ecologically and statistically rigorous monitoring program with standard methods should be implemented to assess and regulate land uses better. 3) Conservation planning areas should consider aquatic biota as well as terrestrial biota.

AB  - Canada's national parks system includes 43 terrestrial parks covering 3% (276,275 km(2)) of the country's landmass and representing its full range of natural regions. Considering the vast and often remote areas under protection, Parks Canada Agency envisions Earth Observation technology to be the basis for a Park Ecological Integrity Observing System (Park-EIOS), and integral component of a larger national parks ecological integrity (EI) monitoring program. Park-EIOS is planned for operational use beginning in 2008 and includes coarse filter El indicators corresponding to landscape pattern, succession and retrogression, net primary productivity, and focal species distributions within parks and their surrounding greater park ecosystems. A primary input to produce all four indicators is a time series of land cover information derived from medium (similar to 30 m) resolution, Landsat-class sensors. This paper describes a generic, end-to-end change detection framework developed for Park-EIOS, labelled Automated Multi-temporal Updating through Signature Extension (AMUSE). AMUSE involves radiometric normalization steps, production of a baseline land cover, change vector analysis to identify changed pixels, and a new constrained signature extension approach to update the land cover of changed areas. We present the method and results applied to six pilot parks using time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery from 1985-2005. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to a high number of specialized species and unique environmental conditions, alpine spring ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to environmental change and human impact. Therefore, the assessment of ecosystem integrity through habitat monitoring over long periods of time is of particular importance, especially in protected areas. Bioindication by conventional ecosystem assessment and monitoring includes sampling whole communities and morphological species identification. This approach, however, brings along major drawbacks such as high invasiveness, low reproducibility, low specificity and is relatively time-consuming. To overcome these issues, we developed a targeted bioindicator species eDNA detection approach for representative freshwater macroinvertebrate species and compared the results with detection through conventional sampling. Macro invertebrates of 15 springs, located in the Swiss National Park and the UNESCO biosphere reserve Engiadina Val Mustair, were sampled using a hand-net and species were morphologically identified. We selected six spring bound species: Hygrobates norvegicus, Partnunia steinmanni, Dictyogenus fontium, Protonemura lateralis, Lithax niger, and Wormaldia occipitalis and designed novel, species-specific qPCR primers and hydrolysis probes. Spring eDNA was collected by filtering 1.5 l water through cellulose nitrate filter funnels and DNA extracts were screened by qPCR for the selected bioindicator species. Results showed congruence between conventional and eDNA qPCR-based species detection. The assay targeting L. niger was less sensitive and qPCR performance in eDNA samples was decreased compared to the other species, indicating the necessity for careful indicator species choice and evaluation. The newly developed eDNA-based qPCR protocols allow detecting indicator species in alpine springs and represent a non-invasive, sensitive and specific, cost-and time-effective alternative to conventional biomonitoring approaches. Particularly in protected areas such as the Swiss National Park, the implementation of indicator species detection in eDNA filtered water samples can be beneficial and fosters sustainable freshwater ecosystem monitoring and assessment.

AB  - The objectives of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program for Great River Ecosystems (EMAP-GRE) are to (1) develop and demonstrate, in collaboration with states, an assessment program yielding spatially unbiased estimates of the condition of mid-continent great rivers; (2) evaluate environmental indicators for assessing great rivers; and (3) assess the current condition of selected great river resources. The purpose of this paper is to describe EMAP-GRE using examples based on data collected in 2004-2006 with emphasis on an approach to determining reference conditions. EMAP-GRE includes the Upper Mississippi River, the Missouri River, and the Ohio River. Indicators include biotic assemblages (fish, macroinvertebrates, plankton, algae), water chemistry, and aquatic and riparian physical habitat. Reference strata (river reaches for which a single reference expectation is appropriate) were determined by ordination of the fish assemblage and examination of spatial variation in environmental variables. Least disturbed condition of fish assemblages for reference strata was determined by empirical modeling in which we related fish assemblage metrics to a multimetric stressor gradient. We inferred least disturbed condition from the y-intercept, the predicted condition when stress was least. Thresholds for dividing the resource into management-relevant condition classes for biotic indicators were derived using predicted least disturbed condition to set the upper bound on the least disturbed condition class. Also discussed are the outputs of EMAP-GRE, including the assessment document, multimetric indices of condition, and unbiased data supporting state and tribal Clean Water Act reporting, adaptive management, and river restoration.

AB  - The South African grassland system is home to over 3,300 plant species, 15 of the country's 34 endemic mammal species, 12 of the 40 endemic bird species (four of which are globally threatened) and five RAMSAR wetland sites. To assess and address the ecological integrity of farmed grasslands we used process-oriented techniques, including nesting success and field metabolic rates (FMR) of birds, and an adaptation of the multi-taxon biodiversity intactness index (BII) using plant, arthropod and bird diversity data which is a comprehensive tool for assessing ecological integrity using multiple taxonomic groups. Current pastoral management practices have a significant detrimental effect on avian abundance, species richness, nest density and fledgling output. Overall energy turnover and BII values confirm the importance of conserved areas for birds in moist highland grassland systems and support the need for further conservation efforts in grassland systems by both private landowners and reserve managers. Findings based on both avian FMRs and the BII in this study were found to be comparable, lending support to the use of FMR as a rapid assessment technique for assessing ecosystem integrity for future studies of this nature. Scenarios of potential biodiversity improvement with changes in fire management regimes are also presented.

AB  - Given the continuing degradation of freshwater wetland ecosystems throughout the Southeast, there has been significant interest in developing methods and indices to evaluate and monitor wetland biological integrity. The purpose of this study was to adapt and test the ability of a vegetation-based assessment technique known as Floristic Quality Assessment to detect the level of human impact in hardwood flat wetlands of Southeastern Virginia. We measured plant species diversity and composition within each vertical stratum [herbaceous, woody understory (shrub and sapling), and canopy] of I I wetlands. We calculated a Floristic Quality Index (FQI) for each layer, and tested for relationship to land use disturbance patterns within defined site buffer and watershed areas. We found floristic quality of the herbaceous layer and the sapling portion of the woody understory layer to be negatively correlated with level of land use disturbance at both buffer and watershed scales, suggesting that FQI scores within these strata reflect current anthropogenic stress. While FQI of the canopy layer and the shrub portion of the woody understory layer were not reliable indicators of current land use disturbance, we found that a comparison of sapling and canopy layer FQIs gave insights into historic vs. recent floristic integrity of sites. Overall, our findings support the use of floristic quality assessments in evaluating wetland biological integrity when sampling and index calculation methodology are carefully adapted to local flora and community types.

AB  - Chronological studies (1951-1995) of the changing land use in three river basins belonging to the Tagus fluvial system (Portugal) were conducted using remote sensing data. The spatial characteristics of riparian woody vegetation and the temporal changes therein were quantified using landscape metrics such as average riparian canopy width, length of stand canopy closure types on river segments and patchiness indicators (e.g., the number of changes between types per survey unit). We also studied the predictive potential of geomorphology and climate features for explaining biological variability. We identify significant spatio-temporal land use changes on the adjacent floodplains, accompanied by remarkable differences in riparian integrity. Neither fragmentation patterns nor the loss or increase of riparian cover were consistent with similar land use changes throughout the rest of the studied basins, particularly in urbanizing landscape patches. The longitudinal patterns of streamside forests along Mediterranean-type rivers - particularly in Iberia - appear to be complex and dependent upon the previous life-history features of land use. Results also suggest that the proximity, type and extension of land use patch interplay influence the degree of changes in riparian integrity, which in overall terms displayed appreciable resistance to alterations and indirect disturbance. The results are broadly discussed with regard to spatial fine-grained scale changes in both land use and riparian integrity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human activities are increasingly affecting freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, especially in neotropical regions like the Brazilian savanna. Limited research and data availability have inhibited the development and implementation of systematic bioassessment programs and management guidelines. Identifying drivers of biological assemblages' composition and ecological thresholds along human disturbance gradients is an important step to protect and recover freshwater ecosystems while avoiding threats to biodiversity, goods and services of value to humans. The objectives of this study were to: 1) assess changes in the composition and density of periphytic diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages relative to natural and human disturbance gradients in Brazilian savanna's streams, and 2) identify ecological thresholds for direct and indirect human disturbances and potential indicator taxa that could inform the development of biomonitoring programs in Brazil and other neotropical countries. Samplings were carried out in 52 stretches of streams located in central Brazil during two campaigns throughout 2018. Ordination analyses (NMDS) were applied to identify the main drivers of biological assemblages' composition and analyses of taxa distribution in disturbance gradients (TITAN) were carried out to detect possible thresholds and potential bioindicator taxa. Our results pointed out that the scale of land use in the catchment, treated sewage input, and water quality variables (nitrate, phosphate, and conductivity) were the main drivers of diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Taxa such as Eunotia (diatoms) and some families of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT, macroinvertebrates) were associated with natural conditions, while Nitzschia palea and Gomphonema (diatoms) and Oligochaeta and Hirudinea (macroinvertebrates) were related to environments with a higher degree of disturbance. Although ecological thresholds along disturbance gradients varied among taxa and biotic groups, our results revealed that relatively minor increases in land use in the riparian zone (>0%) and in the upstream catchment (0-33%) were sufficient to trigger significant changes in macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages. The limits of tolerance for conductivity, nitrate and phosphate were also low, varying between 7-163 mu S.cm(-1), 0.3-1.0 mg.L-1 and 0.03-1.5 mg.L-1, respectively. In general, the values we found were more restrictive than those provided by Brazilian government guidelines, suggesting that the latter would be insufficient to maintain the integrity of biological assemblages in Brazilian savanna's watersheds. We provided valuable knowledge about the sensitivities and tolerances of diatom and macroinvertebrate's taxa/assemblages that can be especially useful for the proper freshwater and watersheds management.

AB  - This research paper presents an adaptive methodology that integrates the Bayesian network (BN) with the Monte Carlo algorithm for the cost-based assessment of an offshore asset in a harsh corrosive environment. The BN explores the various integrity influential factors from design to failure of an offshore pipeline, considering the dynamic interrelationships among core elements. This is defined based on the unstable and stochastic nature of the degradation influential variables, such as those in microbial corrosion mechanisms. The model captures the variability in the cost parameters using the dynamic discretization formalism in the BN structure to predict the corrosion integrity cost for predefined offshore operations. The Monte Carlo algorithm is used to forecast the failure characteristics of the asset based on the formulated failure functions. The cost function output is used as the baseline cost rate estimator for the multiple failure modes' cost prediction for the period under consideration. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with a subsea pipeline. The outcomes reveal the effect of the cost elements' variability and the corrosivity index on the overall integrity management strategy. The proposed adaptive approach provides a cost-based asset integrity management tool for offshore operations suffering stochastic degradation.

AB  - Rapid qualitative field methods can be used to evaluate ecological integrity (EI) at a landscape level. This study evaluates the EI of 63 landscape types (LCTs) in Cyprus derived from Landscape Character Mapping. Following a stratified sampling, LCTs were evaluated using 209 Land Description Units (LDUs) i.e., homogeneous map entities, sharing a similar pattern of natural and cultural elements. In every LDU, six ecological integrity (EI) indicators were visually assessed consistently namely naturalness, habitat continuity, number of habitats, dominant habitat type, management intensity and scale. TwoStep Cluster Analysis was employed to identify EI categories, and Categorical Principal Components Analysis (CATPCA) to associate the individual indicators with overall EI in the LDUs. Linear regressions were used to predict EI based on the most important indicators. Forested and shrubland landscapes have consistently good EI with low variation, while urbanized and agricultural landscapes have lower EI. There is great variation in the number of agricultural landscape types and their EI. There are significant linear relationships between EI and naturalness, habitat continuity and intensity. The novelty of this work lies with the fact that it provides the first island-wide study in the Mediterranean assessing EI spatially through a small number of indicators. Results indicate that LCA can be an appropriate consistent and inexpensive spatial framework for assessing EI, which can be directly associated with management intervention to maintain or improve EI.

AB  - Taken literally, the aim of biodiversity monitoring is to track changes in the biological integrity of ecosystems. Given the overwhelmingly dominant contribution of invertebrates to biodiversity, no biodiversity monitoring programme can be considered credible if invertebrates are not addressed effectively. Here we review the use of terrestrial invertebrates, with a particular focus on ants, as bioindicators in Australia in the context of monitoring biodiversity in Australia's rangelands. Ant monitoring systems in Australia were initially developed for assessing restoration success following mining, and have since been applied to a wide range of other land-use situations, including grazing impacts in rangelands. The use of ants as bioindicators in Australia is supported by an extensive portfolio of studies of the responses of ant communities to disturbance, as well as by a global model of ant community dynamics based on functional groups in relation to environmental stress and disturbance. Available data from mining studies suggest that ants reflect changes in other invertebrate groups, but this remains largely undocumented in rangelands. The feasibility of using ants as indicators in land management remains a key issue, given the large numbers of taxonomically challenging specimens in samples, and a lack of invertebrate expertise within most land-management agencies. However, recent work has shown that major efficiencies can be achieved by simplifying the ant sorting process, and such efficiencies can actually enhance rather than compromise indicator performance.

AB  - The input of nutrients into rivers and other aquatic ecosystems is one of the most common causes of damage to the integrity of the ecosystem. The use of biological communities for water quality assessment is a common and effective practice. Among these biological indicators, the fish community is one of the most used in monitoring programs and ecosystems studies and so there is much knowledge about their response to the process of eutrophication. In this study we analyzed the fish composition, diversity and evenness in fourteen reaches. of low stream orders within a basin with differing land use intensity. The structure of the fish community was related with physiochemical water composition by canonical correspondence analysis, which enabled us to group the fish species according to their specific tolerance to eutrophication. Oligotrophic habitats were characterized by a higher evenness, larger individuals, a fish composition of at least 40% of sensitive species (Crenicichla scotti, Gymnogeophagus gymnogenis, Gymnogeophagus sp., Heptapterus mustelinus, Hoplias malabaricus and Rhineloricaria sp.) and less than 20% of very tolerant ones (Astyanax fasciatus, Cnesterodon decenmaculatus, Corydoras paleatus, Cyphocharax yoga, Hisonotus sp., Pimelodella australis). Eutrophic reaches showed the opposite community features and a fish composition with more than 40% of very tolerant species and less than 20% of sensitive ones. Among the fourteen study reaches, four were classified as oligotrophic, six as mesotrophic and four as eutrophic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three investigations are underway, as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program, to study the relation between varying levels of urban intensity in drainage basins and in-stream water quality, measured by physical, chemical, and biological factors. These studies are being conducted in the vicinities of Boston (Massachusetts), Salt Lake City (Utah), and Birmingham (Alabama), areas where rapid urbanization is occurring. For each study, water quality will be sampled in approximately 30 drainage basins that represent a gradient of urban intensity. This paper focuses on the methods used to characterize and select the basins used in the studies. It presents a methodology for limiting the variability of natural landscape characteristics in the potential study drainage basins and for ranking the magnitude of human influence, or urbanization, based on land cover, infrastructure, and socioeconomic data in potential study basins. Basin characterization efforts associated with the Boston study are described for illustrative purposes.

AB  - This study reviewed the existing experience of implementing the nation-wide freshwater health evaluation in China and around the world and proposes a new framework that works in collaboration with the River Chief System (RCS). The institutional context of China with intertwined political and scientific considerations makes it essential to establish a concise and quantitative approach to assess the effectiveness of the RCS as well as local freshwater health conditions that can be easily understood by non-experts for decision-making. To fulfil this objective, we reconstructed the indicator categories based on the best practices in major western countries and the existing regional standards in China. The new indicator framework includes two main aspects: Ecosystem integrity (physical habitat, water quantity, water quality, and aquatic life) and non-ecological performance (social services and water governance). Specifically, the non-ecological attributes of freshwaters are in accordance with the purposes of the RCS and are usually ignored in many countries. The final health grade for a specific water body is determined by a weighted averaging method; this grade is the core element of an evaluation protocol designed to produce reliable data for adaptable water resources governance in China. The research findings in this study will also be integrated into the new national standard to be issued by the Ministry of Water Resources of China in late 2020.

AB  - Between 1994 and 1995 we sampled invertebrate and fish communities of the lower Enz River, a second order tributary of the Rhine River (total length, 108 km, mean annual discharge, 16.6-23.9 m(3) s(-1)), in the vicinity of man-made weirs, their associated fishways, and more natural river sections. We focused on the ecological consequences of these man-made alterations to river morphology and flow conditions on the presence/absence and relative densities of invertebrate feeding groups, including the effects on fish and benthos habitat preference types. We further attempted to identify species useful as indicators of morphological integrity, particularly of physical disturbance of lotic habitats typical for the Enz River. We found pronounced differences in species composition and abundance, and in the contribution of feeding groups and habitat preference types, between disturbed and more natural sites. For example, the benthic community characteristics of two bypass fishways were quite similar to each other, but differed from those found in the respective adjacent river sections, suggesting a local 'rhithralisation' effect of fishways that mimic artificial streams. Among the 109 invertebrate and the 28 fish taxa identified, both the presence/absence and the abundance of some species or functional groups were useful indicators of the morphological integrity of typical riverine habitats. The mayfly Oligoneuriella rhenana, for example, occurred almost exclusively in riffle sections, and its density correlated positively with turbulent, high velocity currents and the presence of larger rocks.

AB  - Rivers in mediterranean regions are subject to hydrological extremes. They range from highly stable, perennial ground- or snow-fed systems to highly ephemeral, unpredictable ones in semi-arid environments. Spatial and temporal complexity inherent in these systems presents challenges for ecological status assessment and defining reference conditions, particularly as many areas have been extensively transformed through anthropogenic activities. Temporal variability driven by sequential and predictable, seasonal events of flooding and drying accentuates the need to take season and/or hydrological period into account. Intermittent streams, which are common in mediterranean regions (med-regions) and which have aquatic communities distinct from perennial streams, are often not incorporated in bioassessment and present distinct challenges. Med-regions are also known for their high biodiversity and rates of endemism, as well as large numbers of introduced species. Med-regions are expected to be among the most affected by global climate change and, in these systems, climate change is an additional driver influencing ecosystems that are already stressed. From this review it is evident that an understanding of responses of indices, metrics, and models to climate change in comparison to existing stresses, and the development of thermally specific bioassessment tools are needed for this region.

AB  - 1. The ability of many introduced fish species to thrive in degraded aquatic habitats and their potential to impact on aquatic ecosystem structure and function suggest that introduced fish may represent both a symptom and a cause of decline in river health and the integrity of native aquatic communities.
   2. The varying sensitivities of many commonly introduced fish species to degraded stream conditions, the mechanism and reason for their introduction and the differential susceptibility of local stream habitats to invasion because of the environmental and biological characteristics of the receiving water body, are all confounding factors that may obscure the interpretation of patterns of introduced fish species distribution and abundance and therefore their reliability as indicators of river health.
   3. In the present study, we address the question of whether alien fish (i.e. those species introduced from other countries) are a reliable indicator of the health of streams and rivers in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. We examine the relationships of alien fish species distributions and indices of abundance and biomass with the natural environmental features, the biotic characteristics of the local native fish assemblages and indicators of anthropogenic disturbance at a large number of sites subject to varying sources and intensities of human impact.
   4. Alien fish species were found to be widespread and often abundant in south-eastern Queensland rivers and streams, and the five species collected were considered to be relatively tolerant to river degradation, making them good candidate indicators of river health. Variation in alien species indices was unrelated to the size of the study sites, the sampling effort expended or natural environmental gradients. The biological resistance of the native fish fauna was not concluded to be an important factor mediating invasion success by alien species. Variation in alien fish indices was, however, strongly related to indicators of disturbance intensity describing local in-stream habitat and riparian degradation, water quality and surrounding land use, particularly the amount of urban development in the catchment.
   5. Potential confounding factors that may influence the likelihood of introduction and successful establishment of an alien species and the implications of these factors for river bioassessment are discussed. We conclude that the potentially strong impact that many alien fish species can have on the biological integrity of natural aquatic ecosystems, together with their potential to be used as an initial basis to find out other forms of human disturbance impacts, suggest that some alien species (particularly species from the family Poeciliidae) can represent a reliable 'first cut' indicator of river health.

AB  - Offshore wind power generation represents a chance to supply energy in a more sustainable way; however, the ecological risks associated with the construction and operation of offshore wind farms are still largely unknown. This paper uses the concept of ecological risk for analysing ecological changes during construction of offshore wind farms. "Ecological risk" is defined as the potentially reduced ability of providing ecosystem services. The ERSEM ecosystem model allows assessing ecological risk based on a number of selected variables (integrity indicators) and under the assumption that increased suspended matter concentration during construction of wind farms affects ecosystem functioning. We conclude that ecological risk is adequate to describe the effects of wind farm constructions, although the computation procedure still needs to be refined and the choice of indicators further optimised. In this context, the choice of indicators available in modelling as well as in monitoring time-series may offer the way forward.

AB  - We demonstrate the use of multiple indicators to characterize the ecological integrity of a coastal plain stream system in the New Jersey Pinelands in relation to human-induced watershed alterations. The individual indicators include pH, specific conductance, stream vegetation and stream-fish, impoundment-fish, and anuran assemblages. We evaluate and compare the utility of the individual and multiple environmental and biological indicators and present a relatively straightforward method for ranking sites. Specific conductance and pH measured at 88 monitoring sites varied in relation to the percentage of altered land (developed land and upland agriculture) within the associated watersheds. All three environmental variables were associated with variations in the composition of stream vegetation and stream fish, impoundment fish, and anuran assemblages. With the exception of impoundment fish, the association between altered land and the multiple-indicator scores based on the two water-quality indicators and the four biological indicators was stronger than that displayed by any of the individual variables.

AB  - Managers of protected areas are under increasing pressure to measure their effectiveness in conserving native biological diversity in ways that are scientifically sound, practical, and comparable among protected areas over time. The Nature Conservancy and its partners have developed a "Measures of Success" framework with four core components: (1) identifying a limited number of focal conservation targets, (2) identifying key ecological attributes for these targets, (3) identifying an acceptable range of variation for each attribute as measured by properly selected indicators, and (4) rating target status based on whether or not the target's key attributes are within their acceptable ranges of variation. A target cannot be considered "conserved" if any of its key ecological attributes exceeds its acceptable range of variation. The framework provides a rigorous basis not only for measuring success but for setting conservation objectives, assessing threats to biodiversity, identifying monitoring and research needs, and communicating management information to nonspecialists.

AB  - Rangelands support many ecosystem services important to humans, including climate regulation. They also have a significant role to play in the mitigation of greenhouse gases. However, the capacity of any rangeland to do this depends foremost upon the condition of biodiversity, and the functioning of its ecosystems. Considerable research has been undertaken on rangeland condition but it has not yet included the assessment of biodiversity (plants, animals and microbes) as a primary focus. Rangeland managers have struggled to assess biodiversity condition because it is rarely defined, is everywhere (so what do you assess?), is always changing in response to natural and human disturbances (so how do you know when it has changed?) and what amount signals management action. Here we present a framework that addresses these issues, and apply it to select surrogates and indicators that are scientifically defensible in biological and planning terms for assessing biodiversity. An arid Australian rangeland region is used as a case study to develop and apply our approach. We were not able to illustrate interpretation of condition because of the absence of long-term monitoring data in Australian rangelands, but we do provide guiding principles about sampling design and analytical methods for interpretation that use raw data rather than multimetrics. We discovered that different management outcomes expected to be informed from assessing biodiversity condition affected surrogate and indicator choice, and that a number indicators were not robust when assessed on conceptual relevance, measurement qualities, feasibility of implementation and policy and management relevance for four different management outcomes. Our work highlights the importance of stating the expected outcomes of biodiversity condition assessments up front, so that indicators relevant to future management are chosen. It also shows that critical thought on the robustness of indicators is warranted, especially as condition assessments under climate change will require information on the functional traits of species. We conclude by assessing the strengths and weaknesses of our framework in relation to environmental planning.

AB  - The ecosystem service concept is becoming more and more acknowledged in science and decision-making, resulting in several applications in different case studies and in environmental management, but still it is developing in terms of definitions, typologies and understanding its complexity. By examining the interrelations between ecosystem properties, ecosystem integrity, biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being qualitatively, the mutual influences on each constituent of the 'ecosystem service cascade' are illuminated, giving an impulse for further discussions and improvements for a better understanding of the complexity of human environmental systems. Results of the theoretical interactions are among others the assumption that provisioning services exclude or compete with each other, while the role of biodiversity was found to be supporting for regulating services and cultural services. Ecosystem services meet the criteria of being adequate human environmental system indicators and therefore, they are an appropriate instrument for decision-making and management.

AB  - The soils of the studied area function in different temperature regimes: under the influence of permafrost (Turbic Histic Cryosol and Cryic Eutric Histosol) and long-term seasonal freezing (Albic Podsol). Sporadic permafrost defines the differences in temperature regimes. All soils are characterized by the low production of carbon dioxide (an average of 160 mg CO2/(m(2) h)), indicating their low biological activity. The lack of easily available carbon for microorganisms is detected in all investigated soils by the C-mic: C-org ratio despite the high reserves of organic matter. The value of CO2 emission and the C-mic: C-org ratio are "site-specific" for the region of investigation and may be used as indicators of environmental changes. Cryogenic peat soils represent a unique natural object and ensure the functional diversity and integrity of northern taiga ecosystems in Western Siberia.

AB  - Site grouping by regions or typologies, site-specific modeling and varying metrics among site groups are four approaches that account for natural variation, which can be a major source of error in ecological assessments. Using a data set from the 2007 National Lakes Assessment project of the USEPA, we compared performances of multimetric indices (MMI) of biological condition that were developed: (1) with different lake grouping methods, ecoregions or diatom typologies; (2) by varying or not varying metrics among site groups; and (3) with different statistical techniques for modeling diatom metric values expected for minimally disturbed condition for each lake. Hierarchical modeling of MMIs, i.e. grouping sites by ecoregions or typologies and then modeling natural variability in metrics among lakes within groups, substantially improved MMI performance compared to using either ecoregions or site-specific modeling alone. Compared with MMIs based on ecoregion site groups, MMI precision and sensitivity to human disturbance were better when sites were grouped by diatom typologies and assessing performance nationwide. However, when MMI performance was evaluated at site group levels, as some government agencies often do, there was little difference in MMI performance between the two site grouping methods. Low numbers of reference and highly impacted sites in some typology groups likely limited MMI performance at the group level of analysis. Varying metrics among site groups did not improve MMI performance. Random forest models for site-specific expected metric values performed better than classification and regression tree and multiple linear regression, except when numbers of reference sites were small in site groups. Then classification and regression tree models were most precise. Based on our results, we recommend hierarchical modeling in future large scale lake assessments where lakes are grouped by ecoregions or diatom typologies and site-specific metric models are used to establish expected metric values.

KW  - TROUT
AB  - Increasing our ability to synthesize and compare fisheries assessment data among species and across geographic boundaries should facilitate a better understanding of the broad-scale condition of fish resources and necessary management strategies. We describe the Conservation Success Index (CSI), a new tool to analyze the status of native salmonids and facilitate protection, restoration, reintroduction, and monitoring efforts. The CSI provides a framework to evaluate indicators of population integrity, habitat integrity, and future security within native salmonids across all subwatersheds within their historic range. To date, the CSI has been completed for seven native trout and char species with summary status maps, data sheets, spatial analyses of management needs, and analysis of climate change and energy development impacts available at http://tucsi.spatialdynamics.com. Additional species are added annually. Case studies using Bonneville cutthroat trout and brook trout illustrate how the CSI provides a multi-scaled description of management priorities that can be combined with site-specific data to design needed restoration. Although specifically developed by Trout Unlimited to prioritize the organization's conservation work and to assist our members in understanding broad-scale conservation needs, the CSI may be useful to other organizations as a fisheries management or environmental education tool.

AB  - Bioassessment methods are critically needed to evaluate and monitor lake ecological condition. Aquatic macrophytes are good candidate indicators, but few lake bioassessment methods developed in North America use them. The few macrophyte bioassessment methods that do exist suffer from problems related to subjectivity and discernibility along disturbance gradients. We developed and tested a bioassessment approach for 462 north temperate lakes. The approach links macrophyte abundance to lake ecological condition via estimates of taxon-specific abundance-weighted tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance. Using variables related to eutrophication, urban development and agriculture, we calculated abundance-weighted tolerance ranges for 59 macrophyte taxa and clustered them according to their tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance. We also created a composite index of anthropogenic disturbance using 20 variables related to population density, land cover and water chemistry. We used a statistical approach to set ecological condition thresholds based on the observed abundance of sensitive, moderately tolerant and tolerant taxa in each lake. The resulting lake condition categories were usually stable across multiple survey events and largely agreed with condition rankings assigned using expert judgment. We suggest using, this macrophyte bioassessment method for federal water quality reports, restoration and management on north temperate lakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - (1) This investigation developed and tested descriptive models designed to evaluate coral reef ecological condition based on data developed using the basic techniques most often used in coral reef surveys.
   (2) Forty-three variables at 184 stations were analysed in order to identify specific factors that are useful metrics for describing reef condition.
   (3) The common practice of using 'reference sites' for paired site comparisons was evaluated by developing a reference site model (RSM). This use of reference sites proved to be subjective and unreliable, especially when multiple factors and multiple sites are involved. However, in some cases the RSM is appropriate in demonstrating severe degradation based on factors such as sediment, coral cover and fish abundance.
   (4) An objective ecological gradient model (EGM) was developed based on a wide range of metrics at numerous sites. A computer program was developed that allows a quantitative ranking of reef condition along a continuum and can be used to compare reefs across a wide range of conditions. Further, this approach permits the operator to alter and define criteria appropriate to a specific question.
   (5) Results of this investigation provide ecological insights into the importance of natural and anthropogenic ecological factors in determining coral reef condition. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Many existing parks are currently experiencing difficulties in achieving their conservation aims, yet they remain an important option for maintaining and enhancing the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem processes. Critics have claimed that many national parks cannot continue to protect the biological resources within their borders, and the sustainability of these areas over the long-term is in question. Ways need to be found to strengthen those that are failing, and to understand and replicate those that are succeeding. This paper presents the empirical results from a systematic evaluation of how effectively six case study national parks and national park reserves in Canada and South Africa have been protecting ecological integrity. Several parks were effective at addressing the priorities for which they had monitoring data, however the effectiveness rating of each park decreased when all indicators, including those identified as priorities but lacking monitoring data, were analysed. This indicates that the parks had generally identified more priority indicators than they were actually able to address (for many reasons, including lack of budget or trained staff, managerial challenges). Overall, a systematic approach to evaluating ecological integrity in national parks is recommended as the managers of protected areas cannot be expected to conserve the biological diversity and ecosystem processes within their borders if they are unaware of the ecological status of the park's biodiversity. The paper concludes with several practical recommendations for monitoring ecological integrity in national parks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the integrity of fish assemblages of a small anthropogenically impacted urban stream system in south-western Germany. Heavy point and non-point pollution physiologically stresses the aquatic fauna while migration barriers and river morphological alterations negatively influence habitat availability. Investigations conducted in 1998 and 1999 revealed that the fish assemblage was altered and several site-specific fish species were missing while non-site-specific species were relatively common. Highest species diversity was recorded in a reach downstream of the main migration barrier, while upstream only a few species were present. In general, a shift to ubiquitous and limnophilic species as well as to less pollution sensitive species was observed. Adult fish dominated the population structure throughout the stream course. Recruitment was confined mainly to the less polluted headwater. In the present study we introduce an assessment system based on the similarity of the potential natural and the actually established fish assemblage as demanded by the Water Framework Directive of the European Union for the evaluation of the ecological status of a fish assemblage in a stream [EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of Europe establishing a framework for community action in the field of water policy. Brussels, 30 June, 2000. 1997/0067 (COD)]. Both, stream morphological quality and pollution data sampled within the two study years confirm the validity of the suggested assessment method.

AB  - A large data set from the Eastern Mediterranean was analyzed to explore the relationship between seawater column variables and benthic community status. Our results showed a strong quantitative link between the seawater column variables (Chlorophyll a and Eutrophication Index) and various indicators describing benthic diversity and community composition. The percentage of benthic opportunistic species increased significantly in the stations with high trophic status of the seawater column and so did the strength of the coupling between values of seawater column and benthic indicators. The Eutrophication Index threshold level of 0.85, separating the "Bad and Poor" from "Moderate to High" conditions could serve as an acceptable critical value above which there is a readily observable change in benthic community composition.

AB  - We developed fish assemblage-based multimetric indices as indicators of ecological conditions for the lower Missouri, impounded upper Mississippi, unimpounded upper Mississippi, and Ohio rivers. Using data from 475 daytime electrofishing samples, we calculated 81 candidate fish metrics. We screened these metrics for their range and their responsiveness to a multimetric stressor gradient that included water chemistry, human disturbance, and landscape-scale indicators of human disturbance and stress. Each reach-specific great-river fish index (GRFIn) included 8-10 nonredundant metrics scored on a continuous scale from 0 to 10 (10 = good). No metrics were common to all four GRFIns; one metric (the number of minnow species) was common to three GRFIns. We determined the least disturbed conditions from the y-intercepts of the quantile regressions between the GRFIn scores and the corresponding stressor gradients. Ecological condition as indicated by GRFIn score varied among reaches; 44 +/- 8% (95% confidence interval around the mean) of the lower Missouri River (by length), 51 +/- 20% of the unimpounded upper Mississippi River, 43 +/- 8% of the impounded upper Mississippi River, and 39 +/- 7% of the Ohio River was most disturbed.

AB  - P>1. In this issue we aimed to answer the questions: (i) under what circumstances are functional variables better than structural ones for assessing ecosystem health? and (ii) are there good indicators of change in ecological functioning along perturbation gradients?
   2. Of the numerous functional indicators tested in this issue, several show a response to anthropogenic stress and could be included in assessments of ecosystem health and integrity in running waters.
   3. In three of eight studies, function showed a stronger response to anthropogenic stress than structure, whereas one study showed a response in structure and not function, and four studies showed responses in both structure and function. Thus structure alone could not detect all types of impairment and functional aspects should also be included and further developed for assessing running-water ecosystem health and integrity. Functional variables may be especially useful in situations where there is a stronger response among organisms not usually included in stream assessment (e.g. fungi and bacteria) than the commonly used invertebrate, macrophytes and fish indicators.
   4. Leading research questions related to the use of functional indicators in running waters include: (i) how large is natural and operator-induced variation for functional indicators? (ii) how small of an effect size (delta) can be detected using structural versus functional indicators? and (iii) how do we efficiently improve theories as well as predictive ability for functional measures to assess the effects of anthropogenic stressors?
   5. To advance the use of functional indicators in applied running-water studies, we need to supplement the approach of using large-scale datasets and correlation with ecosystem manipulations.

AB  - The composition of nematode communities (plant-parasitic and free-living) may be used as bioindicators of soil health or condition because composition correlates well with nitrogen cycling and decomposition, two critical ecological processes in soil. Maturity and trophic diversity indices withstand statistical rigor better than do abundances, proportions, or ratios of trophic groups. Maturity indices respond to a variety of land-management practices, based largely on inferred life history characteristics of families. Similarity indices may be more useful than diversity indices because they reflect taxon composition. Improving existing indices or developing alternative indices refined by a greater understanding of the biology of key taxa may enhance the utility of nematodes as bioindicators.

AB  - Riparian vegetation is an important determinant of the physical, chemical, and biological condition of streams, and odonates are useful indicators of riparian condition. To identify environmental factors that structure Odonata assemblages in tropical forest streams, we collected adult odonate specimens and habitat data from 50 stream sites located in the Brazilian municipality of Paragominas (Para state). We collected 1769 specimens representing 11 families, 41 genera, and 97 species. Of these species, 56 were Zygoptera, and 41 were Anisoptera. Improved environmental condition was reflected in increased Zygoptera species richness and reduced Anisoptera species richness. Channel shading was strongly and positively related to Zygoptera richness, and negatively to Anisoptera richness. Zygoptera species richness, but not Anisoptera species richness, was related positively to bank angle, quantity of wood in the stream bed, electrical conductivity, and decreased water temperature. Altered riparian vegetation structure was the principal determinant of odonate assemblage structure. Our results indicate that maintaining intact riparian vegetation is fundamental for conserving or reestablishing aquatic odonate assemblage structure.

AB  - Estuarine ecosystems are becoming increasingly altered by the concentration of human populations near the coastline, however a robust indicator of this change is lacking. We developed an index of waterbird community integrity (IWCI) and tested its sensitivity to anthropogenic activities within 28 watersheds and associated subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay, USA. The IWCI was used as a tool to gain insight into how human land use affects estuarine ecosystem integrity. Based on Akaike's information criteria (AIC), a single variable model including percent developed land in estuarine watersheds was thirteen (2002) and twenty-six (2003) times more likely than models including percent agriculture and forest cover to fit the IWCI data. Consequently, we examined how suburban, urban, and total development shaped IWCI scores at three spatial scales: (1) watershed; (2) inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) watershed (land cover near the coastline weighted proportionally greater than that farther away); (3) local (land cover within 500 m of the coastline). Suburban, urban, and total development were all significant predictors of IWCI scores. Relationships were stronger at the IDW and local scales than at the whole watershed scale. Nonparametric changepoint analysis revealed a >80% probability of a threshold in IWCI scores when as little as 3.7% (2002) and 3.5% (2003) of the IDW land cover within the watershed was urban. Our results indicate that, of the landscape stressors we examined, development near estuarine coastlines is the primary stressor to estuarine waterbird community integrity; and that estuarine ecosystem integrity may be impaired by even extremely low levels of coastal urbanization.

AB  - In this study we evaluated whether pteridophytes are reliable indicators of urban forest integrity. We inventoried the total pteridophyte diversity in 82 forest patches of the Hochelaga Archipelago (Montreal area, Quebec, Canada), and evaluated their level of integrity using landscape metrics (e.g., area, connectivity, matrix composition) calculated from satellite imagery and land use maps. To obtain information at microhabitat scale, we sampled pteridophyte diversity, as well as biotic and abiotic data, in 225 sample plots within these 82 patches. Relationships of pteridophyte richness to landscape metrics and to microhabitat variables were analyzed with parsimonious regression models. Variation partitioning was used to isolate the effects of each group of variables (forest area, land use, biotic/abiotic and edge effect). To enhance the interpretation of models involving richness, distance-based redundancy analyses of species composition data were performed. Indicator species of low and high levels of urban influence were then identified using the IndVal method. Results showed a strong species-area relationship that was influenced by surrounding land use. Pteridophyte richness decreased with increasing proportions of residential areas, urban heat islands (UHI) and water bodies in a 500 m-buffer zone around patches. Greater richness at the microhabitat scale was associated to greater distance from internal and external edges. Out of 38 species, 19 were significant indicators of low levels of urban influence. We conclude that pteridophytes are positive indicator of forest integrity, since they demonstrate typical plant responses to adverse urban-generated ecological conditions. Green-spored species are of particular interest, since their presence indicates low levels of UHIs. Impact of global climate changes on biodiversity can be predicted by studying UHls, and we suggest using pteridophytes in this broader context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental impact studies of rivers affected by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have been greatly restricted by the difficulties associated with carrying out bioassays in the field and also by the complex interactions between the pollutants contained in the discharges. The cotton-strip assay (CSA) enables study of the organic matter decomposition potential, an important ecosystem process in rivers, by taking all of the factors affecting this process into account. However, the CSA has never been used for assessment of WWTP effluents. In the present study, we selected six fluvial zones affected by discharges from small WWTPs and placed cotton strips at increasing distances from the discharge points in each zone. After 17 days, we evaluated decay of the strips by measuring cotton tensile strength loss (CTSL) and cotton mass loss (CML). We then determined the relationships between these parameters and various physico-chemical and biological properties in the water, as well as the delta N-15 isotopic signal and metal contents of aquatic mosses transplanted in the same sampling sites and used as biomonitors. Although the WWTPs were similar, some of the discharges stimulated and others inhibited decomposition of the cotton strips. This was probably due to differences in the proportions of various types of pollutants (with trophic or toxic effects) in the discharges. The CSA proved to be a simple, practical and economic bioassay and suitable for evaluating the ecological integrity of fluvial ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organic-matter decomposition has long been proposed as a tool to assess stream functional integrity, but this indicator largely depends on organic-matter selection. We assessed eight decomposition-based indicators along two well-known environmental gradients, a nutrient-enrichment gradient (0.2-1.4 mg DIN/L) in central Portugal and an acidification gradient (pH: 4.69-7.33) in north-eastern France to identify the most effective organicmatter indicator for assessing stream functional integrity. Functional indicators included natural leaf litter (alder and oak) in 10-mm and 0.5-mm mesh bags, commercial tea (Lipton green and rooibos teas in 0.25-mm mesh bags), wood sticks (wood tongue depressors) and cotton strips. Biotic indices based on benthic macroinvertebrates (IPtIN for Portugal and IBGN for France) were calculated to compare the effectiveness of structural and functional indicators in detecting stream impairment and to assess the relationship between both types of indicators. The effectiveness of organic-matter decomposition rates as a functional indicator depended on the stressor considered and the substrate used. Decomposition rates generally identified nutrient enrichment and acidification in the most acidic streams. Decomposition rates of alder and oak leaves in coarse-mesh bags, green and rooibos teas and wood sticks were positively related with pH. Only decomposition rates of rooibos tea and wood sticks were related with DIN concentration; decomposition rates along the nutrient-enrichment gradient were confounded by differences in shredder abundance and temperature among streams. Stream structural integrity was good to excellent across streams; the IPtI N index was unrelated to DIN concentration, while the IBGN index was positively related with pH. The relationships between decomposition rates and biotic indices were loose in most cases, and only decomposition rates of alder leaves in coarse-mesh bags and green tea were positively related with the IBGN. Commercial substrates may be a good alternative to leaf litter to assess stream functional integrity, especially in the case of nutrient enrichment.

AB  - Large river systems are one of the most important water resources for human societies. However, the ecological integrity of large rivers has been altered greatly by human activities. To monitor and manage these ecosystems, multimetric indices (MMI) are considered as efficient tools. This study aimed to develop and validate a fish-based multimetric index for the Karun River basin, Iran (Karun fish-based multi-metric index [KFMMI]). Eighteen rivers and 54 sites in the basin were sampled in July-August 2019, and physico-chemical and habitat characteristics were used to identify reference sites based on principal components analysis (PCA). Of the 54 sites, 14, 26, and 14 sites were classified as least, moderate, and most disturbed sites, respectively. Fifty-four candidate metrics were evaluated for range, responsiveness, and redundancy with other metrics. This resulted in the identification of eight metrics (relative abundance of native and endemic taxa, relative richness of migratory taxa, relative richness of Leuciscidae taxa, relative richness of herbivorous taxa, relative abundance of cyprinid taxa, relative richness of vegetative inhabitant taxa, relative abundance of slow water flow, and relative richness of edge inhabitant taxa) that informed on species richness and composition, migratory status, functional feeding groups, and habitat preferences. The KFMMI showed excellent performance in separating least, moderate, and most disturbed sites in our study area. Regarding water quality, the KFMMI was classified 16, 5, and 29 sites as good, moderate, and bad, respectively. The discrimination efficiency of KFMMI was 81.6%, which makes it an effective management tool for directing restoration actions at most disturbed sites and intensifying protection of least disturbed sites.

AB  - We evaluated patterns of herbivory and predation/scavenging by a small mammal, the arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii), as an indicator of biological diversity, vegetation structure, and ecological integrity on two contrasting islands in the vast and remote Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Using DNA metabarcoding techniques, we assessed the taxonomic composition of vertebrates, vascular plants, and bryophytes at family and growth form levels in arctic ground squirrel fecal samples collected on the ecologically intact island of Chowiet, which supports diverse seabird and vegetation communities, and the degraded island of Chirikof, which has incurred centuries of disturbance from introduced arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and cattle (Bos taurus taurus). We also evaluated whether fecal samples collected across the growing season (May-August) could act as indicators of herbivore-plant phenology. We did not detect any vertebrate taxa, however, observed herbivory patterns closely matched known differences in island plant diversity based on independent surveys. Diets from the ecologically intact island exhibited higher taxonomic richness, greater evenness, and higher shrub content than the ecologically degraded island, which is a grass- and forb-dominated ecosystem. On Chowiet Island, diets changed seasonally, likely in response to changing availability, nutritional quality, and toxin content associated with primary production. Small mammal diet served as an effective indicator of plant diversity, vegetation structure, and ecological integrity when compared against known composition and status of these remote island ecosystems. Non-invasive fecal sampling and dietary analyses using genetic techniques may provide a useful strategy for monitoring biological diversity, particularly in remote areas where widespread intensive sampling is unfeasible.

AB  - The high rates of environmental change and accelerated species loss in the urban development process should be quantified to rebalance the social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. In this study, an emergy-based environmental impact assessment model is designed according to the framework of the Eco-Indicator 99 for monitoring the negative effects on human well-being and ecosystem integrity in the urban development system of Beijing from 1999 to 2006. The environmental impact assessment model is based on the sustainability promotion perspective, and emphasizes the determinants of human health and ecosystem integrity in the urban development process. It is vital that the links among human health, ecosystem integrity and urban sustainability are therefore considered especially from the perspective of a supply-side environmental cost evaluation (including ecological service supply, ecological and economic losses and investment for treatment). Results suggest that: (1) out of all the pollutants, ecological services were mainly used to dilute sulfur dioxide and NH3-N; (2) nitrogen dioxide and greenhouse gases released by the urban system contribute heavily to both ecological and economic losses evaluated in emergy terms; and (3) emissions impact, mainly from airborne pollutants, with small contribution from waterborne emissions, generally increases from 1999 to 2006, undermining the sustainability of Beijing. The emergy synthesis proves to be very appropriate to account for large-scale and indirect costs generated by pollution as side effects of economic activity.

AB  - Conservation planning based on the occurrence of rare species has been criticized as being too limited in scope to conserve biodiversity as a whole. Conversely, planning based on indicator taxa may lack sufficient focus to conserve those species in greatest need of conservation. An alternative approach is to identify a variety of species at risk that are associated with areas of conservation value, which is defined based on species-independent characteristics. We identified potential indicators of conservation value using occurrence data on species at risk and independent information on conservation value that incorporated indices of ecosystem integrity. We propose a taxonomically diverse group of indicator species that-are strongly associated with areas of exceptional ecosystem integrity, to serve as a focus for further research and in planning for biodiversity conservation.
   We identify potential indicator species by defining a null model in which species at risk are equally associated with areas of high ecosystem integrity, then by conducting randomization tests to identify noncompliant species in the state of Michigan, USA. Areas of high ecosystem integrity are selected using criteria to flag (1) secure biotic communities with structural integrity and few exotic species, (2) natural areas subjected to expert review, (3) contiguous relict areas of forest interior, (4) contiguous areas of unmodified wetland, and (5) all these areas combined. We determine the spatial occurrence of species at risk using data from Michigan's statewide Natural Heritage database.
   The potential indicators include plants, insects, and birds. Their species identity and distribution of occurrences varies with the five scenarios, and together the species broadly cover the entire state. These species at risk, many of which occur throughout the Great Lakes region, may be used to identify additional areas potentially high in conservation value and to monitor their conservation. The ecological criteria and numerical methods we employ may be broadly applicable as Heritage Program databases in North America and parts of Latin America grow to become representative of species distributions.

AB  - Data collected from 172 sites in 20 major river basins between 1993 and 1995 as part of the US Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program were analyzed to assess relations among basinwide land use (agriculture, forest, urban, range), water physicochemistry, riparian condition, and fish community structure. A multimetric approach was used to develop regionally referenced indices of fish community and riparian condition. Across large geographic areas, decreased riparian condition was associated with water-quality constituents indicative of nonpoint source inputs-total nitrogen and suspended sediment and basinwide urban land use. Decreased fish community condition was associated with increases in total dissolved solids and rangeland use and decreases in riparian condition and agricultural land use. Fish community condition was relatively high even in areas where agricultural land use was relatively high (>50% of the basin). Although agricultural land use can have deleterious effects on fish communities, the results of this study suggest that other factors also may be important, including practices that regulate the delivery of nutrients, suspended sediments, and total dissolved solids into streams. Across large geographic scales, measures of water physicochemistry may be better indicators of fish community condition than basinwide land use. Whereas numerous studies have indicated that riparian restorations are successful in specific cases, this analysis suggests the universal importance of riparian zones to the maintenance and restoration of diverse fish communities in streams.

AB  - Fish are considered as reliable indicators of environmental quality and during the last decades several fish-based indices have been developed to assess the ecological status of water bodies in compliance with the water framework directive. The high number of fish species with a high degree of endemism, lack of knowledge on ecological requirements of certain fish species, absence of a complete dataset for reference conditions, and great variation among freshwater types complicate the development of fish-based indices for Turkish freshwaters. However, this is still possible using statistical approaches. This paper presents a practical guide which is mainly based on the recent approaches that have frequently been used in other countries worldwide. Data collection, metric selection and scoring, ecological quality ratio (EQR) calculation and validation steps are described and discussed with respect to the limitations and available data for Turkish freshwaters. The guide documented here, with minor adjustments, has a potential to be adopted as a fish-based assessment approach for the ecological status in freshwaters in Turkey and adjacent countries.

AB  - Recreational, reclaimed and drinking source waters worldwide are under increasing anthropogenic pressure, and often contain waterborne enteric bacterial, protozoan, and viral pathogens originating from non-point source fecal contamination. Recently, the capsid integrity (ci)-qPCR, utilizing the azo-dyes propidium monoazide (PMA) or ethidium monoazide (EMA), has been shown to reduce false-positive signals under laboratory conditions as well as in food safety applications, thus improving the qPCR estimation of virions of public health significance. The compatibility of two widely used human adenovirus (HAdV) qPCR protocols was evaluated with the addition of a PMA/EMA pretreatment using a range of spiked and environmental samples. Stock suspensions of HAdV were inactivated using heat, UV, and chlorine before being quantified by cell culture, qPCR, and ci-qPCR. Apparent inactivation of virions was detected for heat and chlorine treated HAdV while there was no significant difference between ci-qPCR and qPCR protocols after disinfection by UV. In a follow-up comparative analysis under more complex matrix conditions, 51 surface and 24 wastewater samples pre/post UV treatment were assessed for enteric waterborne HAdV to evaluate the ability of ci-qPCR to reduce the number of false-positive results when compared to conventional qPCR and cell culture. Azo-dye pretreatment of non-UV inactivated samples was shown to improve the ability of molecular HAdV quantification by reducing signals from virions with an accessible genome, thereby increasing the relevance of qPCR results for public health purposes, particularly suited to resource-limited low and middle-income settings.

AB  - Mediterranean river ecosystems are subjected to intense human pressures and impacts that affect both their aquatic and riparian communities. However, given their stratified position in the river ecosystem and varying ecological requirements, aquatic and riparian communities can respond differently to such pressures. These biological responses could also vary depending on the nature of the disturbances, the spatial scale considered and the indicators used as response variable. Here, we aim to assess the influence of the main human pressures present in Mediterranean rivers (agricultural land use and hydromorphological alteration) on the biodiversity and ecological condition indicators of both riparian and aquatic communities at two spatial scales: reach and basin. For this purpose, a total of 56 sampling sites covering the study area (Segura basin, SE Spain) were surveyed. Water beetles and woody riparian vegetation richness were used respectively as biodiversity surrogates of aquatic and riparian communities, and the Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party (IBMWP) and Riparian Quality Index (RQI) were used to assess the ecological status of both communities. As expected, we found a general decrease in both richness and ecological condition when human pressures increased, regardless of the spatial scale considered. Nonetheless, agricultural land use was the main pressure explaining riparian richness and quality, whereas aquatic communities' responses were highly related to hydromorphological alteration. Contrary to expected, in general, variables at basin scale had a greater effect than those variables operating at local scale. In addition, ecological condition indices responded more clearly to human pressures than biodiversity surrogates. Therefore, land use and hydrological planning at basin scale are essential complements to conservation and restoration efforts, traditionally carried out at reach scale, in order to maintain stream ecosystem integrity and biodiversity.

AB  - This paper describes the development, application, and evaluation of a method for assessing the effectiveness of stream restoration activities in enhancing four lotic habitats based on the presence of habitat specialists. Three genera were identified as specialists for indicators of the enhancement of woody debris, coarse bed substrate, fine roots, and leaf pack habitats. These indicator genera were determined for each habitat type through indicator species analysis, extensive literature review, and consultation with local experts and a statewide distribution database. Water quality influences were isolated by excluding taxa with low tolerance to degraded water quality conditions. The difference in the presence of indicator genera between pairs of upstream-restored reaches was used to evaluate the success of the restoration activities in re-establishing benthic habitats. Application of this methodology to 27 paired reaches in the North Carolina Piedmont indicated that no change in specialists was the most frequent result of restoration, particularly for the woody debris habitats, when each habitat was examined individually. By combining the habitats into a composite score, a distinction by land use emerged, with habitats in urban areas indicating the greatest enhancement, while presence of the indicator genera at the agricultural and rural sites showed no clear trend of improvement or degradation in response to the restoration activities. When this composite IG metric was compared to the EPT taxa richness metric and RBP scores, the dependency of the EPT taxa richness metric on upstream conditions and the improvement in discriminatory ability over the RBP score suggest that this indicator genera (IG) metric provides a distinct signal for representing the biological perspective on the enhancement of benthic habitats by stream restoration activities. While further development of the methodology is desirable, this framework introduces a valuable alternative for evaluating benthic habitat enhancement in various hydrogeographic and land use conditions, and is constructive for guiding restoration designs to maximize biotic integrity.

AB  - Protected area management agencies are increasingly using management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) to better understand, learn from and improve conservation efforts around the globe. Outcome assessment is the final stage of MEE, where conservation outcomes are measured to determine whether management objectives are being achieved. When quantitative monitoring data are available, best-practice examples of outcome assessments demonstrate that data should be assessed against quantitative condition categories. Such assessments enable more transparent and repeatable integration of monitoring data into MEE, which can promote evidence-based management and improve public accountability and reporting. We interviewed key informants from marine protected area (MPA) management agencies to investigate how scientific data sources, especially long-term biological monitoring data, are currently informing conservation management. Our study revealed that even when long-term monitoring results are available, management agencies are not using them for quantitative condition assessment in MEE. Instead, many agencies conduct qualitative condition assessments, where monitoring results are interpreted using expert judgment only. Whilst we found substantial evidence for the use of long-term monitoring data in the evidence-based management of MPAs, MEE is rarely the sole mechanism that facilitates the knowledge transfer of scientific evidence to management action. This suggests that the first goal of MEE (to enable environmental accountability and reporting) is being achieved, but the second and arguably more important goal of facilitating evidence-based management is not. Given that many MEE approaches are in their infancy, recommendations are made to assist management agencies realize the full potential of long-term quantitative monitoring data for protected area evaluation and evidence-based management.

AB  - Environmental flow assessment frameworks have begun to consider changes to flow regimes resulting from land-use change. Urban stormwater runoff, which degrades streams through altered volume, pattern and quality of flow, presents a problem that challenges dominant approaches to stormwater and water resource management, and to environmental flow assessment. We used evidence of ecological response to different stormwater drainage systems to develop methods for input to environmental flow assessment. We identified the nature of hydrologic change resulting from conventional urban stormwater runoff, and the mechanisms by which such hydrologic change is prevented in streams where ecological condition has been protected. We also quantified the increase in total volume resulting from urban stormwater runoff, by comparing annual streamflow volumes from undeveloped catchments with the volumes that would run off impervious surfaces under the same rainfall regimes. In catchments with as little as 5-10% total imperviousness, conventional stormwater drainage, associated with poor in-stream ecological condition, reduces contributions to baseflows and increases the frequency and magnitude of storm flows, but in similarly impervious catchments in which streams retain good ecological condition, informal drainage to forested hillslopes, without a direct piped discharge to the stream, results in little such hydrologic change. In urbanized catchments, dispersed urban stormwater retention measures can potentially protect urban stream ecosystems by mimicking the hydrologic effects of informal drainage, if sufficient water is harvested and kept out of the stream, and if discharged water is treated to a suitable quality. Urban stormwater is a new class of environmental flow problem: one that requires reduction of a large excess volume of water to maintain riverine ecological integrity. It is the best type of problem, because solving it provides an opportunity to solve other problems such as the provision of water for human use.

AB  - Conservationists and protected area managers spend millions in establishing and maintaining protected areas every year. However, many studies revealed that the design and coverage of protected areas are still inadequate in representing key biodiversity features, are insufficient in the management approach to address the threats and pressures and have a low level of ecological integrity because of the increasing levels of environmental degradation. There is strong evidence of different anthropogenic pressures that deteriorate the effectiveness of existing protected areas, structurally, compositionally and functionally. Hence, the evaluation of a protected area's effectiveness is very crucial in maintaining long-term biodiversity conservation. Different evaluations have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of protected areas but focus only on certain issues or a single component. Current effectiveness evaluations still inadequately incorporate important criteria to make the evaluation of protected areas more comprehensive. Therefore, this paper will first focus on reviewing the current conditions and threats towards biodiversity conservation in tropical protected areas. Then, there will be a discussion on the relationship between the threats that cause issues with the effectiveness of protected areas. From issues that influence protected areas, the criteria or components that are crucial in developing the consolidated index model are identified. The main objective of this paper is to propose a consolidated index model that integrates the components of design and planning, ecological integrity and management to assess the conservation effectiveness of individual terrestrial protected areas in tropical regions. Hence, this paper presents the first step to develop a consolidated index model that can be implemented by park managers to assess conservation effectiveness.

AB  - Physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the Kentucky River and its tributaries were assessed for one year to compare effects of seasonal, spatial, and human environmental factors on phytoplankton. Phytoplankton cell densities were highest in the fall and summer and lowest in the winter. Cell densities averaged 1162 (+/- 289 SE) cells ml(-1). Cell densities were positively correlated to water temperature and negatively correlated to dissolved oxygen concentration and to factors associated with high-flow conditions (such as, suspended sediment concentrations). Chrysophytes, diatoms, and blue-green algae dominated winter, spring, and summer assemblages, respectively. Ordination analyses (DCCA) indicated that variation in taxonomic composition of assemblages was associated with stream size as well as season.
   Spatial variation in phytoplankton assemblages and effects of humans was investigated by sampling 55 sites in low flow conditions during August. Phytoplankton density increased with stream size. Assemblages shifted in composition from those dominated by benthic diatoms upstream to downstream communities dominated by blue-green algae and small flagellates. Human impacts were assumed to cause higher algal densities in stream basins with high proportions of agricultural or urban land use than in basins with forested/mined land use. While density and composition of phytoplankton were positively correlated to agricultural land use, they were poorly correlated to nutrient concentrations. Phytoplankton diversity changed with water quality: decreasing with nutrient enrichment and increasing with conditions that probably changed species composition or inhibited algal growth. Human impacts on phytoplankton in running water ecosystems were as great or greater than effects by natural seasonal and spatial factors. Our results indicated that phytoplankton could be useful indicators of water quality and ecosystem integrity in large river systems.

AB  - Despite a wealth of methods currently proposed by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) to assess macro-benthic integrity, determining good ecological status (GES) and assessing ecosystem recovery following anthropogenic degradation is still one of the biggest challenges in marine ecology research. In this study, our aim was to test a number of commonly used structural (e.g. Shannon-Wiener, Average Taxonomic Diversity (Delta), M-AMBI) and functional indicators (e.g. BTA, BPc) currently used in benthic research and monitoring programmes on the Eden estuary (Scotland). Historically the estuary has a legacy of high nutrient conditions and was designated as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2003, whence major management measures were implemented in order to ameliorate the risk of eutrophication symptoms. We therefore collected data on intertidal macro-benthic communities over a sixteen year interval, covering a pre-management (1999) and post-management (2015) period to assess the effectiveness of the intended restoration efforts. In the post-management period, the results suggested an improvement in the structure and functioning of the estuary as a whole, but macro-benthic assemblages responded to restoration variably along the estuarine gradient. The greatest improvements were noticed in the upper and central sites of the estuary with functional traits analysis suggesting an increased ability of these sites to provide ecosystem services associated with the benthic environment such as carbon and organic matter cycling. Generally, almost all of the structural and functional indicators detected the prevailing environmental conditions (with the exception of (Pielou's index and Average Taxonomic Diversity (.)), highlighting the appropriateness of such methods to be used in monitoring the recovery of transitional systems. This research also provides a robust baseline to monitor further management actions in the Eden estuary and provides evidence that notable reductions in nitrate concentrations resulting from NVZ designations may result in significant improvements to benthic structure and functioning.

AB  - Regional variation in both natural environment and human disturbance can influence performance of ecological assessments. In this study we calculated 5 types of benthic diatom multimetric indices (MMIs) with 3 different approaches to account for variation in ecological assessments. We used: site groups defined by ecoregions or diatom typologies; the same or different sets of metrics among site groups; and unmodeled or modeled MMIs, where models accounted for natural variation in metrics within site groups by calculating an expected reference condition for each metric and each site. We used data from the USEPA's National Rivers and Streams Assessment to calculate the MMIs and evaluate changes in MMI performance. MMI performance was evaluated with indices of precision, bias, responsiveness, sensitivity and relevancy which were respectively measured as MMI variation among reference sites, effects of natural variables on MMIs, difference between MMIs at reference and highly disturbed sites, percent of highly disturbed sites properly classified, and relation of MMIs to human disturbance and stressors. All 5 types of MMIs showed considerable discrimination ability. Using different metrics among ecoregions sometimes reduced precision, but it consistently increased responsiveness, sensitivity, and relevancy. Site specific metric modeling reduced bias and increased responsiveness. Combined use of different metrics among site groups and site specific modeling significantly improved MMI performance irrespective of site grouping approach. Compared to ecoregion site classification, grouping sites based on diatom typologies improved precision, but did not improve overall performance of MMIs if we accounted for natural variation in metrics with site specific models. We conclude that using different metrics among ecoregions and site specific metric modeling improve MMI performance, particularly when used together. Applications of these MMI approaches in ecological assessments introduced a tradeoff with assessment consistency when metrics differed across site groups, but they justified the convenient and consistent use of ecoregions.

AB  - A linkage between the condition of watersheds and adjacent nearshore coral reef communities is an assumed paradigm in the concept of integrated coastal management. However, quantitative evidence for this "catchment to sea" or "ridge to reef" relationship on oceanic islands is lacking and would benefit from the use of appropriate marine and terrestrial landscape indicators to quantify and evaluate ecological status on a large spatial scale. To address this need, our study compared the Hawai'i Watershed Health Index (HI-WHI) and Reef Health Index (HI-RHI) derived independently of each other over the past decade. Comparisons were made across 170 coral reef stations at 52 reef sites adjacent to 42 watersheds throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. A significant positive relationship was shown between the health of watersheds and that of adjacent reef environments when all sites and depths were considered. This relationship was strongest for sites facing in a southerly direction, but diminished for north facing coasts exposed to persistent high surf. High surf conditions along the north shore increase local wave driven currents and flush watershed-derived materials away from nearshore waters. Consequently, reefs in these locales are less vulnerable to the deposition of land derived sediments, nutrients and pollutants transported from watersheds to ocean. Use of integrated landscape health indices can be applied to improve regional-scale conservation and resource management.

AB  - The Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) uses 2 forms of benthic macroinvertebrate indicators for detection of stream impairment, a multimetric index (MMI) and a predictive model of observed to expected taxa. (O/E), each of which is calibrated to streams across the state. As part of the routine monitoring program, some sample locations were subjected to repeated sampling, i.e., multiple samples were collected from stream reaches in spatial and temporal proximity. Results from repeated sampling allow calculation of precision estimates, which are important for describing a portion of the uncertainty (systematic error) associated with field sampling and site assessments. In this project, we evaluated 131 and 77 repeated-sample pairs for the MMI and O/E, respectively, using 4 different measures of precision: coefficient of variability (CV), 90% confidence intervals, relative % difference (RPD), and % difference for the final assessments. MMI and O/E had similar consistency and repeatability. Segregating the data set and calculations by region or field method yielded generally similar precision estimates for the indicators, although precision was slightly better in the mountains using the Hess field-sampling method than in other regions or with other field methods. Evaluation of RPD showed that assessments (impaired/nonimpaired) on the basis of the MMI differed between samples in 18.3% of repeated-sample pairs and assessments on the basis of O/E differed between samples for 19.5% of repeated-sample pairs. Recommended measurement quality objectives were 10 to 15% for CV and 15 to 20% for RPD for both indicators. Field-sampling precision was the focus of our paper, but we emphasize that detecting the presence of stressors or degraded conditions is the primary objective of the MDEQ stream condition indicators.

AB  - Arthropods play vital roles in various ecosystem functions and respond acutely to habitat manipulation. Diversity and community dynamics of arthropods are strongly correlated with ecosystem functioning. Arthropod community structure reflects habitat heterogeneity, as well as development and recovery of forest ecosystems after natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Arthropod community structure also reflects the degree of fragmentation and isolation of forest ecosystems on the landscape. Arthropods are good indicators of the overall biodiversity and ecosystem integrity of forests and can be used for evaluating and designing sound ecosystem management plans.

AB  - Understanding the concordance among different assemblages as well as their responses to the environmental gradients at multiple spatial scales is an important issue in conservation biology and in the assessment of ecological integrity. We examined the community concordance among diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish in minimally disturbed streams on four nested spatial scales (i.e., national, catchment, sub-catchment and mountain or lowland at sub-catchment scales) in Korea. The results, based on non-metric multidimensional scaling, showed that diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish displayed consistent patterns that were strongly structured along an altitude gradient at the national scale. However, the responses to all other influential environmental factors differed by assemblages. The community composition of fish closely reflected the gradients of larger scale environmental factors (i.e., geographical and hydrological variables), whereas macroinvertebrates mainly reflected the changes at relatively finer environmental scales (e.g., hydrological variables and substrate composition). Diatoms showed relatively weak relationships with environmental variables except for the altitudinal gradient. Community concordance based on Protest was significant at four nested spatial scales, although most cases of community concordances were relatively weak. Fish and macroinvertebrates showed high concordance at the national and catchment scales, whereas macroinvertebrates and diatoms showed high concordance at smaller scales (i.e., mountain or lowland at sub-catchment). Finally, our study demonstrated that community concordance among diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish would be different according to spatial scales and even in the same scales and that use of a representative taxon to assess ecological integrity should be applied with caution.

AB  - Land-use activities and land cover of a watershed influence chemical and physical properties of streams which may impact the biota of the aquatic ecosystem. This study was designed to investigate the impacts of the conversion of forests to urbanized land, including construction and development impacts of land use conversion on water quality and biological integrity of streams. Land use and land cover changes, habitat conditions, water quality, and sediment loadings were studied in eleven subwatersheds of the Reedy River Watershed in the South Carolina Piedmont Ecoregion. Physical and chemical datasets and land use data were used as inputs to build a multivariate model using stepwise multiple regression to predict two instream biological dependant metrics, including Biotic Index, Final Bioclassification, and two biotic metrics that measure richness and species composition. Univariate statistical analysis among 25 environmental variables and biological indices indicated that watersheds of stable land use differed significantly from watersheds undergoing conversion of forest to urban land uses. Significant correlations were observed between land use and particle size distribution, land use and in-stream physical parameters, and land use and in-stream chemical variables. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that the principle environmental factors correlated with biological responses were conductivity, land use, and substrate distribution. Significant correlations between Biotic Index, Final Bioclassification, and compositional measures were found with conductivity, suggesting that conductivity may be a good indicator of land use changes and thus a good predictor of biotic indices in these subwatersheds.

AB  - In South Korea, Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) habitat has increased since the 1990 s because of legal protection, forest development, and increased public awareness. Although otters have been detected throughout the country, a precise investigation of habitat conditions has not previously been undertaken. We hypothesized that higher values of stream health assessment programme (SHAP) indices would indicate better habitat for otters. Otter distribution based on spraint density was investigated along 600 m riverside transects at 250 sites in the Nakdong River basin. We defined four otter population categories (absent, rare, normal, and abundant) and compared the results with presence and absence data. Use of the four population categories provided more details about habitat conditions than presence and absence analysis. The highest spraint densities were found at higher altitudes, and densities declined in areas with high human density and urbanization. The benthic macro invertebrate community index was highly positively related to the otter population indices. In terms of fish as prey items, the proportion of species tolerant to environmental change were negatively related to otter indices, otherwise number of species sensitive to environmental change positively related. Overall, stream health assessment indices provided the highest correlations with otter population numbers and distribution.

AB  - Understanding and managing environmental risk is one of the major challenges of our time. The variability of ecological systems, wherein disturbances occur with uncertain frequency and magnitude over time and space, is essential for maintaining ecosystem integrity and resilience. This paper uses sustainable development indicators to improve multiple-objective environmental decision making under conditions of unknown variability. Specifically, the robustness to uncertainty of competing policy alternatives is assessed using multi-attribute value theory and the recently developed information gap methodology. The management of spruce-budworm outbreaks in the forests of New Brunswick, Canada, is used as an illustrative example. Numerical and theoretical results show how the minimum required return and the available prior information determine which alternative can best cope with environmental uncertainty.

AB  - Restoring the ecological integrity of regulated large rivers necessitates characterizing the natural flow regime. We applied 'Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration' to assess the natural range of variation of the Missouri River's flow regime at 11 locations before (1929-1948) and after (1967-1996) mainstem impoundment. The 3768 km long Missouri River was divided into three sections: upper basin least-altered from flow regulation, including the lower Yellowstone River; middle basin inter-reservoir, and lower basin channelized. Flow regulation was associated with a reduction in magnitude and duration of the annual flood pulse, an increase in magnitude and duration of annual discharge minima, a reduction in frequency of annual low-flow pulses, earlier timing of March-October low-flow pulses, and a general increase in frequency of flow reversals with a reduction in the rate of change in river flows. Hydrologic alterations were smallest at two least-altered upper-basin sites and most frequent and severe in inter-reservoir and upper-channelized river sections. The influence of reservoir operations on depressing the annual flood pulse was partially offset by tributary inflow in the lower 600 km of river. Reservoir operations could be modified to more closely approximate the 1929-1948 flow regime to establish a simulated natural riverine ecosystem. For inter-reservoir and upper channelized-river sections, we recommend periodic controlled flooding through managed reservoir releases during June and July; increased magnitude, frequency and duration of annual high-flow pulses; and increased annual rates of hydrograph rises and falls. All of the regulated Missouri River would benefit from reduced reservoir discharges during August-February, modified timing of reservoir releases and a reduced number of annual hydrograph reversals. Assessment of ecological responses to a reregulation of Missouri River flows that more closely approximates the natural flow regime should then be used in an adaptive fashion to further adjust reservoir operations.

TI  - Forest health assessment in Canada
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Canada's forests cover more than 418 million hectares, 45% of our land area, and represent a diverse range of ecosystems including mixed hardwood stands in southeastern Canada, temperate rain forests of British Columbia and dwarf forests of the arctic tundra. The size and diversity of the forest presents interesting challenges to forest health assessment. The Canadian Forest service (CFS) now recognizes that "forest health" encompasses more than the incidence and distribution of insect pests and disease-causing organisms and that forests are perceived as healthy when ecological processes are maintained and pest populations are operating within natural ranges of variability. Different stakeholders are also seen as having varying definitions of forest "health." For example, the forest industry may focus on health as it relates to timber productivity, whereas environmental advocates may focus on ecological integrity. The assessment and reporting of forest health in Canada is currently being accomplished through cooperation among federal and provincial governments, academia, and industry. An inter agency program is being developed where broad-scale geographic coverage will be linked to national forest inventory plots, current pest conditions monitored by provincial agencies, research on specific disturbance agents carried out regionally, and an overall synthesis of national forest health undertaken by the Canadian Forest Service.

AB  - Ecological restoration of freshwater ecosystems is now being implemented to mitigate anthropogenic disruption. Most emphasis is placed on assessing physico-chemical and hydromorphological properties to monitor restoration progress. However, less is known about the structural integrity and ecosystem health of aquatic ecosystems. In particular, little is known about how ecosystem function changes following river habitat restoration, especially in China. Leaf litter decomposition can be used as an indicator of stream ecosystem integrity. Therefore, the leaf breakdown rate was measured to assess the ecosystem function of restored rivers. By comparing leaf breakdown rates in urban rivers undergoing habitat restoration with that in degraded urban rivers and rivers in forested areas (i.e., reference conditions), we aimed to determine: (i) how habitat restoration affected leaf litter decomposition? (ii) the relationship between leaf litter decomposition to both environmental (habitat and physicochemical variables) and biological factors (benthic communities), and (iii) identify the factors that contribute most to the variance in leaf litter breakdown rates. The results demonstrated a significant increase in leaf breakdown rate (120% in summer and 28% in winter) in the restored rivers compared to the degraded rivers. All environmental and biotic factors evaluated contributed synergistically to the differences in leaf litter decomposition among the three river types. The role of macroinvertebrates, mainly shredders, appeared to be particularly important, contributing 52% (summer) and 33% (winter) to the variance in decomposition, followed by habitat characteristics (e.g. substrate diversity, water velocity; 17% in summer, 29% in winter), physico-chemical variables (e.g. nutrient and organic pollutants; 11% in summer, 1% in winter) and biofilm bacteria (0% in summer, 15% in winter). Habitat restoration positively affected the structure and function of the previously degraded streams. Knowledge on controlling variables and their attribution to changes of ecosystem functioning provides guidance to assist the future planning of ecological restoration strategies.

AB  - This research aimed to assess vegetation composition and the indicator species around water source areas of pine forest plantation. Data were collected through interview and vegetation survey. Vegetation communities were first compared using multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) analysis. Indicator species analysis was then employed to determine the indicator species for each condition by considering historical data from the interview. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and simple correlation analysis were also included. The result showed significant differences in species composition between water source areas in Watujali (lower low flow) and Silengkong (higher low flow) catchments, indicated by T = -5.104, p = 0.000. Pinus merkusii was dominant in Watujali (important value = 78%, D' = 0.62) compared to Silengkong (important value = 41%, D' = 0.21), and in becoming an indicator species (value = 52.1, p = 0.042) for Watujali. Meanwhile, Laportea sinuata, as the specific tree of water source areas, was an indicator for Silengkong (value = 29.4, p = 0.004). At a smaller level, indicator species differentiated the two catchments, even though they shared similar in D' and H'. Among specific plants of water source areas, only Ficus septica was an indicator for Watujali (value = 29.4, p = 0.004), given its adaptability. Specific plants of water source areas, including Laportea sinuata, Coctus spicatus, and Calocassia gigantea, were significant indicators for Silengkong catchments, illustrated by 34.6, 35.9, and 33.0 of indicator values, respectively. These results also reflected the relationship among tree vegetation change, environmental features, and the growth of smaller species, as implied by both CCA and simple correlation. This finding could be used as basic information for early assessment of environmental change and environmental restoration efforts around water source areas on pine forest plantations. Repetition of this study is suggested to be carried out in other pine forest areas, as each region sometimes has its own specific native and natural species.

AB  - Classic studies have successfully linked single-species abundances, life-history traits, assemblage structures and biomass of carabid beetles to past and present, human-caused environmental impacts and variation in 'natural' conditions. This evidence has led many to suggest carabids to function as 'indicators' - a term that bears multiple meanings. Here, a conservation-oriented definition for an indicator is used, carabid indicator potential from seven views is evaluated, and ways to proceed in indicator research are discussed. (1) Carabid species richness poorly indicates the richness and abundance of other taxa, which underlines the importance of using multiple taxa in environmental assessments. The ability of assemblage indices and specialist or functional-group abundances to reflect rare species and habitats should be examined in detail. (2) Experimental evidence suggests that carabids may potentially serve as keystone indicators. (3) Carabids are sensitive to human-altered abiotic conditions, such as pesticide use in agro-ecosystems and heavy metal contamination of soils. Carabids might thus reflect ecological sustainability and 'ecosystem health'. (4) Carabid assemblages host abundant species characteristic of particular habitat types or successional stages, which makes them promising dominance indicators. (5) Carabids reflect variation in 'natural' conditions, but vegetation and structural features are more commonly adopted as condition indicators. Carabids nevertheless provide yet another, equally accurate, view on the structure of the environment. (6) Carabids may function as early-warning signalers, as suggested by recent studies linking climate and carabid distributions. (7) Carabids reflect natural and human-caused disturbances and management, but the usefulness of these responses for conservation purposes requires further research. In summary, European carabids appear useful model organisms and possibly indicators because they are diverse, taxonomically and ecologically well-known, efficiently reflect biotic and abiotic conditions, are relevant at multiple spatial scales, and are easy to collect in sufficiently large numbers to allow statistical analyses. The assumption that carabid responses would reflect rare environmental conditions or the responses of rare and threatened species - crucial information for conservationists and managers - has not yet been critically evaluated. Even if it holds, the usefulness will be context dependent: species and their populations vary, conditions vary, questions put forward vary, and assessment goals vary.

AB  - Anthropogenic and natural changes are threatening pond ecological integrity in Patagonia and tools for bioassessment are required. Macrophytes are good candidates to determine the conservation status of ponds; nevertheless, metric selection procedures should be founded on an adequate knowledge of plant ecological responses. We assessed the main environmental constraints driving variation in macrophyte assemblages, and trophic status at 29 ponds located at the continental and insular Patagonia region. We screened 20 potential macrophyte metrics as indicators of pond condition that included origin (native, endemic, exotic), lifeforms (annual/biannual, perennial), functional groups (submersed, emergent, floating-leaved, landforms), and community attributes. A set of 106 taxa were recorded, and richness per site (10 species) was unexpectedly high for a cold temperate area, reinforcing the value of isolated ponds as habitat for macrophytes in the Patagonian landscape. Natives dominated most assemblages; exotics were present at 24 ponds, contributing with high cover (>45%) at 15% of them. Macrophyte assemblages were driven by natural factors over anthropogenic ones, with temperature, rainfall, pH, conductivity and nutrients explaining most variation in patterns. However, pond eutrophication symptoms (high phosphorous concentration and chlorophyll a) were associated with extensive cattle grazing (manure and trampling) and urbanization (runoff). Generalized linear models captured natural variables (temperature, alkalinity) as most powerful explaining richness measures. Models also indicated that both richness of emergent and endemics were negatively affected by total phosphorous increases. Land cover factors: grasses/herbaceous, mallin and trees (%) in 100 m buffer around ponds appeared as additional ecological drivers of macrophyte patterns, particularly of submersed (>50%) and native richness (36%). Natural and anthropogenic gradients were overlapped, making it difficult to generalize our conclusions. Further studies are needed to test the performance of the macrophyte metrics selected here, which are a vital tool for the conservation of the most austral ponds in South America.

AB  - The research aimed to link the concepts of ecological integrity and ecosystem services in mangroves, in search of food security and greater resilience to climate change. It was carried out in two coastal areas in the southwest of the province of Pinar del Rio, Cuba; namely, Protected Area of Managed Resources Punta Cortes and Coloma-Las Canas (one in a state of deterioration). A methodological proposal was developed that relates the concepts of ecological integrity, ecosystem services and food security in coastal areas with the presence of mangroves, for which indicators are taken into account to assess the ecosystems in question and compare results through the application of surveys and interviews with residents, as empirical methods of support. In the case of Punta Cortes, according to the indicator range, a score of 28 was obtained, which places the area as high integrity, but not in the case of La Coloma-Las Canas, whose score was 11, remaining, according to the methodology, in the low integrity range. The results of the surveys carried out among the residents coincide with the previous ones, concluding that the La Coloma-Las Canas sector does not have the necessary food security for the local development of its residents due to the deterioration of its mangroves, which threatens the scarce possibility of resilience to climatic changes, especially hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as sea level rise.

AB  - Although the importance of aboriginal knowledge, values, and perspectives in sustainable development has been recognised for many decades, worldwide examples exist showing that aboriginal involvement is less then effective. How and where to include aboriginal needs and goals has however been problematic. Ultimately, aboriginal forest values need to be considered with scientific strategies and their role and compatibility with forest conditions needs to be explored. Criteria and indicator (C&I) frameworks can be used as a platform to include community needs and goals in management decisions. This review compares aboriginal forest ecological perspectives defined by Canadian local level C&I frameworks with non-aboriginal local level C&I frameworks to identify their differences at the indicator level. Three major themes mark the differences between aboriginal and non-aboriginal indicators: (1) aboriginal frameworks introduce ecological indicators of cultural importance; (2) there is an aesthetic concern for forest operations especially if they affect cultural owners; and (3) indicators regarding the access to resources are more complex and include the sustainability of the productivity, proximity, integrity and quality of resources used in traditional activities. Results show that First Nation forest sustainability issues are in effect a combination of forest conditions and values. Inclusion of forest values in C&I frameworks is necessary because: (1) aboriginal communities do not dissociate culture from the environment and thus forest values from forest condition, (2) they have an impact on resulting forest management strategies and decisions, and (3) they offer a holistic approach to sustainability issues and a better picture of local environmental contexts.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Over the last few years, several of the world's national park networks have implemented ecological integrity monitoring programs. These programs are based on a series of indicators to detect changes in ecosystem integrity. There are many scientific and logistical challenges in developing these programs due to limits in both our knowledge of ecosystems functioning and the resources for implementing such programs. Thus, the relatively quick and simple implementation of many monitoring programs has been to the detriment of their scientific validity. Few studies have focused on evaluating an entire monitoring program. This project presents an approach to evaluate the ecological and statistical relevance of ecosystem integrity indicators measured within a program with the goal of iterative optimization. The approach is based on three complementary elements: (1) spatial characterization of park ecosystems based on the classification of satellite imagery, (2) ecological validation of indicators based on ecosystem conceptual models and (3) statistical validation of indicators based on analyses of statistical power. This innovative approach allows a systematic, quantified, reproducible and generalizable review of the indicators of an ecological integrity monitoring program. It provides managers with an overview of the spatial representativeness of indicators, their ecological and statistical relevance according to different parameters such as the period monitored, the amount of change to be detected, and the degree of significance. Thus, the approach identifies monitoring gaps and offers various alternatives for improving sampling. The approach was developed and tested in the network of Quebec national parks, more specifically in the Frontenac, Jacques-Cartier and Bic national parks. The results clearly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current program in place and possible improvements are proposed for these parks. This approach is a relevant tool for park networks, particularly for those that have limited resources for monitoring ecological integrity.

AB  - The excessive changes of downhole pressure and temperature during injection/fracturing could initiate micro-annulus of cement sheath as the leakage pathway of underground fluid, which increases the risk of suspending production and environmental pollution. The investigations on accurate prediction, operational management and new technologies are significant to sustain well integrity and to enhance safety and efficiency in hydrocarbon and geothermal developments. In this work, a novel fully coupled thermal-stress model is proposed, which can predict the micro-annulus initiation and extension in the casing-cement-formation system. The interfaces of cement sheath with casing/formation are simulated using the contact interaction containing cohesive behavior and damage. The surface film condition is set on the internal wall of casing to simulate the heat transfer due to cold-water flow. This model is validated by the laboratory experiment and shows high accuracy. Results indicate that the maximum micro-annulus occurs during depressurization process after injection. It is newly found that the debonding could also emerge at the beginning of cold-water circulation in casing. The thermal effect, compared with pressure, is the dominated factor on micro-annulus initiation and size, while the pressure only causes a small plastic micro-annulus. For countermeasures, enhancing tensile strength is not an effective approach to prevent micro-annulus. By appropriately assigning the injection procedure, the micro-annulus can be eliminated in injection/fracturing operations. The findings can supply the technique support for well integrity assessment and management during hydraulic fracturing or high-pressure injection and production.

AB  - Wetland assessments in South Africa continue to be undertaken at the scale of individual wetlands, while ultimately a landscape assessment is required for broader regional planning. The aim of this research was to develop probability models of degradation per wetland type using landscape-scale predictor variables. Condition data for a total of 463 seep, floodplain and valley bottom (channelled and unchannelled) hydrogeomorphic (HGM) units was combined with data for 21 potential explanatory variables for land cover, infrastructure and catchment physiography. Multiple logistic regression models to estimate the probability of degradation per HGM type were investigated at three different spatial levels (1,000 m buffer radius; 100 and 1,000 km(2) scales). Models at the intermediate scale were most useful and only these are reported. Percent natural vegetation, road density, population density and altitude, together with anthropogenic land use (cultivation and forestry plantation area) were important predictors of wetland condition, and differed per HGM type. Regional patterns of degradation within quaternary catchments in KwaZulu-Natal were dissimilar for each HGM type. There is potential to refine and extend the models for application at a national level, and to predict actual condition scores using ordinal logistic regression based on larger datasets.

AB  - Indicator species have been used successfully for estimating ecosystem integrity, but comparative studies for defining optimal taxonomic group remain scarce. Furthermore, species combinations may constitute more integrative tools than single species indicators, but case studies are needed to test their efficiency. We used Indicator Species Analysis, which statistically determines the association of species to one or several groups of sites, to obtain indicators of ecosystem recovery after various deer density reductions. We used five taxonomic groups: plants, carabid beetles, bees, moths and songbirds. To test whether species combinations could complement single indicator species, we used plants as a model taxon and examined the indicator value of joint occurrence of two or three plant species. Our study relies on experimental controlled browsing enclosures established for six years on Anticosti Island (Quebec). Four levels of deer density (0, 7.5 and 15 deer km(-2) and natural densities between 27 and 56 deer km-2) were studied in two vegetation cover types (uncut forests and cut-over areas), in a full factorial design for a total of eight experimental treatments. For all taxa but bees, we tested 54 treatment groups consisting in one specific density or in a sequence of two or more consecutive deer densities in one or both cover types (ten groups for bees, sampled only in cut-over areas). We found 12 plants, 11 moths and one songbird to be single species indicators of ecosystem conditions obtained under 12 different treatment groups. Six treatment groups were indicated by plants and six different ones by moths, of which one group was also identified by a songbird species. Moths were thus worth the extra sampling effort, especially since the groups they indicated were more treatment-specific (mainly one or two deer density treatments). We tested the same 54 treatment groups for plant species combinations represented by two or three co-occurring species. Plant combinations efficiently complemented plant singletons for detecting ecosystem conditions obtained under various deer densities. In fact, although singletons were highly predictive, 17 additional treatment groups were identified exclusively with two- and three-species combinations, some being more treatment-specific. Our findings show that plants and moths provide complementary indicators of ecosystem conditions under various deer densities, and that computing species combinations increases our capacity to monitor ecosystem recovery after reducing herbivore densities.

AB  - Arboreal lichens have a wide range of tolerance to habitat disturbance. As a result, they have been used globally as bioindicators of environmental change, particularly for monitoring atmospheric pollution. Here, we use lichens to monitor air quality and ecological integrity (EI) at Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site in Nova Scotia, Canada. We provide descriptions of two protocols and compare the results using data gathered in 2006, 2011, and 2016. To monitor air quality, we established 12 monitoring sites throughout the park and used a suite of lichens that are intolerant to air pollution to develop an index of air purity (IAP) that we compared every 5 years. Our protocol for monitoring EI of forest ecosystems was set up at these same 12 sites. We selected 50 regionally common field-identifiable lichen species and genera ranging in sensitivity from disturbance-tolerant to intolerant, and compare their presence in spatially constrained zones on a variety of tree species every 5 years. Our results suggest that air quality in Kejimkujik has increased slightly in the 10 years since monitoring was implemented, which is consistent with improvements in local air quality. Species richness also increased slightly, suggesting that EI has not declined. The maintenance of EI, through protection and restoration of natural resources, is a key priority in the management of national parks in Canada. Our protocols will provide early detection of changes to EI, enabling park managers to take responsive action. We are confident that our protocols can be replicated in other parts of the world with different suites of regionally common lichens.

AB  - Among the main effects of human activities on the environment are land use and resulting land cover changes. Such changes impact the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human society. This supply of multiple goods and services by nature should match the demands of the society, if self-sustaining human-environmental systems and a sustainable utilization of natural capital are to be achieved. To describe respective states and dynamics, appropriate indicators and data for their quantification, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, are needed. By linking land cover information from, e.g. remote sensing, land survey and GIS with data from monitoring, statistics, modeling or interviews, ecosystem service supply and demand can be assessed and transferred to different spatial and temporal scales. The results reveal patterns of human activities over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide ecosystem services under changing land use. Also the locations of respective demands for these services can be determined. As maps are powerful tools, they hold high potentials for visualization of complex phenomena. We present an easy-to-apply concept based on a matrix linking spatially explicit biophysical landscape units to ecological integrity, ecosystem service supply and demand. An exemplary application for energy supply and demand in a central German case study region and respective maps for the years 1990 and 2007 are presented. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service supply and demand is elaborated and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this, collected data must, through a systematic framework, be linked to measurable management objectives. This paper demonstrates how the results obtained with biological indices and system-specific knowledge, are combined to derive semiquantitative assessments of ecosystem condition. These assessments provide the basis for responding to the results of a river monitoring programme. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for quick identification of priority areas for biodiversity protection makes rapid assessment methods important management tools for defining conservation strategies. An increasingly used rapid assessment method is rapid ecological assessment (REA), a fast and flexible survey directed toward selected indicator species and vegetation forms. The purpose of this study was to propose and test REA based on plant community features of the semideciduous Atlantic forest (SAF). Correlation tests were performed between data collected by REA and plant species diversity, richness, and abundance collected by conventional woody plant inventory methods. The study was conducted in 21 SAF patches in Northern Parana State, Brazil. The phytosociological inventory was conducted along a single transect and required 2 days to complete (excluding time spent for herbarium identification), whereas REA was conducted along three to four transects per working day. REA results correlated positively with woody plant diversity, proving REA to be an efficient method for defining the conservation status of SAF fragments, but accuracy of evaluations of threats to biological integrity are relatively low. Both the selection of appropriate variables and the skill level of field staff are critical and can strongly influence REA results.

AB  - Determining thresholds of species loss in response to gradients of human impact is becoming an increasingly important component of stream conservation and management. We analyzed the thresholds of change in populations and communities of the infraorder Nepomorpha along a gradient of environmental integrity in streams of the Brazilian savannah, based on samples from 20 sites. We used the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to identify the location and magnitude of changes associated with the environmental quality and the frequency and abundance of the different taxa. We also used TITAN to calculate the positive and negative thresholds of the community and species along the habitat integrity gradient. Nepomorphan species were generally associated with sites of higher environmental quality, which presented larger populations and greater species richness. Only a few nepomorphan species groups were associated with impacted streams. Thresholds were evident in some aquatic nepomorphan populations, but not for the community as a whole. This indicates that species have idiosyncratic responses to the environmental gradient, but in general nepomorphans appear to be a good indicator of healthy environments or less impacted streams in the Brazilian savannah.

AB  - Lake health assessment (LHA), a powerful tool for lake ecological protection, provides the foundation for sustainable water environment management. However, existing methods have not yet considered the effects of fuzziness and randomness on LHA. In addition, most of the current studies on LHA focus on the plain areas, lack of quantitative studies in mountain areas, such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Pythagorean fuzzy cloud (PFC) integration algorithm drawing on the advantages of Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS) and cloud model was proposed. A novel hybrid decision-making framework combining PFC integration algorithm and TOPSIS model was developed to determine the lake health levels with fuzziness and randomness. An indicator system incorporating ecosystem integrity (physical habitat, water quantity and quality, aquatic life) and non-ecological performance (social services) was established. To comprehensively investigate the lake health level in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Nam Co was selected as study area. Our results confirm that the developed framework in this study can overcome the shortcomings of existing methods and provide a more effective approach for LHA with fuzziness and randomness. In Nam Co, the non-ecological performance was sig-nificantly better than the ecosystem integrity. Health levels exhibited a remarkable spatial variation influenced by tourism and grazing, with decreasing health status from the northwestern to southeastern Nam Co. Approximately 85% of the sampling sites were at excellent or healthy levels, 15% were subhealthy, and no sampling sites were un-healthy and sick. Our results highlight that tourism has affected health levels at Nam Co, and effective measures are needed to minimize the impact in ecological fragile areas.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to first present different approaches used for developing diatom-based indices and second, to evaluate the ecological integrity of eastern Canadian streams (Quebec) using these different approaches. Six indices from Europe (TDI, IPS, IBD, SLA) and North America (IBI, IDEC) were employed. The results from this study confirmed that, as a general trend, most of the common riverine taxa have similar ecological preferences throughout Europe and North America. The comparison of the six diatom-based indices illustrated the similarity of results and robustness of diatom-based monitoring no matter what indices were used. All indices effectively scored river health across most of the environmental gradient, although variations in scores were observed at both tails of the integrity spectrum with the greatest range in index scores at the heavily impacted end of the gradient. The use of sub-indices to account for ecoregion characteristics and natural pH variations improves regional index performance, especially at the extremes (i.e. in reference and heavily impacted rivers). Regionally derived indices are more sensitive and preferred although we recognize the utility of using larger gradient indices excluding ecoregion or geological considerations for broader national and international applications.

AB  - Agricultural practices affect the integrity of riparian areas of small streams. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the increase of agricultural activities influences negatively the functional conditions of the low order streams in the Atlantic forest of southern Brazil. Litter bags with leaves of Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez were located in eight streams with different amounts of woody vegetation and agriculture land uses in their riparian zones. After 7, 15 and 30 days, the litter bags were removed for identification of associated invertebrates and determination of decomposition rate. Decomposition rates were negatively influenced by agriculture in the riparian zone while primary production was positively influenced. On the other hand, the decomposition mediated by microorganisms did not vary along the degradation gradient. The abundance of collectors increased in streams adjacent to agricultural land while the abundance of shredders was decreased. Our results showed that algae biomass and leaf decomposition were sensitive to the replacement of native vegetation by agricultural use. However, the trophic structure of invertebrates was moderately sensitive to agricultural land use.

AB  - The biodiversity of macrozooplankton and physicochemical indices at eight sites in the Wenyuhe River Basin were analyzed from April 2010 to March 2011 to assess the water quality following construction of a wetland (CW). The association between biodiversity and physicochemical parameters was analyzed using a self-organizing map (SOM). The water quality in the upstream portion of the CW showed no overall improvement during this period based on biodiversity (H') and physicochemical assessment (Pb/n). Both assessments indicated that the water quality in upstream of CW was partially improved and showed an evident time dependent relationship after CW. Although a sample site, which received water from two streams, showed higher biodiversity in an integrative manner, the physicochemical assessments were more heavily influenced by treated water from the Qinghe Sewage Treatment Plant, rather than upstream at the other river basin. This was a noteworthy demonstration that physicochemical and biological assessments were not in accord and addressed the separate functioning of river ecosystems under field conditions. Physicochemical assessment may represent water quality more conservatively with respect to drinking water maintenance than biodiversity assessment. Nitrogen pollution was the main cause for the decrease in physicochemical conditions. Overall, the results indicated that the association between biodiversity and physicochemical assessments determined from the SOM could reveal aquatic ecosystem quality in a comprehensive manner and therefore be a useful tool for defining water quality and ecological integrity in aquatic ecosystem management, especially for complex water environments.

AB  - The effects of various aquatic habitats on the abundance, species richness, diversity and taxonomic distinctness of Odonata were studied. The impact of environmental factors and living conditions in lentic habitats were expressed by the composition of coenoses, on the evaluation we used the Dragonfly Biotic Index. The positive effects of habitat heterogeneity on biodiversity are well known, but it is not clear how the diversity of studied and ecologically important taxa, such as odonates, may vary in different water reservoirs. We investigated how Odonata community metrics (composition, abundance, diversity and environmental compatibility) differ in lentic water: ponds, fishponds, excavation of mineral material and in marshlands, where biodiversity plays an important role. Using an entomological mesh, we took samples in the south-western part of Slovakia in six geo-morphological units at 54 study sites during four years. This study detected distinct odonates assemblage variations among habitats and heterogeneity among gradients. Wide ranges of microhabitats with different environmental properties create appropriate conditions for living span of them. Surprisingly, the highest species richness was recorded in the excavation of mineral materials habitats. Stagnicolous Odonata species correlated (CCA) with the habitats of excavation of mineral material and marshlands; showed links to the littoral vegetation and dense vegetation cover. While the euryecious species have been linked to the ponds and fishponds; and correlated with the water body size. It seems to be degraded habitats are not so much suitable for rare and endangered species, but to preserve the biological value of the environment and for the existence of the high abundance and species richness of odonates.

AB  - The distribution of biota in aquatic ecosystems, including aquifers, is collectively influenced by habitat structure, water quality, seasonality, and local variations in environmental conditions. However, little is known about the nature and relative influences of such factors in groundwater ecosystems. Our aims were to identify the key environmental variables influencing the distribution of biota within the Gwydir River alluvial aquifer in northwestern New South Wales, Australia, and to consider the relative importance of environmental variables, in terms of habitat structure, water quality, seasonality, and site attributes, to both microbial and invertebrate (stygofauna) assemblages. Stygofauna distribution was primarily influenced by habitat variables (predominantly sediment structure) followed by site variables (abundance of trees), with water quality and seasonality having relatively little influence. These results indicate that it is the aquifer conditions relating to habitat structure, water flow, and the supply of organic matter that are most important for determining stygofauna distribution. Microbial assemblage structure was not strongly correlated with habitat variables, possibly because habitat restraints do not exist because of their smaller size. Instead, seasonality and water-quality variables had the greatest influence on microbial assemblages. Microbes might respond to seasonal (particularly rainfall induced) changes in water quality more quickly than do stygofauna, which may explain the relatively greater importance of seasonality and water quality to microbial assemblages. Given that stygofauna are most influenced by habitat and site variables, and microbial assemblages are most influenced by seasonality and water quality, disturbance to any of these factors may threaten the stability and integrity of the groundwater ecosystem.

AB  - Vibrio spp. cause frank and opportunistic infections of humans through exposure to seafood and seawater. Due to their natural occurrence in coastal environments, traditional indicator organisms, such as E. coli, do not predict their presence. This problem has complicated public health initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of illnesses from Vibrio spp. In the U.S., V vulnificus has received extensive study due to the severity of its disease in humans. Its numbers increase with warmer summer temperature, and decline to nondetectable levels in colder winter months. In environments with salinities greater than 20 ppt, V. vulnificus numbers decline to levels that do not pose human health risks. A similar response to temperature has been observed for pathogenic strains of V parahaemolyticus, where recent outbreaks of illness have been associated with El Nino weather conditions. In addition, temperature-induced plankton blooms have been linked to epidemic cholera in certain geographical regions of the world. New research shows that seawater temperature and salinity can be used to develop mathematical models of V. vulnificus incidence in coastal environments. Similar efforts might be extended to other Vibrio spp. to develop indicators that predict human health risk, as well as ecosystem integrity.

AB  - With an increasing proportion of natural forests being replaced by plantations, there is a need to determine their potential to fulfill ecological purposes other than wood production. This study evaluated the extent to which deciduous and coniferous plantations develop understory attributes comparable to those of naturally regenerated stands. A functional group approach was used to synthesise species responses in terms of their ecological traits. Multivariate analyses of ecological traits revealed 16 emergent groups that shared common traits associated with a similar life history strategy. Responses of these groups, understory structure, and understory environmental conditions to plantation types and stand stages were analyzed and compared to naturally regenerated stands. Clear associations of trait responses to stand developmental stages and plantation types emerged. Light-demanding and wind-dispersed species groups were associated with early-successional stages, while woody groups, ferns and ant-dispersed spring-flowering herbs were associated with late-successional stages. Analyses also revealed an indicator group associated with old naturally regenerated forest. The understory functional groups and environmental conditions of deciduous plantations converged toward those of old naturally regenerated forests. However, understory structure in deciduous plantations remained poorly developed and richness of the indicator group was low compared to unplanted stands. Conifer plantations, currently the most common plantation type in the northern hardwood biome, showed a completely different pathway of understory development. Modifications to current plantation management practices are proposed to help recreate or maintain natural understory biological and physical attributes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The New York-New Jersey Highlands, a 600,000 ha area of forested uplands, provide vital environmental services to the growing New York City, USA metropolitan region. Urban development and associated land use/land cover change threaten to impair the Highland's natural resource values. In response, the USDA Forest Service, in collaboration with Rutgers University, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Regional Plan Association, undertook a regional study of the NY-NJ Highlands to characterize the resources at stake and assess the implications of continued land use change. This paper will focus on the Highlands as a case study on the application of landscape-scale indicators to assess the potential impacts of future land use change. A three-pronged approach was adopted: (1) land use/land cover change mapping to assess past changes, (2) build-out modeling to project possible future land use change, and (3) landscape-scale indicators of forest and watershed condition. The coupled build-out and landscape indicator analysis served as a planning tool to assess the potential impacts to forest and watershed integrity based on two different scenarios of future development.

AB  - Differences in the raw data used in bioassessments and choices regarding how those data are analyzed and summarized can affect inferences regarding the status of ecological resources and, thus, the degree to which we can trust individual ecological assessments, compare assessments across different programs and regions, or share data when developing or refining new endpoint indices. Progress in addressing these issues has been hindered by lack of consensus regarding what a general definition of comparability should be in the context of bioassessments and what measures of comparability are appropriate for ecological data. In this paper, we review the state of knowledge regarding the comparability of assessments as affected by differences in raw data (composition and relative abundance of taxa), derived measures (biotic metrics and endpoint indices), and assessment levels (condition classes). We specifically address the extent to which the comparability of assessments can be compromised by systematic differences in data, discuss the factors known to affect data comparability, and consider the techniques available to evaluate and improve comparability. Rigorous assessment of data comparability should be a standard aspect of quality assurance when developing and applying biological indices.

AB  - Setting endpoints and targets in forest restoration is a complicated task that is best accomplished in cooperative partnerships that account for the ecology of the system, production of desired ecosystem goods and services, economics and well-being of society, and future environments. Clearly described and quantitative endpoints and intermediary targets are needed to manage restoration of ecosystem structure, composition, function, and production. Selecting indicators of key ecosystem attributes that are linked to endpoint and target condition, function, sustainability, health, integrity, resilience, and production is important to monitoring restoration success. Indicators are used to track ecosystem trajectory, assess progress toward achieving endpoints and targets, adapt management, and communicate with external publics. Reference sites can be used to help set endpoints and targets with caution. Other science-based ecosystem models or management tools are available to help quantify intermediate targets and endpoints. Continued work to better understand historic ecosystem conditions is fundamental to assessing change, extent of damage, and restoration potential. A hierarchy of forest plans from regional and landscape to site specific are useful for defining endpoints, targets, and indicators at appropriate ecological scales; and to consider populations, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic factors that operate at a variety of scales.

AB  - Organisms display sets of functional attributes that reflect local environmental conditions and can be used in environmental quality assessments. We analyzed the functional attributes of Chironomidae in reservoirs in the Brazilian semiarid region with different levels of anthropic disturbances. We examined the relationships of functional feeding groups, feeding strategies, body size, and the morphological adaptations of chironomid larvae with the environmental quality of 94 sites. The sites were classified according to their levels of anthropic disturbance based on environmental characteristics. To observe the relationship between the functional attributes of Chironomidae and the different levels of anthropic disturbance, we performed an RLQ. To test differences between the functional categories of Chironomidae, we use an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The functional categories of Chironomidae that indicated anthropic disturbances were: collector group, reduced pseudopods, abdominal tubule, and gatherers. The least disturbed sites showed higher relative abundances of engulfers, predators, organisms with elongated heads, and small body size. The observed relationships between Chironomid functional attributes and the levels of anthropic impacts on reservoirs in the semiarid region of Brazil allow their use as a tool for assessing the environmental qualities of lentic aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Agricultural practices such as livestock grazing and tilling can result in soil erosion and runoff of fine sediments, nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and pesticides, leading to degradation of aquatic environments. Urbanization is also responsible for a variety of impacts on fluvial ecosystems, including pollution by heavy metals, oil, domestic sewage and garbage. In this study, we evaluate the impact of land use on stream health of the Uberabinha river catchment. Overall, rural streams presented better ecological conditions than urban streams. Both species composition and abundance of benthic communities showed significant differences between rural and urban streams. Urban streams presented a higher dominance of Oligochaeta, Hirudinea and Gastropoda, bioindicators of poor water quality. Rural streams presented significantly greater richness and diversity. Compared to urban streams, rural streams presented a significantly higher number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata and Hemiptera taxa. Our analyses also showed congruence (high correlation) among the classical biodiversity metrics (Shannon-Wiener index - H', Pielou's measure of eveness - J) and monitoring parameters (% Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera - EPT, Biological Monitoring Work Party - BMWP, bioindicator approach and Rapid Assessment Protocol - RAP, a habitatbased approach). Five from seven rural streams presented good water quality according to both BMWP and RAP and none of the urban streams presented good water quality. Our results show that the urban streams of Uberlandia municipality are poor ecosystems, and require improved management actions by environmental authorities. We also encourage that the riparian forest restoration and management carried out in the upper portion of Uberabinha River catchment to be extended to the urban area of the municipality.

AB  - Assessing accomplishment of management objectives related to ecosystem health requires monitoring key indicators, including ecological processes and components of biological diversity. For these purposes, a monitoring plan was developed on the Chequamegon National Forest. It was refined by use of public workshops and technical consultation, and later adjusted based on practicality and additional inventory needs. To date, monitoring has focused on plants and birds, including long-term baseline monitoring in both managed forest and more natural areas. Monitoring is done at both the national forest and the ranger district levels, a forest subunit, the latter usually focusing on specific projects rather than forest-wide ecosystem health concerns. Examples from the Laurentian ranger district of the Superior National Forest are provided. Future assessments will require qualitative, quantitative and spatial analyses of community, ecosystem, habitat and population trends and patterns, and management effects. An institutionalized program that focuses on key ecosystem components at various scales, and that involves concerned publics and many partners: will be necessary to provide feedback to refine forest management.

AB  - Urbanization induces detrimental effects on the eco-environment that are beginning to be extensively described. However, the adoption of suitable indicators and reliable methods still requires attention to provide a basis for a more accurate understanding of eco-environmental effects from urbanization. The aggregated index system representing the coupling relationships between urbanization and eco-environment was introduced and an integrated sustainable development approach (ISD) to simulate and evaluate the integrative effects was developed in this paper. The ISD consists of modules of the coupling relationship assessments, systematic analysis of potential eco-environmental changes, and sustainability evaluation. An interpretative structural modeling (ISM) and grey relative technique (GRT) are used to analyze the systematical structure and assess the coupling relationships. A system dynamics model (SD) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used to simulate the potential environmental changes and compare the sustainability, respectively. An application study of Jiangsu province in China was performed, where the general eco-environmental integrity is under significant urbanization pressure. The potential eco-environmental scenarios from 2010 to 2015 under natural, populated, economic, spatial and social urbanization patterns were simulated and analyzed. The result reveals that the urbanization sustainability may be met on condition that either populated urbanization or social urbanization pattern is adopted in Jiangsu province, China. The aggregated indexes and ISD may help local authorities better understand and address the complex coupling relationship, and develop improved regional environmental management strategies that better balance urbanization and eco-environmental conservation.

AB  - The paper presents a methodological framework for quantifying soil ecosystem health with special focus on chemical stressors and ecological integrity as determinant for biological productivity of soil ecosystems. Ecological risk assessment is needed to facilitate the assessment of soil health and the capability of a soil to provide ecosystem services such as e.g. detoxification and decomposition of wastes, soil formation and renewal of soil fertility. We have developed such an approach that is based on systematic enumeration of vulnerable indicators that reflect essential soil ecosystem structures and processes that underlay such soil ecosystem services. The method is illustrated fora shortlist of common chemical stressors, represented by nickel, cadmium, chlorpyriphos, lindane and diazinon, and applied in a comparative assessment of suitability for use of grassland on contaminated soil. A comprehensive and relevant set of ecological integrity indicators has been analysed to derive a smaller core set of indicators highly relevant for all types of grassland use: i.e. reflecting ecological requirements to be fulfilled for any sustainable use of grassland.

AB  - We introduce a new method for quantifying the ecological condition (C) of sites based on documented species' responses to environmental stress. Preliminary research is needed to establish species-specific logistic functions, representing probabilities of finding individual species across an explicit reference gradient, ranging from maximally stressed (C = 0) to minimally stressed (C = 10) localities. Each function takes into account the species' tolerance to stress, the species' overall ubiquity, and the probability of detecting the species when it is present. Given a set of standardized species-specific functions, the ecological condition of any site can be derived by iteration, converging on the value of C that best "predicts" the species that are actually present. Species from multiple taxonomic groups can be included in the calculations, and results are not directly affected by species richness or sampling area. We demonstrate a successful application of this method for bird species assemblages in the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes coastal zone. Approximately, 28% of the bird species observed in the Eastern Deciduous Forest Ecological Province and 35% of the species in the Laurentian Mixed Forest Ecological Province showed strong relationships with a reference gradient of land cover variables. Functional stress-response relationships of these species can be used effectively to estimate ecological condition at new sites. The estimated condition based on bird species generally mirrors the reference condition, but deviations from the expected 1: 1 relationship provide meaningful insights about ecological condition of the target areas. Sensitivity analysis using different numbers of species shows that our method is robust and can be applied consistently with 25-30 species exhibiting strong stress-response functions.

AB  - Commonly affected by changes in climate and environmental conditions, coastal areas are very dynamic environments where shellfish play an important ecological role. In this study, the oxidative stress and genotoxic responses of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed to paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) - producing dinoflagellates Gymnodinium catenatum were evaluated under i) current conditions (CC: 19 degrees C; pH 8.0), warming (W: 24 degrees C; pH 8.0), acidification (A:19 degrees C; pH 7.6) and iv) combined effect of warming and acidification (WA: 24 degrees C; pH 7.6). Mussels were fed with G. catenatum for 5 days, and to a non-toxic diet during the following 10 days. A battery of oxidative stress biomarkers and comet assay was performed at the peak of toxin accumulation and at the end of the post-exposure phase. Under CC, gills and hepatopancreas displayed different responses/vulnerabilities and mechanisms to cope with PST. While gills presented a tendency for lipid peroxidation (LPO) and genetic damage (expressed by the Genetic Damage Indicator - GDI), hepatopancreas seems to better cope with the toxins, as no LPO was observed. However, the mechanisms involved in hepatopancreas protection were not enough to maintain DNA integrity. The absence of LPO, and the antioxidant system low responsiveness, suggests DNA damage was not oxidative. When exposed to toxic algae under W, toxin-modulated antioxidant responses were observed in both gills and hepatopancreas. Simultaneous exposure to the stressors highlighted gills susceptibility with a synergistic interaction increasing DNA damage. Exposure to toxic algae under A led to genotoxicity potentiation in both organs. The combined effect of WA did not cause relevant interactions in gills antioxidant responses, but stressors interactions impacted LPO and GDI. Antioxidant responses and LPO pointed out to be modulated by the environmental conditions in hepatopancreas, while GDI results support the dominance of toxin-triggered process. Overall, these results reveal that simultaneous exposure to warming, acidification and PSTs impairs mussel DNA integrity, compromising the genetic information due to the synergetic effects. Finally, this study highlights the increasing ecological risk of harmful algal blooms to Mytilus ganoprovincianis populations.

AB  - Biological indicators are useful tools for the assessment of ecosystem condition. Multi-metric and multitaxa indicators may respond to a broader range of disturbances than simpler indicators, but their complexity can make them difficult to interpret, which is critical to indicator utility for ecosystem management. Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) is an example of a biological assessment approach that has been widely tested for indicating freshwater wetland condition, but less attention has been given to clarifying the factors controlling its response. FQA quantifies the aggregate of vascular plant species tolerance to habitat degradation (conservatism), and model variants have incorporated species richness, abundance, and indigenity (native or non-native). To assess bias, we tested FQA variants in open-canopy freshwater wetlands against three independent reference measures, using practical vegetation sampling methods. FQA variants incorporating species richness did not correlate with our reference measures and were influenced by wetland size and hydrogeomorphic class. In contrast, FQA variants lacking measures of species richness responded linearly to reference measures quantifying individual and aggregate stresses, suggesting a broad response to cumulative degradation. FQA variants incorporating non-native species, and a variant additionally incorporating relative species abundance, improved performance over using only native species. We relate our empirical findings to ecological theory to clarify the functional properties and implications of the FQA variants. Our analysis indicates that (1) aggregate conservatism reliably declines with increased disturbance; (2) species richness has varying relationships with disturbance and increases with site area, confounding FQA response; and (3) non-native species signal human disturbance. We propose that incorporating species abundance can improve FQA site-level relevance with little extra sampling effort. Using our practical sampling methods, an FQA variant ignoring species richness and incorporating non-native species and relative species abundance can be logistically efficient, easily understood, and effective for wetland assessment.

AB  - Habitat diversity reflects the range of available habitats used by species with different niche requirements and, therefore, influences species diversity. Land use influences stream condition, and streams in poor condition are often wide, shallow, sediment-laden channels with low instream habitat diversity. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of instream habitat diversity on fish species diversity, the effect of stream habitat condition on habitat diversity, and the effect of habitat diversity, stream condition, and other natural stream features on fish assemblage structure (proportional abundance) in an impaired upper Snake River basin watershed containing a locally diverse but regionally depauperate species pool. We sampled fishes and instream and riparian habitat at 41 sites, focusing on measures of instream habitat diversity and the following stream condition indicators: livestock trails on streambanks, streambank stability, channel width-to-depth ratio, percent fine substrates, and woody riparian vegetation. Multiple regression revealed that fish species diversity was positively associated with all four components of habitat diversity, that is, diversity in substrate, cover, water depth, and water velocity (P < 0.09, adjusted R-2 = 0.642). All four components of habitat diversity increased with stream size, and each component was negatively but weakly associated with at least one stream condition indicator (P < 0.10, adjusted R-2 = 0.23 to 0.61). Fish assemblage structure was influenced primarily by natural stream features (gradient, temperature) and secondarily by stream condition indicators and streamflow diversity. Our results connect fish species diversity increases in larger streams with concomitant increases in four dimensions of instream habitat diversity. The findings show how stream condition reflecting land uses, such as riparian over-grazing, can negatively impact habitat diversity within that stream-size continuum, thus emphasizing the role land management plays in maintaining fish species diversity.

AB  - We quantify main ecosystem services (i.e. the contribution of ecosystems to human well-being) provided by rivers, lakes, coastal waters and connected ecosystems (riparian areas and floodplains) in Europe, including water provisioning, water purification, erosion prevention, flood protection, coastal protection, and recreation. We show European maps of ecosystem service capacity, flow (actual use), sustainability and efficiency. Then we explore the relationship between the services and the ecosystem condition at the European scale, considering the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems, reported under the EU Water Framework Directive, as a measure of the ecosystem integrity and biodiversity.
   Our results indicate that a higher delivery of the regulating and cultural ecosystem services analysed is mostly correlated with better conditions of aquatic ecosystems. Conversely, the use of provisioning services can result in pressures on the ecosystem. This suggests the importance of maintaining good ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services in the future. These results at the continental scale, although limited to the ecosystem services under analysis, might be relevant to consider when investing in the protection and restoration of aquatic ecosystems called for by the current EU water policy and Biodiversity Strategy and by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Fish are good indicators of the environmental health of rivers and their catchinents as well as important conservation targets. Bioindication has to be based on an understanding of the requirement of characteristic species with regard to: (a) The match/mismatch between reproductive strategies and environmental conditions. (b) The niche dimensions of critical stages vis-a-vis the key conditions. (c) The availability of microhabitats along the ontogenetic niche profiles, i.e. the connectivity from spawning substrates to early life history microhabitats. The main conditions for the embryonic period are temperature and oxygen supply which are responsible for embryonic mortality, the duration of the period, and size and condition of newly-hatched larvae. For the exogenously feeding larvae the functional of food acquisition, growth and bioenergetics to temperature, food availability and current velocity is decisive. Studies concentrated on Chondrostoma nasus, a target species for monitoring and conservation in large European river systems. Results obtained in experimental studies are compared with those from field studies in order to evaluate the match/mismatch between performances and microhabitat choice and population dynamics in the field. Discrepancies between requirements and field conditions in regulated rivers underline the significance of inshore zones as microhabitats (expressed in the 'Inshore Retention Concept') and the requirement for ecophysiological studies on target species for river restoration and conservation.

AB  - All over the world marine waters are under increasing pressure from human activities affecting marine ecosystems. Several EU Directives require assessment of the condition of marine environments; in particular the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) applies an ecosystem approach to the management of human activities. In this context, the mapping of pressures in a standardized and comparable way is a critical step to assess the spatial pattern, the temporal change and the ecological impacts of human pressures. Within the MSFD, one of the stressors directly affecting the seafloor is the Physical Loss (PL) pressure, representing the permanent or long-term alteration of marine habitats. The main purpose of this study was to propose a method to estimate the spatial extent of PL pressure in the framework of the Initial Assessment phase of the MSFD. Furthermore, considering that human activities PL-related cause the loss of benthic habitats, and that the Mediterranean sea is characterized by sensitive and protected habitats such as the biogenic substrates sensu MSFD, the distribution of PL pressure was overlaid with the distribution of the seabed habitats to estimate the loss of biogenic substrates. This study represents a useful tool for establishing the baseline condition for PL pressure, to compare future conditions and to evaluate different management scenarios. Moreover, it allows identification of the areas where pressure tends to accumulate as 'hot spots' on which to focus in future impact analyses and the areas where few stressors are present.

AB  - Over time, several indices have been developed for assessing estuarine environmental conditions. In many cases, these indicators were chosen at least partly based on human value judgements that may or may not be justified or defensible. We present a new, 2-step multivariate approach that impartially identifies a suite of ecological indicators and then determines their relationship to environmental conditions in San Antonio Bay, Texas. A total of 12 fisheries indicator species were identified by the PRIMER BEST analysis procedure, including Leiostomus xanthurus, Bairdiella chrysoura, Pogonias cromis, Portunus gibbesii, Callinectes similis, Ictalurus furcatus, Harengula jaguana, Polydactylus octonemus, Loliiguncula brevis, Macrobrachium ohione, Opisthonema oglinum, and Libinia dubia. This suite of indicators showed the highest rank correlation with variation in the environmental variables measured. Subsequent redundancy analysis of the relationship between these indicators and environmental variables revealed salinity as the most influential variable shaping the indicator assemblage, with turbidity the second most influential. When freshwater inflow increased or salinity was low, I. furcatus, M. ohione, and O. oglinum were at their highest relative numbers in the assemblage; conversely, when salinity was high, L. brevis, L. dubia, and C. similis were at their highest relative abundances. Additionally, the euryhaline species L. xanthurus and B. chrysoura were negatively related to water turbidity. The 2-step analysis presented provides a statistically robust way to impartially identify biological indicators most responsive to the environmental variables of interest, and thus provides managers with a robust method for monitoring the effects of their management actions.

AB  - The ecological integrity of rivers ultimately depends on flow regime. Flow degradation is especially prominent in Mediterranean systems and assessing environmental flows in modified rivers is difficult, especially in environments with poor hydrologic monitoring and data availability. In many Mediterranean countries, which are characterized by pronounced natural variability and low summer flows, water management actions usually focus on prescribing minimum acceptable flows estimated by hydrologic methods. In this study, a comparative assessment of environmental flow estimation methods is developed in a river with poorly monitored flows and limited understanding of past reference conditions. This assessment incorporates both a hydrologic and a fish habitat simulation effort that takes into consideration hydrologic seasonality in a Greek mountainous river. The results of this study indicate that especially in data scarce regions the utilization of biotic indicators through habitat models, may provide valuable information, beyond that achievable with hydrologic methods, for developing regional environmental flow criteria. Despite the widespread use of the method, challenges in transferability of fish habitat simulation provide undefined levels of uncertainty and may require the concurrent use of different assessment tools and site-specific study.

AB  - Palm oil production provides economic benefits in developing countries but its development can drastically alter landscapes. We investigated an oil palm-dominated landscape in New Britain, Papua New Guinea, and developed a simple remote sensing approach, supported by site visits and video surveys, to assess the condition and the extent of recent change in riparian zones. Riparian buffer zones were extensively modified. Riparian disturbance occurred in both corporate plantations and smallholder blocks. Older areas of oil palm were planted before riparian buffer zone protocols were established, but there has been continuing recent loss and disturbance of natural riparian vegetation, despite increasing awareness of the importance of riparian buffer zones. Explanations for this are complex. For smallholders, a rapidly growing population is increasing the need for income-generating oil palm planting and household gardens, leading to utilisation of riparian zones for oil palm, gardens or villages. Improved management of riparian zones, combined with effective monitoring, is essential to maintain or improve ecological functioning and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems and the associated benefits for local communities. In conclusion, the simple remote sensing approach developed here, supported by ground truthing and video surveys, provides a robust and effective means of assessing riparian condition in a complex and changing landscape. The techniques could be used to assess the effectiveness of future initiatives to improve aquatic ecosystem condition in similar agriculture-dominated regions.

AB  - The Northern Prairie Pothole Region (NPPR) of Alberta, Canada, contains numerous shallow marshes that serve as important habitat for wildlife and provide essential ecosystem services. Many of these wetlands have been destroyed or degraded by human activity and the majority of remaining wetlands occur in landscapes affected by crop and cattle production. Alberta has implemented a conservation policy which requires the creation of wetland assessment tools. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are frequently used as indicators of environmental condition in rivers, but their effectiveness as indicators in prairie pothole wetlands is not clear. To evaluate the capacity of aquatic macroinvertebrates identified to family-level resolution to serve as regional bioindicators of agricultural disturbance in NPPR wetlands, we sampled macroinvertebrates at 64 fishless wetlands. The wetlands spanned a gradient in the extent of agriculture from 0 to 100% cover within a 500 m buffer around each wetland. We discovered that, contrary to our predictions, macroinvertebrate family richness and community composition could not predict agricultural disturbance (cropping or cattle grazing). We conclude that efforts to develop bioindicators for NPPR wetlands should be redirected to other taxa that are less costly to identify to species and that exhibit sensitivity to agricultural disturbance.

AB  - Using data collected for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA), we developed separate multimetric indices (MMIs) for vegetation, soil, algae taxa, and water to assess condition of freshwater wetlands in the northeastern US. This study represents the first attempt at developing multiple biotic and abiotic MMIs of wetland condition over this large of an area, and is only possible because of the high quality data collected by the NWCA. We chose metrics that distinguished between reference and most disturbed sites, had a signal:noise ratio > 2, and were not strongly correlated with other metrics, latitude, or longitude. The vegetation and soil MMIs were the best performing indices, with good separation between reference and most disturbed sites, and included commonly used condition metrics (e.g., pH and P concentration for soil, and percent cover of exotic species for vegetation). The algae MMI was the weakest index, with considerable overlap between reference and most disturbed sites. For areas smaller than our study, algae taxa may be suitable for wetland MMIs. However, in our study area, many algae taxa followed strong latitudinal or longitudinal gradients, and could not be considered for the algae MMI. Small sample size and several metrics with a high signal:noise ratio were the major limitations of the water MMI. We also examined how well landscape (level 1) and rapid assessment (level 2) metrics predicted MMIs using random forest regression. Agricultural land use surrounding wetlands was an important predictor for all four MMIs, although the soil, algae and water MMI models performed best when intensive (level 3) vegetation metrics were also included in the random forest regression models. Based on these results, we recommend wetland assessment programs employ a combination of landscape and rapid assessment monitoring at many sites, along with level 3 monitoring at a subset of sites. We developed these MMIs to evaluate freshwater wetland condition for a long-term monitoring program in Acadia National Park. These MMIs are also applicable to a range of wetland types covering 11 states in the northeastern United States and can be calculated using a downloadable spreadsheet that calculates and rates each MMI using raw metric values.

AB  - Research Highlights: This is the first approach that integrates biodiversity data into Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystem and their Services (MAES) implementation and natural capital accounting process, at the national scale, using an extensive vascular plant dataset for Greece. Background and Objectives: The study aims to support the MAES implementation in Greece, by assessing, as a pilot, the woodland and forest ecosystem type; the targets of the study are: (a) Identify and map ecosystem type extent; (b) identify ecosystem condition using biodiversity in terms of plant species richness (i.e., total, ecosystem exclusive, endemic, ecosystem exclusive endemic diversity); (c) develop ecosystem asset proxy indicators by combining ecosystem extent and ecosystem condition outcomes; (d) identify shortcomings; and (e) propose future steps and implications for the MAES implementation and natural capital accounting, based on biodiversity data. Materials and Methods: Following the national European Union's and United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounts-Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA) guidelines and the adopted National Set of MAES Indicators, we developed a set of four proxy ecosystem asset indicators to assess ecosystem types with respect to ecosystem area extent and ecosystem condition. This was as interpreted by its plant diversity in terms of species richness (total, ecosystem exclusive, endemic, and ecosystem exclusive endemic diversity). Results: The results revealed that when indicators use well-developed biodiversity datasets, in combination with ecosystem extent data, they can provide the baseline for ecosystem condition assessment, ecosystem asset delineation, and support operational MAES studies. Conclusions: The relation among biodiversity, ecosystem condition, and ecosystem services is not a linear equation and detailed, fine-scale assessments are needed to identify and interpret all aspects of biodiversity. However, areas of importance are pinpointed throughout Greece, and guidance is provided for case-study selection, conservation strategy, and decision-making under the perspective of national and EU environmental policies.

AB  - Increasing human pressures have a negative impact on freshwater habitats and their biota worldwide. To protect habitats and the species contained within them, ecological assessments over a gradient of near natural to degraded freshwater habitats are essential. Odonata assemblages were investigated at 46 study sites in Croatia encompassing slightly to heavily modified lowland rivers and streams. Nymphs were sampled between April and September 2016 using a benthos hand net. A total of 19 species was recorded, and Ischnura elegans (Vander Linden, 1820) and Platycnemis pennipes (Pallas, 1771) were most frequently recorded. RDA analysis indicated that water pollution (i.e. levels of chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon), water temperature and oxygen concentration had the highest influence in the formation of Odonata assemblages at a specific habitat, reflecting their widely recognized bioindicator properties. This study showed that degraded lowland rivers can provide habitat for a relatively low number of species with broad ecological tolerance, while rare and specialist species are generally not able to reproduce there. These results contribute to our knowledge of Odonata occurrence in anthropogenically impacted habitats, and their relationships with such degraded environment.

AB  - The influence of environmental changes on organisms depends on their bionomic characteristics, such as mobility, body size, and resource use. Thermoregulatory and dispersal abilities may directly affect the use of odonates as bioindicators since organisms with low dispersal ability can track fine-scale environmental variations and are usually resource specialists. We investigated the utility of dragonflies (Anisoptera) and damselflies (Zygoptera) as bioindicators testing possible relationships to their bionomic characteristics. We assessed the variation in species richness, composition, and indicator values in Cerrado areas by quantitative sampling of adult odonates in streams surrounded by different vegetation types, ordered by the degree of vegetation cover. Species composition was efficient in discriminating impacts affecting riparian vegetation, with low richness of rare and specialist species in impacted areas. Damselflies had more narrow requirements, associated to different shading, depth, and environmental integrity levels. No relation between body-size and species indicator value was observed. Despite this, the main use of those species as indicators, especially the Zygoptera, may be related to environmental disturbance created by changes on vegetation cover suggesting their potential use in the analysis of the environmental quality of riparian areas.

AB  - The study of ecosystem processes over multiple scales of space and time is often best achieved using comparable data from multiple sites. Yet, long-term ecological observatories have often developed their own data collection protocols. Here, we address this problem by proposing a set of ecological protocols suitable for widespread adoption by the ecological community. Scientists from the European ecological research community prioritized terrestrial ecosystem parameters that could benefit from a more consistent approach to data collection within the resources available at most long-term ecological observatories. Parameters for which standard methods are in widespread use, or for which methods are evolving rapidly, were not selected. Protocols were developed by domain experts, building on existing methods where possible, and refined through a process of field testing and training. They address above-ground plant biomass; decomposition; land use and management; leaf area index; soil mesofaunal diversity; soil C and N stocks, and greenhouse gas emissions from soils. These complement existing methods to provide a complete assessment of ecological integrity. These protocols offer integrated approaches to ecological data collection that are low cost and are starting to be used across the European Long Term Ecological Research community.

AB  - Urbanization compromises the biotic integrity and health of streams, and indicators of integrity loss are needed to improve assessment programs and identify mechanisms of urban effects. We investigated linkages between landscapes and assemblages in 31 wadeable Piedmont streams in the Etowah River basin in northern Georgia (USA). Our objectives were to identify the indicators of macroinvertebrate and fish integrity from a large set of best land cover (n = 45), geomorphology (n = 115), and water quality (it = 12) variables, and to evaluate the potential for variables measured with minimal cost and effort to effectively predict biotic integrity. Macroinvertebrate descriptors were better predicted by land cover whereas fish descriptors were better predicted by geomorphology. Water quality variables demonstrated moderate levels of predictive power for biotic descriptors. Macroinvertebrate descriptors were best predicted by urban cover (-), conductivity (-), fines in riffles and local relief (+). Fish descriptors were best predicted by embeddedness (-), turbidity (-), slope and forest cover (+). We used multiple linear regression modeling to predict descriptors using three independent variable sets that varied in difficulty of data collection. "Full" models included a full range of geomorphic, water quality and landscape variables regardless of the intensity of data collection efforts. "Reduced" models included GIS-derived variables describing catchment morphometry and land use as well as variables easily collected in the field with minimal cost and effort. "Simple" models only included GIS-derived variables. Full models explained 63-81% of the variation among descriptors, indicating strong relationships between landscape properties and biotic assemblages across our sites. Reduced and simple models were weaker, explaining 48-79% and 42-79%, respectively, of the variance among descriptors. Considering the difference in predictive power among these model sets, we recommend a tiered approach to variable selection and model development depending upon management goals. GIS variables are simple and inexpensive to collect, and a GIS-based modeling approach would be appropriate for goals such as site screening (e.g., identification of reference streams). As management goals become more complex (e.g., long-term monitoring programs), additional, easily collected field variables (e.g., embeddedness) should be included. Finally, labor-intensive variables (e.g., nutrients and fines in sediments) could be added to meet complex management goals such as restoration of impaired streams or mechanistic studies of land use effects on stream ecosystems.

AB  - Rewilding is emerging as a promising restoration strategy to enhance the conservation status of biodiversity and promote self-regulating ecosystems while re-engaging people with nature. Overcoming the challenges in monitoring and reporting rewilding projects would improve its practical implementation and maximize its conservation and restoration outcomes. Here, we present a novel approach for measuring and monitoring progress in rewilding that focuses on the ecological attributes of rewilding. We devised a bi-dimensional framework for assessing the recovery of processes and their natural dynamics through (i) decreasing human forcing on ecological processes and (ii) increasing ecological integrity of ecosystems. The rewilding assessment framework incorporates the reduction of material inputs and outputs associated with human management, as well as the restoration of natural stochasticity and disturbance regimes, landscape connectivity and trophic complexity. Furthermore, we provide a list of potential activities for increasing the ecological integrity after reviewing the evidence for the effectiveness of common restoration actions. For illustration purposes, we apply the framework to three flagship restoration projects in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Argentina. This approach has the potential to broaden the scope of rewilding projects, facilitate sound decision-making and connect the science and practice of rewilding.

AB  - Benthic communities of macroinvertebrates, algae, and microorganisms were concurrently collected using a Surber sampler (30 x 30 m(2); 300 mu m mesh), brush (5 x 5 cm(2)), and syringe (100 mL; Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis), respectively, to determine the ecological integrity of streams with different levels of pollution. Macroinvertebrates provided a clearer representation of the gradient of pollution, while a broader scope of species distribution was observed for algae and microorganisms, including sites severely polluted with heavy metals. Species associations among different taxa were presented on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) based on environmental factors. After screening, indicator species visualized on the SOM represented a wider range of environmental impacts and were more illustrative with benthic macroinvertebrates in least polluted sites. In contrast NMDS presented species more closely associated with overall variance of communities with severe pollution, mainly in microorganisms and algae. Multi-taxa community analysis using SOM and NMDS in combination would provide a comprehensive assessment for addressing ecological integrity in streams. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Open science principles that seek to improve science can effectively bridge the gap between researchers and environmental managers. However, widespread adoption has yet to gain traction for the development and application of bioassessment products. At the core of this philosophy is the concept that research should be reproducible and transparent, in addition to having long-term value through effective data preservation and sharing. In this article, we review core open science concepts that have recently been adopted in the ecological sciences and emphasize how adoption can benefit the field of bioassessment for both prescriptive condition assessments and proactive applications that inform environmental management. An example from the state of California demonstrates effective adoption of open science principles through data stewardship, reproducible research, and engagement of stakeholders with multimedia applications. We also discuss technical, sociocultural, and institutional challenges for adopting open science, including practical approaches for overcoming these hurdles in bioassessment applications.

AB  - Mayfly taxa are widely accepted as bioindicators of water quality, due to the wide variety of substrates they live on and high chances of detecting the pollution impact by assessing their community structure. Ephemeroptera samples and physicochemical data were analysed for 12 sites along the 151 km long stretch of the Nisava River in southeastern Serbia during a one-year period. Twenty eight morphologically distinct taxa belonging to eight genera were identified. The dominant genera were Baetis (35.27%) and Ephemerella (29.44%). The Ephemeroptera community structure analysis of samples from the Nisava River has shown a clear dependence of the mayfly community on the habitat type, physical and chemical parameters, and the season. The lowest Shannon's diversity index was estimated for the localities with the lowest percentage of the solid substrate and the highest average content of phosphorus and nitrogen.

AB  - Spatial distribution of contaminants in the sediments and biota of a large reservoir ecosystem were related to a variety of biological responses in fish populations and communities to determine possible relationships between contaminant loading in the environment and fish health. Much of the contaminant inventory in the Clinch River/Watts Bar Reservoir (CR/WBR) system has originated from three U.S. Department of Energy facilities on the Oak Ridge Reservation, which borders this system in its upper reaches. Fish sampled from areas of the CR/WBR system with the highest levels of contaminants in the sediments and biota, primarily mercury and PCBs, had the most dramatic bioindicator responses. The major changes observed were induction of detoxification enzymes, organ dysfunction, increased frequency of histopathological lesions, impaired reproduction, and reduced fish community integrity. Mercury, the dominant contaminant, displayed a decreasing concentration gradient from the: upper reaches of Poplar Creek to the lower Clinch River, which was consistent with a downstream gradient in several of the biological responses. A multivariate analysis using all of the individual fish health responses at each sire in a discriminant analysis procedure also revealed a downstream gradient in integrated fish health. In Poplar Creek where contaminant concentrations were the highest, statistical correlations were observed between individual bioindicator responses such as contaminant exposure indicators. organ dysfunction, histopathological damage, and reproductive impairment. Relationships between contaminant Loading and fish community indices such as species richness and relative abundance, however, were more difficult to establish in Poplar Creek because of the possible dominating influence of food and habitat availability on fish community dynamics. Using a suite of bioindicators that encompass a range of levels of biological organization and response-sensitivity scales improves the probability of identifying cause (contaminant) and effect (biological response) and helps in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic sources of stress in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Assessing ecosystem health is an ongoing priority for governments, scientists and managers worldwide. There are several decades of scientific literature discussing ecosystem health and approaches to assess it, with applications to aquatic and terrestrial environments incorporating economic, environmental and social processes. We conducted a systematic review of studies that assess ecosystem health to update our current understanding of how ecosystem health is being defined, and provide new ideas and directions on how it can be measured. We focused the review on studies that used the term 'ecosystem health' or the equivalent terms 'ecosystem integrity', 'ecosystem quality' and 'ecosystem protection', in lotic freshwater and estuarine environments, and examined how many of these included explicit definitions of what ecosystem health means for their study system. We collected information about the temporal and geographical distribution of studies, and the types of indicators (biological, physical or chemical) used in the assessments. We found few studies clearly defined ecosystem health and justified the choice of indicators. Given the broad use of the term it seems impractical to have an overarching definition of ecosystem health, but rather an approach that is able to define and measure health on a case by case basis. A combination of biological, physical and chemical indicators was commonly used to assess ecosystem health in both estuarine and freshwater studies, with a strong bias towards fish and macroinvertebrate community metrics (e.g. diversity, abundance and composition). We found only two studies that simultaneously considered both freshwater and estuarine sections of the ecosystem, highlighting the significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the transfer of flow, nutrients and biota between the different systems all key factors that influence ecosystem health. This review is the first to combine knowledge from both freshwater and estuarine ecosystem assessments and critically review how aquatic ecosystem health is defined and measured since the late-1990s, providing the basis for setting achievable management goals relating to ecosystem health into the future.

AB  - Among environmental managers, recognition of the importance of integrating management activities across agencies and programs that have different responsibilities for the same geographic areas has created an awareness of the need for a common hierarchical framework of ecological regions (ecoregions) to implement the strategy. Responding to this need in the United States, nine federal agencies have signed a memorandum of understanding on the subject of developing a common framework of ecoregions. However, considerable disagreement over how to define ecoregions and confusion over the strengths and limitations of existing frameworks stand in the way of achieving this goal. This paper presents some perspectives on the nature and definition of ecoregions related to this confusion and provides a brief overview of the weight of evidence approach to mapping ecoregions, using an example initiated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. To effectively implement ecosystem assessment, management, and research at local, regional, and national levels, research is needed to increase our understanding of ecoregions. We must find ways to illustrate the nature of ecoregion boundaries and the variability of characteristics within ecoregions as they relate to management issues. Research must also be conducted on comparing existing frameworks and developing indices of ecological integrity to effectively evaluate their usefulness.

AB  - By relating observed changes to the pressures suffered, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive intends to better control the factors of environmental degradation and to manage their consequences in European waters. Several descriptors are defined within the framework of the MFSD and in particular descriptor 1 relating to the biological diversity of the seabed and descriptor 6 relating to the seabed integrity (i.e. the quality of their structures and functions). For each descriptor, indicators and threshold values must be defined and a novel conceptual approach to define and detect seabed integrity thresholds is proposed here. Bottom trawling being the main source of shelf continental disturbance, it is important to evaluate its impact on benthic habitat. The goal of this study is to propose a methodology to determine "Good Ecological Status" threshold values for each habitat type present in three contrasted MFSD sub-region (North Sea, English Channel and Mediterranean Sea). Trawling impacts are dependent of the spatial and temporal distribution of the fishing effort, fishing gears, intensity of natural disturbances and habitat types. Benthic community structures present in these areas were studied using by-catch non-commercial benthic invertebrates data collected during French scientific bottom trawl surveys. Swept area ratios derived from VMS data were used to quantify the intensity of fishery induced abrasion on the seabed. A modeling approach was used to determine abrasion threshold values on each EUNIS level 4 habitat. The values, beyond which trawling has an adverse effect on benthic communities, have been determined for each habitat. This made it possible to assess and map the ecological status of each of the habitats and to determine the percentage of each habitat impacted by trawling. The method proposed here to evaluate the impact of trawling on benthic communities highlighted that the vast majority of the investigated sub-regions were adversely impacted or lost as a result of seabed impacting trawling.

AB  - Most national standards for assessment of water quality include physical and chemical indicators relevant to specific pollutants and stressors. However, biological communities reflect not only current conditions of aquatic resources but also change in conditions over time and impacts from multiple stressors. Assessing the health of the aquatic community (that is, bioassessments) has proven to be critical in protecting and maintaining healthy surface waters under the mandates of regulatory frameworks, such as the Clean Water Act in the USA and the Water Framework Directive of the European Union. Whereas, in Thailand water standards, bioassessment is lacking in favor of chemical criteria, only coliform bacteria measurement can be considered a surrogate biological parameter. Our paper argues that incorporating bioassessment will improve water resource condition evaluations and recommends the use of the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage as a bioassessment framework in Thailand. We discuss the implementation of a bioassessment program that consists of two major components, (a) a scientifically valid technical approach and (b) consideration of technical resources for a cost-effective program. The technical design comprises (1) classification of streams into similar groupings, (2) design of a biological survey, (3) a well-documented sampling protocol, (4) calibration of biological metrics for data analysis, (5) development of criteria for determination of ecological condition, and (6) communication of the results to citizens and policymakers. A cost-effective way to develop a bioassessment program that will improve Thailand's ability to measure water quality and to make good decisions to attain healthy quality status is to establish partnerships by coordinating efforts and sharing data and technology with adjacent regional environmental offices or provinces. This collaboration would be fostered through a long-term national water resources management strategy and clear definition of goals and desired outcomes that are critical components of the overall National Plan for Ecological Health.

AB  - According to the contemporary ecosystem approach, integrated management of natural resources recognizes that humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems. Therefore, the linkages of human actions with their environment have to be assessed in an integrative manner. Appropriate models and indicators, data and information for human and environmental systems are needed as well as suitable linkages between the specific components. In this paper, an indicator framework for the analysis and assessment of complex human-environmental systems is presented. An example application from a research project dealing with the development of sustainable management strategies for the husbandry of semi-domesticated reindeer in northern Fenno-Scandinavia illustrates the potentials and limitations of this framework. The concept and indicators of ecological integrity are used to assess the impacts of reindeer herding on the natural environment. Human well-being is evaluated with indicators for social and economic welfare. in conjunction with three scenarios, associated with varying land use patterns and land use priorities, the relevance of the particular components for a sustainable resource management in the case study area was estimated and recommendations to management authorities could be given.

AB  - We assessed how diatom metrics were related to different ranges of agricultural land use. Diatom assemblage composition, nutrients, and landscape characteristics were determined at 232 sites in eight agriculturally dominated study areas of the continental United States. Two regional groups based on differences in diatom relations to human disturbance were determined. Changes in diatom species composition were related to nutrients, pH, and conductivity in the eastern study areas (due to more wetlands) and more exclusively to nutrients in the west-central study areas. Homogenization of diatom flora among streams was related to high agricultural disturbance at this transcontinental scale. Species traits were developed separately for the east and west-central study groups and calculated two ways: indicator species analysis for taxa in low and high TN or TP conditions and weighted average partial least squares models of TN and TP concentration. These diatom metrics were significantly related to many indicators of agricultural land use in watersheds, especially percent row crops. Further analysis was conducted on only the west-central region due to its larger sample size. Overall, diatom metrics using species responses to N gradients were better related to agricultural land use than were species responses to P gradients. Most nutrient-based diatom metrics changed greatly in response to low ranges of percent row crops, but only a few high N diatom metrics responded to high row crop conditions. The greater response of diatoms to changes in low agriculture conditions may be due to past diatom evolution occurring when most waters had low nutrient conditions.

AB  - Over-enrichment leading to excess algal growth is a major problemin rivers and streams. Regulations to protect streams typically incorporate nutrient criteria, concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen that should not be exceeded in order to protect biological communities. A major challenge has been to develop an approach for both categorizing streams based on their biological conditions and determining scientifically defensible nutrient criteria to protect the biotic integrity of streams in those categories. To address this challenge, we applied the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) approach to stream diatom assemblages to develop a system for categorizing sites by level of impairment, and then examined the related nutrient concentrations to identify potential nutrient criteria.
   The six levels of the BCG represent a range of ecological conditions from natural (1) to highly disturbed (6). A group of diatom experts developed a set of rules and a model to assign sites to these levels based on their diatom assemblages. To identify potential numeric nutrient criteria, we explored the relation of assigned BCG levels to nutrient concentrations, other anthropogenic stressors, and possible confounding variables using data for stream sites in New Jersey (n= 42) and in surrounding Mid-Atlantic states, USA (n= 1443). In both data sets, BCG levels correlated most strongly with total phosphorus and the percentage of forest in the water shed, but were independent of pH. We applied Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to determine change-points in the diatom assemblages along the BCG gradient. In both data sets, statistically significant diatom changes occurred between BCG levels 3 and 4. Sites with BCG levels 1 to 3 were dominated by species that grow attached to surfaces, while sites with BCG scores of 4 and above were characterized by motile diatoms. The diatom change-point corresponded with a total phosphorus concentration of about 50 mu g/L. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Establishing criteria for protecting or improving wetland condition has often focused on physical and chemical factors, which can paint an incomplete picture of wetland quality. To protect the biological integrity of aquatic environments, identifying criteria based on biological responses to pollution is essential. We hypothesize that assessment of multiple taxonomic groups and response thresholds will provide statistically defensible effects-based methods to define reference condition and establish biological criteria. We used regression tree analysis to identify non-linear biological responses of three taxonomic groups (macrophytes, epiphytic diatoms, and plant-associated zooplankton) collected from 36 depressional wetlands in the Muskegon River watershed (Michigan, USA). Multi-metric biotic indices were developed for all three taxonomic groups and these indices were combined to reveal biologically relevant thresholds along a gradient of human disturbance. We found these three taxonomic groups responded at similar levels of impairment and could be used to classify wetlands into three groups: reference sites representing the highest quality wetlands in the landscape; slightly altered sites where the most sensitive organisms responded (sensitive plants, diatoms); and degraded sites where extensive changes in community structure occurred, which may reflect a shift to an alternate state. For the Muskegon River watershed, in particular, this analysis allowed us to identify sites in need of restoration, including approximately one-third of the depressional wetlands in the watershed. This study outlines a method for identifying criteria that could be used for regulatory purposes. In particular, we recommend the use of community-level metrics in identifying broad-based changes in community composition that may represent shifts to alternate states, as well as the use of sensitive indicators, such as the occurrence of sensitive plant and diatom taxa.

AB  - Ocean sandy beaches are prime sites for human recreation. The integrity of these ecosystems may suffer greatly from tourism-related pressures. Behavioural adaptations of fauna are key traits as responses to environmental pressures and short time changes. In particular, orientation performance of talitrid amphipods to recover the optimal zone on the beach has been proposed as bioindicator of shoreline stability, mainly related to sedimentary dynamics and geomorphological changes. The question focused here was whether recreational activities and urbanisation may influence orientation performance of talitrids on oceanic tropical beaches with contrasting extension (beach length).
   Field orientation experiments were performed during Spring 2014 testing populations of the talitrid Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis on four tropical beaches at Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), selected according to their human access (two with and two without public access) and length (two pocket and two extended beaches). The influence of landscape cues on the orientation of talitrids was experimentally tested in two etho-assay conditions: with and without the landscape vision. Talitrids used landscape cues and sun compass to orient seawards and the highest precision of orientation was recorded in the pocicet beach without human access. A more scattered response was observed in the urbanised pocket beach under conditions of screened landscape and when the sun was veiled or covered by clouds, showing the importance of the local landscape features in these conditions. The populations from the extended beaches showed a similar and more scattered orientation, which may be interpreted as behavioural plasticity to cope with beach natural changes, disregarding human pressure on the beaches. The behavioural performances of talitrids on the four tropical beaches varied according to different human pressure conditions and beach extension, confirming the reliability of the use of talitrid orientation as bioindicator of beach changeability.

AB  - Selective logging has become a major source of threats to tropical forest, bringing challenges for both ecologists and managers to develop low-impact forestry. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a prominent activity accounting for such forestry practices to prevent strong forest disturbances. Our aims were to evaluate the effects of RIL on insect communities of forested streams from Eastern Amazon and to test the hypothesis of negative effects of RIL on species richness, abundance, and functional feeding groups of aquatic insect assemblages. Neither of the evaluated metrics of the studied assemblages were negatively affected by RIL. Environmental metrics, such as substrate heterogeneity, woody canopy cover, and hill slope height, varied more among RIL streams than in reference streams, indicating a gradient according to logging impacts, and are suitable candidates to monitor RIL impacts in Amazonian streams. In addition, the PHI index also varied among REF and RIL, according to age class and year of logging, which could reflect trends to recover the forest structure after logging in a time frame of only 10 years. We conclude that RIL impacts have not had detrimental impacts on insect communities, but have changed little of the environmental conditions, especially of the riparian vegetation around streams.

AB  - In this study we evaluated the usefulness of rotifer emergence from dry soils to indicate the environmental status of a remnant temporary pond complex in an agricultural area in central Spain. Because the ponds did not flood during our project, emergence was studied in relation to environmental variables in outdoor microcosms. Redundancy analysis and nestedness analysis showed that salinity and total nitrogen concentrations shaped the emerged communities. Depauperate rotifer assemblages from pond microcosms with higher salinity and nitrogen levels were nested subsets of species-rich communities from microcosms of less enriched sites. Rotifer community structure also identified small ponds as reference sites that should receive priority in conservation and degradation mitigation programs. Results suggest that rotifer emergence from rewetted sediments using microcosms can be useful for evaluating the nutrient status during the dry phase of temporary wetlands. While results from this approach are conservative, requiring comparisons with field observations, their tentative value lies in alerting management and providing a basis for future research of poorly studied but threatened temporary habitats. Rotifer emergence could be a useful alternative to traditional biological indicators of nutrient status that depend on the presence of water. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article analyzes the effects of increasing urbanization on open space preserves within the metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Time series analysis is used in 10-year increments over 40 years to study urban landscape change. Three landscape metrics-(1) matrix utility (measures intensity of adjacent land uses), (2) isolation (measures distances to other open space patches), and (3) connectivity (measures physical links to other open space patches and corridors)-are used to assess changes in landscape patterns and serve as indicators of urban ecological integrity of the open space preserves. Results show that in the case of both open space preserves, general decline in indicators of urban ecological integrity was evident. The matrix utility analysis demonstrated that increasing intensity of land uses adjacent to preserve is likely to increase edge effects, reducing the habitat value of interior or core habitat areas. Isolation analysis showed that both preserves have experienced increasing isolation from other open space elements over time. Also, connectivity analysis indicated that terrestrial connections to other open space elements have also deteriorated. Conclusions of this research demonstrate that while preservation of natural areas as open space is important in an urban context, intense development of surrounding areas reduces the urban ecological integrity significantly.

AB  - Stated preference scenarios often describe outcomes to be valued in terms of intermediate biophysical processes or ecosystem services with indirect utility effects, rather than in terms of final, directly welfare-relevant consequences. This article evaluates whether valid welfare estimates can emerge from this practice. We begin with a theoretical model demonstrating conditions under which stated preference scenarios that include intermediate outcomes will elicit welfare estimates identical to those from parallel scenarios that include associated final outcomes (i.e., convergent validity will hold). The model demonstrates that a necessary condition for convergent validity is the ability of respondents to correctly predict biophysical production functions linking intermediate to final outcomes. Hypotheses from the theoretical model are then evaluated empirically using an application of choice experiments to migratory fish restoration in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Empirical results are mixed but generally reject convergent validity; welfare estimates are not robust to the use of an intermediate outcome in lieu of a related final outcome in stated preference scenarios, as predicted by theory. Results of the analysis suggest that greater attention should be given to the reliability of welfare estimation when final outcomes cannot be quantified.

AB  - Multimetric index (MMI) approach is a broadly used in ecological assessment because it can integrate information of various kinds of ecologically related metrics of freshwater ecosystems and provide an easily understandable score for purpose of further evaluation and managements. Accounting for natural variation and disentangling covariation between natural environmental factors and human disturbance factors are imperative for an accurate assessment. Lots of progress has been made recently on the aforementioned two aspects. Three approaches, a priori classification of sites by regions or typologies, site-specific modeling of expected reference condition and vary ingmetrics in site groups, have been tested in lakes and streams to improve assessment accuracy. All existed studies support that site-specific modeling can efficiently account for natural variation and generate a MMI with good performance. However, until now, no strong evidence has shown that diatom/blue-algae typologies are better than regionalization frameworks on accounting for natural variation either in lakes or in streams. To separate the natural variation explained by site specific modeling from that of varying metrics is necessary for a thorough and accurate evaluation on the valuableness of site-grouping by typologies. Different performance of varying metrics among site groups of streams and lakes was most probably caused by the lack of representativeness of diatom metrics on biological condition rather than the complex multi-stressor gradients in streams and rivers. A recent study showed that blue-green algae enhanced performance of diatom-based MMI on defining lake condition under high level of human disturbance. On the other hand, with more and more extensive and intensive use of statistics techniques in developing MMI, we also discussed some statistical challenges faced by scientists in field of ecological assessment, especially on setting significance level of a statistical test and multiple comparison issue in MMI performance comparison.

AB  - The plant uncoupling mitochondrial protein (PUMP) and the plant mitochondrial potassium channel (PmitoK(ATP)) are two recently discovered energy-dissipating systems present in plant mitochondria, which may play a role as defence systems under environmental stress. To verify whether hyperosmotic stress affects the two dissipating systems in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.), their functioning was studied in early etiolated seedlings maintained under moderate and severe salt (NaCl) and osmotic (mannitol) stress. As measures of mitochondrial stress mitochondrial integrity, membrane potential maintenance and oxygen uptake coupled with ATP synthesis during succinate and proline oxidation were investigated. Both PUMP and PmitoK(ATP) were activated under stress conditions. Activation was clearly evident even under moderate stress when proline oxidation was inhibited, although mitochondrial integrity and succinate oxidation were still unaffected. Under severe stress, which significantly affected all the tested indicators of mitochondrial integrity and functionality, PUMP and PmitoK(ATP) activation was further enhanced. Interestingly, both systems were activated by reactive oxygen species and were able to control mitochondrial superoxide anion production. These results suggest that PUMP and PmitoK(ATP) serve as early antioxidant defence systems in response to hyperosmotic stress and that they are involved in a prolonged response to stress.

AB  - The interaction between wellbore cement and CO2 has the potential to alter cement properties and form preferential leakage pathways during geological carbon sequestration. This work investigates changes in wellbore cement integrity during continuous flooding of CO2-saturated brine. We created composite cement-sandstone core samples with a continuous gap in the cement zone in order to represent defects such as fractures and voids in wellbore cement. Volumetric and structural changes in the cement zone were monitored and quantified using X-ray Micro-Computed Tomography imaging. During an 8 day dynamic flow-through period, the fracture/void aperture increased significantly, whereas the host sandstone remained unaltered. The void volume increased at a faster rate in the early stage of the flow-through period than it did toward the end of the period. Compared to the apertures close to the core outlet, those located near the core inlet experienced more severe cement degradation, accompanied by a decrease in specific surface area, constituting evidence of a smoothing effect. Contrary to previous observations of the self-healing behavior of cement fractures, the in situ permeability on a parallel experiment increased by a factor of 8 after 10 days of flooding. Findings from this work will provide valuable insights applicable to the development of predictive models and for risk assessment under conditions relevant to CO2 sequestration.

AB  - The influence of environmental factors on the diversity of macroinvertebrates was studied in the wetlands of the Gilgel Abay River (GAR) catchment in Ethiopia. The study was done between September 2017 and March 2018, encompassing both wet and dry seasons. Six study wetlands from the GAR catchment were selected in a targeted manner based on the surrounding land use, exposure to anthropogenic disturbances and accessibility to conduct a quantitative study. The relationships between biological and environmental variables were evaluated by using multivariate analyses. Altogether, 36 families of macroinvertebrates were identified. Macroinvertebrate diversity indices were significantly higher at less impaired sites, compared with more impaired sites. Several families of Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Trichoptera taxa, including Corduliidae, Calopterygidae, Baetidae, Aeshnidae, Polymitarcyidae, Hydropsychidae, Heptageniidae, Polycentrapodidae, Hydroptilidae and Philopotamidae were negatively correlated with organic and inorganic pollutants and human disturbances and might be considered as potential indicators of less impaired sites. Conversely, the families Chironomidae, Hirudinidae and Libellulidae were positively correlated with biological oxygen demand, ammonium and human disturbance score and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. Generally, results of macroinvertebrate diversity and composition in this study indicate poor ecological condition of the wetlands, particularly those adjacent to agricultural and urban areas.

AB  - 1. The ecological status of floodplain areas along the Austrian section of the Danube was assessed by an approach based on dragonfly surveys. Although this river section contains a relatively high portion of the river-type-specific alluvial floodplain areas, most of them are influenced by river regulation and damming.
   2. A key element of the assessment procedure, which is oriented towards the new EC Water Framework Directive, is the Odonate Habitat Index.
   3. Classification of ecological status is based on the comparison between the status quo and reference conditions derived from a historical situation minimally influenced by human activities.
   4. Data from 408 sites from 14 investigation areas were used. Ten of the 14 areas were ranked in class II ('good ecological status') within the five-tiered system, which is the level of ecological status targeted in the directive. One area corresponds to the reference condition (class I, 'high ecological status'), and three areas do not meet the quality objective (class III, 'moderate ecological status'). A total of 49 species were found along the whole section, which represents 82% of the river-typespecific reference list. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - State water-quality professionals developing new biological assessment methods often have difficulty relating assessment results to narrative criteria in water-quality standards. An alternative to selecting index thresholds arbitrarily is to include the Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) in the development of the assessment method. The BCG describes tiers of biological community condition to help identify and communicate the position of a water body along a gradient of water quality ranging from natural to degraded. Although originally developed for fish and macroinvertebrate communities of streams and rivers, the BCG is easily adapted to other habitats and taxonomic groups. We developed a discriminant analysis model with stream algal data to predict attainment of tiered aquatic-life uses in Maine's water-quality standards. We modified the BCG framework for Maine stream algae, related the BCG tiers to Maine's tiered aquatic-life uses, and identified appropriate algal metrics for describing BCG tiers. Using a modified Delphi method, 5 aquatic biologists independently evaluated algal community metrics for 230 samples from streams and rivers across the state and assigned a BCG tier (1-6) and Maine water quality class (AA/A, B, C, nonattainment of any class) to each sample. We used minimally disturbed reference sites to approximate natural conditions (Tier 1). Biologist class assignments were unanimous for 53% of samples, and 42% of samples differed by 1 class. The biologists debated and developed consensus class assignments. A linear discriminant model built to replicate a priori class assignments correctly classified 95% of 150 samples in the model training set and 91% of 80 samples in the model validation set. Locally derived metrics based on BCG taxon tolerance groupings (e. g., sensitive, intermediate, tolerant) were more effective than were metrics developed in other regions. Adding the algal discriminant model to Maine's existing macroinvertebrate discriminant model will broaden detection of biological impairment and further diagnose sources of impairment. The algal discriminant model is specific to Maine, but our approach of explicitly tying an assessment tool to tiered aquatic-life goals is widely transferrable to other regions, taxonomic groups, and waterbody types.

AB  - The intensification of agricultural practices is impacting on Piedmont streams in Patagonia and concern exists regarding the integrity of aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated changes in water quality, habitat and riparian condition, and macroinvertebrate community attributes at three small streams during high- and low-water periods. The upper reaches of streams consisted of well-conserved riparian forest where agricultural impact was minimal, while different production systems affected lower stream-reaches. Significant changes in water quality were indicated by increases in nutrient levels, conductivity, total suspended solids, and bacteria (E. coli) at spatial scale. These were mostly associated with livestock, pasture, and horticulture production, though the most severe impacts on in-stream habitat and riparian ecosystem occurred at sites with livestock productions. A gradient of disturbance was highlighted by Canonical Community Ordination and macroinvertebrates were grouped accordingly. Among the metrics measured, EPT richness, number of insect families, density of tolerant taxa, abundance of collector-gatherers, and total invertebrate density displayed significant responses to water quality. The overriding stressor explaining community changes with regard to intolerant taxa (EPT) was ammonium. Mitigation measures should be directed towards reducing livestock intrusion on streams and riparian areas, maintenance and restoration of buffer zones, and regulation of application of fertilizers.

AB  - Certain lowland streams have experienced prehistorical and historical cycles of aggradation, occlusion, degradation, headward incision, and renewed aggradation. Historical cycles appear to be related to human activities. A case study is presented of the Yalobusha River in Mississippi with emphasis on the effects of blockage and removal on aquatic habitats and fish. The adjacent Skuna River, which was channelized;and unblocked, was used in space for time substitution to infer effects of blockage removal on the Yalobusha. Variables describing physical aquatic habitat and fish were sampled from three groups of river reaches: unblocked channelized, channelized and blocked, and naturally sinuous. Fish collections were used to compute six indicators of ecological integrity. At baseflow, mean water depths were an order of magnitude lower in the unblocked channelized stream than for the others. In-channel aquatic habitat volume per unit valley length was 5, 85, and 283 m(3)/m for the channelized, blocked channelized, and natural reaches, respectively. Mean values for all six ecological indicators were lowest for the channelized group. Species richness was greatest for the channelized blocked reach. The ecological indicators displayed gradients in response to the range of observed physical conditions. Management of corridors susceptible to the cycle described above should involve a blend of measures designed to conserve higher quality habitats.

AB  - The challenge of restoring watersheds in arid regions often requires the development of novel scientific tools to guide management. The Walker Basin Program was created to reverse ecological decline in an arid, endorheic watershed through scientifically guided restoration. As part of this programme, 3years of benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected seasonally at 10 sites that represent the diversity of river environments from the high-mountain headwaters to a desert terminal lake. Samples were analysed to quantify baseline conditions in reference and degraded reaches of river and identify opportunities and constraints for aquatic community restoration. Naturally harsh environments in the lower river characterized by high temperatures and low base flow combined with a weak understanding of reference conditions to limit the utility of commonly used indices for quantifying biotic integrity. A flexible approach was employed using a combination of indicator species analysis, cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and community tolerance indices to evaluate the variation of benthic macroinvertebrate community composition across a set of environmental gradients. Results demonstrate that benthic communities in the watershed are primarily influenced by a longitudinal gradient related to elevation. A strong secondary community gradient caused by anthropogenic nutrient loading may constrain restoration effectiveness in some parts of the watershed. Restoration activities should improve water quality conditions and initially target areas of the watershed less affected by nutrient loading. Results also demonstrate that benthic communities shift longitudinally. These shifts should be monitored to inform adaptive management of restoration actions.

AB  - The fish fauna of many lowland streams does not achieve the good ecological status owing to a complex of various historical and present stressors. Hydromorphological degradations are frequently considered to exert negative impacts on the ecological integrity in particular for fish. In this paper, statistical relationships between fish assemblages in the lower trout region and hydromorphological variables in lowland streams of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, are analysed.
   Several variables of channel form, adjacent landuse, instream structures, and bottom substrates indicated hydromorphological degradation and proved to influence fish assemblages. Riparian softwood forests and large variability in water depth were positive structural indicators of biological integrity in fish. Negative indicators comprised intensive use as grassland, a high portion of mud in bottom substrates, riverbed incision, excessively widened channel profiles, and excessive portions of sand in substrates of smaller streams. Species richness correlated significantly with habitat volume, but not with area and length of the sampled stretches. The assessment of fish assemblages by the German fish-biological classification system (fiBS) rendered plausible results that were in a complex relationship with hydromorphological conditions. The moderate quality class was most variable in terms of fish assemblage composition and morphological degradations. Finally, recommendations for restoration measures are given based on the findings of this analysis.

AB  - Benthic indices are typically developed independently by habitat, making their incorporation into large geographic scale assessments potentially problematic because of scaling inequities. A potential solution is to establish common scaling using expert best professional judgment (BPJ). To test if experts from different geographies agree on condition assessment, sixteen experts from four regions in USA and Europe were provided species-abundance data for twelve sites per region. They ranked samples from best to worst condition and classified samples into four condition (quality) categories. Site rankings were highly correlated among experts, regardless of whether they were assessing samples from their home region. There was also good agreement on condition category, though agreement was better for samples at extremes of the disturbance gradient. The absence of regional bias suggests that expert judgment is a viable means for establishing a uniform scale to calibrate indices consistently across geographic regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Visual-based rapid assessment techniques provide an efficient method for characterizing the restoration potential of streams, with many focusing on channel stability and instream habitat features. Few studies, however, have compared these techniques to see if they result in differing restoration priorities. Three rapid assessment techniques were contrasted at three wild trout streams in western New York with different amounts of channel disturbance. Two methods focused only on geomorphic stability, whereas the third addressed physical habitat condition. Habitat assessment scores were not correlated with scores for either geomorphic assessment method and they varied more between channels with different degrees of disturbance. A model based on dynamic equilibrium concepts best explains the variation among the streams and techniques because it accounts for a stream's capacity to maintain ecological integrity despite some inherent instability. Geomorphic indices can serve as effective proxies for biological indices in highly disturbed systems. Yet, this may not be the case in less disturbed systems, where geomorphic indices cannot differentiate channel adjustments that impact biota from those that do not. Dynamically stable streams can include both stable and unstable reaches locally as characterized by geomorphic methods and translating these results into restoration priorities may not be appropriate if interpretations are limited to the reach scale.

AB  - The most widespread pressure impacting river ecological status is the degradation of key hydromorphologic elements, such as sediment type and flow rate. However, almost nothing is known about the quantitative relationship between benthic invertebrate abundance and these elements. This synthesis compiles quantitative data on physical requirements and thresholds for invertebrates relative to two hydromorphologic factors: substrate size and hydraulic energy (measured as shear stress). Both factors are commonly a focus of river rehabilitation. However, we found only limited literature data that we could use to identify invertebrate preferences (189 taxa). Preferred substrate sizes of all stream epifauna we examined varied between 0.05 and 400mm and they prefer shear stresses from 0.13 to 3.67Nm(-2). There was no difference in variation of preferred conditions between the examined taxonomic levels. We suspect that taxa preferring hydraulic environments with shear stresses<0.64Nm(-2) are affected more by environmental factors than solely being constrained by substrate or hydraulic energy preferences. Such taxa might be useful as sensitive indicator species for evaluating stream integrity. Hence, to optimize restoration success for riverine biota, hydromorphological forces should be mitigated by manipulating habitat complexity in a way that it enhances intact ecological processes.

AB  - Biological monitoring uses assemblage structure to assess condition of ecological systems. Taxa that effectively integrate impacts within the system of interest are useful for biological monitoring, whereas taxa that do not demonstrate predictable responses can provide ambiguous or misleading indicators. We compared the effectiveness of aquatic plant and fish assemblages for biological monitoring in 16 small lakes (< 80 ha). The lakes were limnologically similar but differed in extent of lakeshore development and type of watershed land-cover. Linear regression analysis revealed that the quality of the aquatic plant community declined with increasing lakeshore development (number of dwellings per km of shoreline), which is the primary source of impacts within this group of northern Wisconsin lakes. As lakeshore development increased, we observed a decrease in the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) of a lake, number of plant species per take, number of highly intolerant plant species per lake, and the species richness and frequency of occurrence of floating vegetation. Conversely, fish species richness, centrarchid species richness, number of small benthic fish species, intolerant fish species richness and the proportion of the total catch of intolerant and vegetative-dwelling fish were not related to lakeshore development. These results indicate that, within the range of conditions observed, aquatic plant communities are more sensitive to lakeshore development than fish communities. Neither aquatic plant species composition nor fish assemblage variables were correlated with watershed land cover types; however all the watersheds were relatively small and undisturbed. In small lakes with few fish species, aquatic plants can be used as biological indicators for monitoring ecological conditions.

AB  - States may protect coral reefs using biological water quality standards outlined by the Clean Water Act. This requires biological assessments with indicators sensitive to human disturbance and regional, probability-based survey designs. Stony coral condition was characterized on a regional scale for the first time in the nearshore waters of the US Virgin Islands (USVI). Coral composition, abundance, size, and health were assessed at 66 stations in the St. Croix region in fall 2007 and at 63 stations in the St. Thomas and St. John region in winter 2009. Indicators were chosen for their sensitivity to human disturbance. Both surveys were probability-based (random) designs with station locations preselected from areas covered by hardbottom and coral reef substrate. Taxa richness was as high as 21 species but more than half the area of both regions exhibited taxa richness of < 10 species in the 25 m(2) transect area. Coral density was as high as 5 colonies m(-2) but more than half the area of both regions had < 2 colonies m(-2). Both regions showed similar dominant species based on frequency of occurrence and relative abundance. Because of large colony sizes, Montastrea annularis provided more total surface area and live surface area than more abundant species. The surveys establish baseline regional conditions and provide a foundation for long-term regional monitoring envisioned by the USVI Department of Planning and Natural Resources. The probabilistic sampling design assures the data can be used in Clean Water Act reporting.

AB  - Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) play an important role in almost all undisturbed freshwater communities and their larvae frequently form a considerable part of the material sampled during biomonitoring procedures. Mayfly taxa are widely accepted as bioindicators for water quality and form an integral part of standardized systems for the saprobic evaluation of running waters. Nevertheless, successful interpretation of data depends heavily on sampling strategies and the technical concepts adopted therein. The following paper discusses current problems affecting the correct assessment of mayfly community structure and proposes basic requirements to improve the meaningfulness of limnological routine sampling with regard to Ephemeroptera. The topics covered include: mayfly diversity in different types of freshwater communities in Europe; natural habitats and sampling sites/sampling strategies; life cycles and minimum sampling frequency; level of identification and interpretation of data.

AB  - Testate amoebae are common proxies of past hydrological conditions in peatlands and are increasingly used as indicators of ecosystems ecological integrity. The ecology of these microorganisms is relatively well documented in non-forested ombrotrophic peatlands but there is a lack of data from forested peatlands, which are important ecosystems in boreal regions. This study provides the first testate amoebae modem training set (n = 72) from forested peatlands of the James Bay lowlands, eastern Canada. The relationships between testate amoeba communities and environmental variables (pH, water table depth, canopy openness, mineral particles concentration) were investigated using canonical correspondence analyses. Our data have shown that testate amoebae are sensitive environmental indicators in forested peatlands and can be used to reconstruct past hydrological conditions for these environments. A transfer function for water table depth (WTD) reconstructions was developed using weighted averaging models and was tested on a fossil testate amoebae record. In comparing forested and non-forested peatlands datasets we have shown that testate amoebae occupy similar ecological niches with respect to surface wetness in both ecosystems, but that their WTD optima is much higher (drier) in forested peatlands. The results show that the diversity and composition of testate amoeba assemblages do not vary significantly at the microform scale. This study provides new knowledge on testate amoebae ecology in forested peatlands that will improve further transfer function development in peatland ecosystems. This will allow a better evaluation of the responses of boreal forested peatlands to climate change, ecological disturbances and human activities.

AB  - Tens of thousands of stream kilometers worldwide are degraded by a legacy of acid loads, high metal concentrations, and altered habitat caused by acid mine drainage (AMD) from abandoned underground and surface mines. As the primary production base in streams, the condition of algal-dominated periphyton communities is particularly important to nutrient cycling, energy flow, and higher trophic levels. Here, we synthesize current knowledge regarding how AMD-associated stressors affect (i) algal communities and their use as ecological indicators, (ii) their functional roles in stream ecosystems, and (iii) how these findings inform management decisions and evaluation of restoration effectiveness. A growing body of research has found ecosystem simplification caused by AMD stressors. Species diversity declines, productivity decreases, and less efficient nutrient uptake and retention occur as AMD severity increases. New monitoring approaches, indices of biological condition, and attributes of algal community structure and function effectively assess AMD severity and effectiveness of management practices. Measures of ecosystem processes, such as nutrient uptake rates, extracellular enzyme activities, and metabolism, are increasingly being used as assessment tools, but remain in their infancy relative to traditional community structure-based approaches. The continued development, testing, and implementation of functional measures and their use alongside community structure metrics will further advance assessments, inform management decisions, and foster progress toward restoration goals. Algal assessments will have important roles in making progress toward improving and sustaining the water quality, ecological condition, and ecosystem services of streams in regions affected by the legacy of unregulated coal mining.

AB  - Population growth and economic development have resulted in increased water demands, threatening freshwater resources. In riverine ecosystems, continuous monitoring of the river quality is needed to follow up on their ecological condition in the light of water pollution and habitat degradation. However, in many parts of the world, such monitoring is lacking, and ecological indicators have not been defined. In this study, we assessed seasonal variation in benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in a tropical river catchment in northeastern Tanzania, which currently experiencing an increase in agricultural activities. We examined the potential of in-stream environmental variables and land-use patterns to predict the river macroinvertebrate assemblages, and also identified indicator taxa linked to specific water quality conditions. Macroinvertebrate abundance, taxon richness and TARISS (Tanzania River Scoring System) score were higher in the dry season most likely due to higher surface runoff from agricultural land and poorer water quality in the wet season. In the wet season macro invertebrates seem to be limited by chlorophyll-a, oxygen and phosphorous while in the dry season, when water flow is lower, nitrogen and turbidity become important. Substrate composition was important in both seasons. Given the fact that different selective filters limit macroinvertebrate assemblages in both seasons, a complete picture of water quality can only be established by monitoring in both seasons. Riparian buffer zones may help to alleviate some of the observed negative effects of agricultural activities on the river system in the wet season while limiting irrigation return flows may increase water quality in the dry season.

AB  - We developed a multimetric index based on macroinvertebrates to assess ecological condition of wadeable streams in Rio de Janeiro State, southeast Brazil. To do so we used a set of 12 reference and 12 severely impaired sites sampled in the summer wet season as calibration sites. Nine metrics were selected based on their abilities to distinguish between reference and impaired sites and their independence from other metrics. Metrics retained in the final index were: family richness; Trichoptera family richness; Shannon family diversity; % Plecoptera individuals; % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) individuals; %mollusk and Diptera individuals; %shredder individuals; proportion Chironomidae/Diptera individuals; and proportion Hydropsychidae/Trichoptera individuals. The final 9 metrics were standardized; then the Guapiacu-Macau Multimetric Index (GMMI) was calculated, yielding a final index score ranging from 0 to 100. We validated the index through use of 19 sites subject to different levels of impairment, sampled both in summer and in winter. Our final multimetric index distinguished well between different levels of impairment and was strongly correlated with other disturbance measures. Temporal stability was also tested through use of 8 sites that were sampled in both seasons, and results showed no significant changes in the index final score among seasons. Our research represents one of the first initiatives in Brazil to develop a multimetric index for use in a spatially extensive bioassessment program extending across substantial natural and disturbance gradients. It can be a useful tool to help conserve streams in Atlantic forest conservation areas. We suggest that the methodology established here offers a foundation for similar index development and assessments in Brazil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aquatic insects are bioindicators of water quality. Their structure and species composition is used in assessing the ecological integrity of streams and rivers. Their composition and density of the upper Warri River, Niger Delta, Nigeria were assessed and the influence of different physical and chemical variables on their distribution was explored at three designated stations. A total of 57 taxa were recorded with station 2 accounting for the greatest Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) richness. Abundance of the aquatic insects was affected by the nature of the substrate, macrophytes and canopy cover at the various stations examined. Generally, the upper Warri River is a fairly clean water body rich in EPT organisms. Pollution tolerant insect taxa such as chironomids and culicids larvae were only sporadically present.

AB  - There are concerns that many national parks and protected areas worldwide are ineffective at protecting biological diversity and ecosystem processes, are socially unjust in their relations with Indigenous communities, or both. This paper outlines what we believe are the key criteria and indicators for evaluating social equity and ecological integrity in terrestrial national parks and protected areas. These criteria and indicators were developed through: (1) a detailed review of relevant literature; (2) a pilot analysis of the management plans and management direction statements from 14 national and provincial parks in Canada, Australia, and South Africa (countries with robust and extensive national parks systems and which share a common legacy of land dispossession followed by the subsequent pursuit of land claims by disadvantaged groups); and (3) an in-depth case study examination of six national parks.

AB  - This review provides a broad conceptual overview of different approaches to measuring marine ecosystem condition and guidance for framework development (particularly relevant for developing countries). The objectives were to review definitions of ecosystem condition and identify the core approaches and key challenges within the research area. Furthermore, we reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of different indicators that can be used for condition assessments. A semi-systematic approach drawing from more than 300 studies covering a broad range of methods was followed.
   Generally, definitions of ecosystem condition are based on known changes to the ecosystem, but ultimately, they should align with the definition of an ecosystem and consider ecosystem structure and functioning. As far as possible, the definition should relate an observed state to a reference condition or ecological target. Importantly, definitions of condition should be practical, scalable and always provided when conducting condition assessments.
   Five indicator categories were identified including pressures, physical parameters, biological structure, functional structure and ecological models. Indicators mostly focus on drivers of change (i.e. ex situ pressures) or the structure of the ecosystem, as these data are easier to obtain. While valuable, these classes of indicators can only provide an indirect appraisal of ecosystem functioning in instances where the relationship between pressure, structure and functioning are known. Indicators that measure structure and functioning of an ecosystem can be used to directly report on condition; however, the data (and monitoring) requirements make them impractical in most instances. Ideally, integrated assessments, that measure indicators from all indicator categories, should be prioritised to provide a comprehensive overview of condition. However, this often requires transdisciplinary collaboration, substantial research capacity (and associated funding) and time to collect the necessary data. An alternative is to select a few strategic indicators that can provide data to address the definition of ecosystem condition and at the same time provide a feasible approach to address the project specific research objectives. Where possible, a data-derived approach should be followed as in situ measurements have potential to improve the understanding of impacts of anthropogenic pressures on ecosystem functioning, and in turn facilitate better management of human activities and enhance ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Halberg, N. 2012. Assessment of the environmental sustainability of organic farming: Definitions, indicators and the major challenges. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 981-996. The debate over agricultural sustainability continues due to the challenges of reducing externalities of intensive farming methods and preserving vital natural capital, but many definitions of sustainability are too wide to allow for a prioritized assessment. This paper uses a more narrow definition of agricultural sustainability focusing on the functional integrity of a system to highlight specific aspects of vital importance for the long-term resilience and reproducibility of agricultural systems. Key areas of resource sufficiency are also identified. Based on a review of scientific literature the relative sustainability of organic agriculture is assessed with a focus on environmental impact and resource use in Europe and North America. While there are many examples of organic agriculture with improved performance in terms of soil fertility and preservation of biodiversity, in other aspects - such as resource use per kilogram product - the difference to conventional farming is less important. The paper presents a framework for selection of indicators based on the principles of organic agriculture which may be used to monitor and improve the performance of organic agriculture with respect to functional integrity and resource sufficiency. The differences between comparable organic farms may be used for improving farm practices through a benchmarking process.

AB  - Selecting sites for river restoration projects or performing ex post evaluation must be done in ecoregions with comparable biological integrity. Moreover, to evaluate the integrity of a river ecosystem that varies from the headwater to downstream regions, adjustments of the ecoregion according to the longitudinal change in biota must be made. We defined regions where biota are identical according to the direction of change along the stream path as "segment-based ecoregions." We delineated segment-based ecoregions using fish fauna data for two ecoregions in Japan: the northeast Kyushu, and south Kyushu. The northeast Kyushu ecoregion was divided into three segment-based ecoregions, and south Kyushu ecoregion into five segment-based ecoregions. Classifying fish fauna within the same ecoregion enables classification by differences in the longitudinal change in the stream path rather than by differences in watersheds. Specific topographic regions such as the amphitheater areas of the south Kyushu ecoregion was classified as independent segment-based ecoregions. We further defined indicator fish species for each segment based ecoregion. Indicator fish species reflected the fish fauna of each ecoregion in the midstream area, such as migratory Go biidae of the south Kyushu ecoregion. Applying the segment-based ecoregion concept helps compare the biological integrity of fish fauna depending on a common environmental type between watersheds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid field assessment indicators of ecological stress and disturbance may or may not reflect actual biological conditions. We tested the ability of rapidly assessed buffer quality to predict and classify wetland floristic quality across 106 sites in Oklahoma, USA. We used buffer zone metrics from a national-level rapid assessment tool (USA-RAM) to evaluate applicability at the state level. The rapid assessment relying on buffer quality did not relate predictably (linearly) with floristic quality, but the relationship improved after ecoregional stratification. Focusing on the Central Great Plains ecoregion with 55 wetlands sampled, we found 16 floristically intact sites and 13 floristically altered sites based on multivariate testing of the Floristic Quality Assessment Index and several component metrics. Distributions of buffer metrics across these sites were similar between the floristically intact and altered classes, suggesting potential for misclassification of wetland biological condition using rapid buffer assessment. Some of the disconnect may be attributed to bias in the buffer measurements and to using a national assessment protocol at the state level. Buffer metrics in the USA-RAM may offer little insight about wetland biological condition in some regions, and the use of such metrics should only complement direct bioassessments and not substitute for them.

AB  - In this study, we explain the importance of treatment integrity by listing and exploring state standards for service providers of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrator programs across the United States. The overall expectations of batterer intervention programs (BIPs) will be discussed as we compare and contrast the Duluth Model with evidence-based practice. Expectations of treatment efficacy will be explored from the stance of the professional code of ethics and ethical practice. The context for this article is inspired by the following issues: (a) mental health professionals' ethical obligations to clients and to standards of practice; (b) the value of treatment integrity; (c) expectations regarding program efficacy; (d) the nature of court-mandated batterer intervention programs. Potential ethical concerns that are explored include: failure to consider and utilize research evidence, failure to ensure treatment integrity, inadequate assessment/diagnosis, failure to connect assessment to treatment, using a diagnosis on a client not identified in the DSM-V, giving a diagnosis without proper credentials or evaluation of the client, and imploring a homogeneous approach to a complex behavior.

AB  - Within the scope of the European Union Water Framework Directive, diatom assemblages as biological quality components were used to evaluate the ecological status of 12 surface waters in the Araban-Yavuzeli catchment between October 2013 and October 2014. A total of 75 diatom species were identified during the study period. Amphora ovalis, Denticula elegans, Gomphonema parvulum, Gomphonema truncatum, and Navicula cryptocephala were commonly observed. The relationship between diatom assemblages and environmental factors was assessed by canonical correspondence analysis and weighted average regression. Dissolved oxygen, temperature, nitrate, biological oxygen demand, lead, and copper played significant roles in the distribution and composition of diatom assemblages (P < 0.05). The ecological status of the stations in Araban and Yavuzeli was characterized using the trophic index-Turkey (TIT), trophic index (TI), and eutrophication and/or pollution index-diatom (EPI-D) indices. According to the TIT, Ardi1 Creek1 had very good ecological conditions and was characterized by the occurrence of pollution-sensitive diatom taxa (e.g., Cymbella affinis, Encyonema silesiacum, Navicula radiosa), indicated by multivariate analyses. The significant positive correlation of the TIT (P < 0.01, r = 0.789) with logPO(4) indicated that TIT may be used as an appropriate diatom metric to assess the ecological status of surface waters in the Araban-Yavuzeli catchment.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, aquatic organisms are used as bio-indicators to assess ecological water quality in western regions, but have hardly been used in an Iranian context. We, therefore, evaluated the suitability of several indices to assess the water quality for an Iranian case study.
   Methods: Measured data on biotic (fish and macroinvertebrates) and abiotic elements (28 physicochemical and habitat parameters), were used to calculate six indices for assessment of water quality and the impact of human activities in the Tajan river, Iran. GIS, uni- and multivariate statistics were used to assess the correlations between biological and environmental endpoints.
   Results: The results showed that ecological condition and water quality were reduced from up-to downstream. The reduced water quality was revealed by the biotic indices better than the abiotic ones which were linked to a variety of ecological water quality scales.
   Conclusion: The fish index showed a strong relationship with long-term database of physicochemical parameters (12 years (94%)), whereas macroinvertebrates index is more correlated with short-term data (76%). Meanwhile, the biotic and abiotic elements in this study were also classified well by PCA. Pulp and wood plants and sand mining are indicated to have the most negative effects on the river ecosystem.

AB  - Biomonitoring is a common means of evaluating wetlands. It is based on the premise that the community composition of one taxonomic group is indicative of overall biology and the underlying environmental conditions at a wetland. To be a good bioindicator, there must be adequate concordance between the indicator group and other biotic assemblages. Otherwise, multi-assemblage monitoring is necessary to glean a complete picture of wetland condition. In 32 sites ranging from reference wetlands to stormwater retention ponds, we evaluated concordance in community composition among the six most commonly monitored wetland assemblages: waterfowl, wetland dependent songbirds. aquatic macroinvertebrates, and plants in the wet meadow, emergent, and open-water vegetation zones. We also assessed agreement in environmental correlates among these six assemblages and investigated the impact of human disturbance on cross-assemblage concordance. We found that cross-assemblage concordance was positive (p < 0.03 in 14 of 15 pair-wise comparisons, p = 0.06 in 15th case), but relatively low (Mantel R values 0.11-0.37), suggesting that the assemblages are mediocre surrogates for one another. Yet, we found very strong agreement among environmental correlates of the six assemblages, especially along the first axis of assemblage-specific ordinations (mean Spearman rho = 0.923), indicating that despite low concordance, the six assemblages are likely responding to the same environmental gradients. Thus, while a single assemblage may not serve as a surrogate for the other assemblages, it should yield an adequate estimate of underlying environmental conditions and the degree of disturbance. Most important among the environmental correlates were sediment and water nutrient levels, shoreline slope, and the size of wet meadow and emergent vegetation zones. Perhaps most interestingly, we found that the strength of cross-assemblage concordance was greatest in reference wetlands and was lower (p < 0.05) in constructed wetlands. This implies that cross-assemblage concordance present in undisturbed sites may not persist in disturbed wetlands where several of these cross-assemblage relationships deteriorate. Furthermore, a general change in cross-assemblage concordance may itself be indicative of human disturbance in wetlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A key challenge to environmental flow assessment in many rivers is to evaluate how much of the discharge flow should be retained in the river in order to maintain the integrity and valued features of riverine ecosystems. With the increasing impact of climate change and human activities on riverine ecosystems, the natural flow regime paradigm in many rivers has become non-stationary conditions, which is a new challenge to the assessment of environmental flow. This study presents a useful framework to (1) detect change points in runoff time series using two statistical methods (Mann-Kendall test method and heuristic segmentation method), (2) adjust data of the changed period against the original flow series into a stationary condition using a procedure of reconstruction; and (3) incorporate inter- and intra-annual streamflow variability with adjusted streamflow to evaluate environmental flow. The Jialing to Han inter-basin water transfer project was selected as the case study. Results indicate that a change point of 1994 was identified, revealing that the stationarity of annual streamflow series is invalid. The variations of reconstructed streamflow series are roughly consistent with original streamflow series, especially in the maximum/minimum values and rise/fall rates, but the mean value of reconstructed streamflow series is increased. The reconstructed streamflow series would further serve to eliminate the non-stationary of original streamflow, and incorporating the inter- and intra-annual variability would upgrade the ecosystem fitness. Selecting different criteria for the conservation of riverine ecosystems can have significantly different consequences, and we should not focus on the protection of specific objectives that will inevitably affect other aspects. This study provides a useful framework for environmental flow assessment and can be applied to a wide range of instream flow management approaches to protect the riverine ecosystem.

AB  - Headwater streams are facing increasing disturbances from human pressures worldwide, thus better knowledge about bioindicators, particularly aquatic insect responses to various pressures and stressors, are urgently needed. Multiple trait-based approaches consider species attributes filtered by the environment, allowing them to persist in ecosystems under environmental pressures. Because this approach has been minimally explored in Odonata larvae, we aimed to understand how anthropogenic stressors structure Odonata larval assemblages in neotropical savanna streams by using multiple trait-based approaches. We hypothesized that a set of stressors-such as reduced substrate heterogeneity, poor water quality, natural land cover converted to pasture and agriculture, and reduced local riparian canopy cover-select Odonata functional traits. We collected 3209 Odonata larvae from 186 neotropical savanna headwater stream sites and used 39 environmental variables and seven traits in 23 categories related to their functional roles in Odonata genera. To assess associations between trait categories and environmental variables, we applied RLQ and fourth-corner statistical analyses. We found strong relationships between environmental variables and sets of Odonata biological traits that were separated into two main groups. Zygoptera genera (Perilestes, Allopodagrion, Heliocharis, Argia, Epipleoneura, Mnesarete/Hetaerina, Psaironeura) have elongated body shapes, caudal lamellae respiration, conforming thermoregulation, and endophytic oviposition. Such traits favor assemblages in conditions similar to reference streams, including denser riparian vegetation, good water quality, and diverse flows and substrate. Therefore, they are more sensitive to changes in those conditions. On the other hand, Anisoptera genera (Gomphoides, Archaeogomphus, Macrothemis, Brechmorhoga, Gynothemis, Phyllocycla) have cylindrical body shapes, internal gill respiration, endothermic thermoregulation, and burrowing behavior. Those traits facilitate their survival in intermediate or disturbed stream sites, characterized by riparian deforestation, increased erosion and siltation, and higher levels of total dissolved solids and conductivity. Therefore, using Odonata larval traits can be a valuable tool for assessing and monitoring anthropogenic impacts on neotropical savanna streams.

AB  - We developed empirical models for fish, macroinvertebrate, and diatom assemblages to assess the biological condition of 268 streams sampled from 1993 to 2002 in 7 major river basins in the Appalachian region of the USA. These models estimate the expected taxonomic composition at each site based on observed variation in taxonomic composition at reference sites. The index, O/E, is the ratio of the number of predicted taxa that were observed (0) to that expected (E) to occur at a site and is a measure of taxonomic completeness. We compared how O/E for each assemblage varied among major landuse settings and whether impaired assemblages were associated with particular physicochemical conditions. We also examined concordance among assemblages in their response to stress. Biological, chemical, and physical data were collected following consistent protocols. We used land-cover criteria, published data, and topographic maps to classify sites by major landuse setting. Fish, macroinvertebrate, and diatom assemblages had been sampled at 73, 108, and 52, respectively, of the least disturbed sites used to establish reference conditions. The models accounted for a substantial portion of the natural variation in taxonomic composition across sites that was associated with biogeographic, climatic, and basin-scale factors and generally were unbiased across the range of environmental gradients observed in the region. Assessments at nonreference sites showed that impairment of fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages was most strongly associated with agriculture and urban land uses, whereas impairment of diatom assemblages was most strongly associated with mining in the basin. Concordance in assessments among assemblages was not strong. Assessments based on 2 assemblages differed in 28 to 57% of cases, and assessments were never concordant for cases where all 3 assemblages were sampled. Furthermore, only 1/2 of these cases would have been assessed as ecologically impaired had only I assemblage been sampled. Differences between observed and predicted frequencies of occurrence for individual taxa were generally consistent with known tolerances to environmental stressors and might aid in identifying causes of biological impairment.

AB  - In this study, we analyse the distribution and species richness of epibenthic and planktonic Cladocera (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) in 62 Uganda crater lakes, spread across the climatic gradient between the sub-humid shoulder and semi-arid floor of the East African Rift Valley. Together, these lakes cover large environmental gradients in salinity, trophic conditions and depth. In total, 36 species of Cladocera were encountered in the freshwater lakes (<1,500 mu S/cm), whereas only a single species was found in the true saline lakes (>10,000 mu S/cm). Cladoceran species richness in individual lakes was found to be determined primarily by the presence of a well-developed littoral belt of submerged and emergent aquatic macrophytes, pH and salinity. The highest species richness occurred in fresh but eutrophic shallow waters, with relatively low pH (6.5-7) and dense aquatic macrophyte growth. As identified by multivariate statistical analysis, the distribution of Cladocera species among the Uganda lakes was most strongly determined by nutrient availability (measured as total phosphorus), the presence and diversity of aquatic macrophyte habitat, pH, mean annual temperature and the fraction of the crater catchment that is currently under agriculture. Since Cladocera play an important role in aquatic food webs, and as such contribute to the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems, an increased understanding of the environmental controls underlying their distribution provides valuable information on aquatic ecosystem functioning needed for management and conservation. The significant turnover of cladoceran species composition along the sampled environmental gradients demonstrates their potential as biological indicators for water quality and ecosystem health in East African lakes. Our results suggest that changes in land use are the greatest threat to natural ecosystem functioning in these African lakes, and particularly so in the shallower lakes.

AB  - Precise prediction of collapse pressure is a key role in structural integrity assessment of piping systems. The present study uses anAl-Al2Cu\documentclass functionally graded (FG) pipe fabricated through horizontal centrifugal casting technique to empirically investigate its mechanical responses under hydrostatic pressure test. The evolutions of deformations correspond to the external surface of the FG pipe in the axial and hoop directions recorded by strain gauges and data acquisition during pressurization are outlined. Moreover, finite element simulation using user subroutine USDFLD implemented into the commercial software ABAQUS is applied to numerically study the tested FG pipe under similar environmental and loading conditions used in the experimental procedure. Eventually, the experimental results reveal that the final internal pressure and corresponding impact energy of the tested FG pipe fails in a brittle manner are 165 bar and 30.4545 KJ, respectively. Moreover, microstructure observations of the fracture surfaces are performed using scanning electron microscope (SEM).

AB  - Water quality and ecological integrity of estuaries closely reflect activities within the entire upstream catchment. Much emphasis has been placed on the response of estuaries to anthropogenic stressors through the use of monitoring programmes. Key to the success of these programmes is the use of indicators, as they transform data into useful information. The aim of this study was to identify the eutrophic condition of selected estuaries along the southern coast of South Africa, using a multi-metric approach to classification. Four permanently open and five temporarily open/closed estuaries were studied. Initially, the daily nutrient loads and flushing time variability were assessed for each estuary. Next, the "state" of the estuaries was determined using a variety of indicators, including: dissolved oxygen, inorganic nutrients (N and P), phytoplankton, epiphytes and microphytobenthos. Specific indicator thresholds, obtained from existing assessment frameworks and literature, enabled an incremental rating of eutrophic condition. Using this approach, an equal number of estuaries were classified as oligotrophic ('Good'), mesotrophic ('Fair') and eutrophic ('Poor'). High daily nutrient loads and/or long flushing times were identified as the primary causes of eutrophic conditions. However, differentiating between naturally and anthropogenically induced symptoms was highlighted as an important consideration in such assessments. This study demonstrated the importance of adopting a holistic and adaptive approach to the assessment of eutrophication in estuaries. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a concept sustainability has captured our imaginations and aspirations. As a tangible and identifiable goal it eludes us. Having developed indicators to measure and monitor economic, social and environmental conditions, we want now to measure sustainability. Our emphasis on the physical, the objective, and the rational, however, sees only the external manifestations of sustainability. The internal manifestations of sustainability, the non-material, the subjective, and the experiential, are put to one side, since they are messy, interpretive and time-consuming-the world of hermeneutics. Sustainability, however, is more than a 'thing' to be measured, since it is about ecological integrity, quality of life and transformation or transcendence. Rather than ask how we can measure sustainability, it may be more appropriate to ask how we measure up to sustainability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anthropogenic stressors, such as urban development and intensification of agricultural and industrial activities, can alter physical, chemical, and biological conditions in aquatic systems. Mounting concern over cumulative effects of multiple stressors has stimulated the need to track ecological responses and quantify degradation. Periphytic diatoms have potential to serve as early indicators of ecological degradation in aquatic systems. We examined relations between periphytic diatom community composition, water chemistry, and the magnitude of anthropogenic stressors in lakes of the Muskoka River watershed. These relations were used to develop a bioassessment framework for tracking changes in biological integrity in a region undergoing growth of tourism and related urban and recreational activities. We examined nearshore periphyton and water-chemistry samples from 86 lakes to assess relations between diatom community composition, water chemistry, and measures of 9 anthropogenic stress ors (e.g., % urban area, % agricultural area, roadway proximity) based on uni- and multivariate numerical methods. Composition of periphytic diatom communities was associated with the concentration of ions from anthropogenic sources (i.e., road salt, dust suppressants). We demonstrated that periphytic diatoms in the nearshore regions of the lakes may be sensitive early warning indicators of ecological change because the most dramatic shift in diatom community composition was observed with modest increases in anthropogenic stressors. This relationship was weaker at sites where natural variation in pH among lakes was high. pH often acts in conjunction with other chemical factors to influence diatom community composition. Thus, we recommend stratifying monitoring efforts to account for confounding natural variation in pH. We anticipate that periphytic diatoms can be used as a powerful indicator of environmental stress in lakes beyond the MRW.

AB  - As an improvement of a previous work [Cabecinha, E., Cortes, R., Cabral, JA., 2004. Performance of a stochastic-dynamic modelling methodology for running waters ecological assessment. Ecol. Modell. 175, 303-317], the present paper examined the applicability of a holistic stochastic-dynamic methodology (StDM) in predicting the tendencies of benthic macroinvertebrate metrics from mountain streams facing expected scenarios either: (1) of pollution increase due to the agricultural intensification; or (2) of farming activity abandonment becoming less pollutant as a non-point source. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which management strategies can be designed. These procedures focus on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as some relevant trophic and taxonomic metrics and changes in local environmental conditions. The dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of environmental changes. The samples of aquatic macroinvertebrate, environmental and physical-chemical data were collected from four watersheds of mountain rivers in Northeast Portugal, between 1983 and 1985. The dynamic model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships between the selected components of the studied watersheds. The model validation was based on independent data from a watershed not included in the model construction. Overall, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to demonstrate the StDM reliability in capturing the stochastic environmental dynamics of the studied aquatic ecosystems facing agricultural scenarios that will characterize the region, namely by predicting credible behavioural patterns for the selected metrics.

AB  - Indicators of ecosystem health are effective tools to assess freshwater ecosystem impairment. However, they are scarcely used as a monitoring tool by local environmental agencies in Argentina. Here, we review the literature to analyze the use of ecosystem health indicators in freshwaters from Argentina. We found 91 scientific articles relating to the use of ecological indices to assess the impact of different environmental stressors in aquatic environments published between 1996 and 2019. We generated Google Earth map where we deployed the sampling sites and type of indices reported by each article. As biological indices were the most used, we also surveyed bioindication experts to gather information on their application. We found that most studies were concentrated mainly in Pampas (34%), Dry Chaco (20%), Espinal (12%), and Patagonian Steppe (10%) ecoregions. Biological indices (mainly with invertebrates) were more used than geomorphological or physico-chemical indices. Indices resulted useful to evaluate the impact of stressors in 63% of cases, being land use the most studied stressor. However, sampling design varied greatly among studies, making their comparison difficult. The information compiled here could help to the design of monitoring protocols, the adoption of regional indices, and the creation of a national inventory of ecosystem health status, which are mandatory to propose well-grounded conservation and management policies for freshwaters in Argentina.

AB  - Patterns of phytoplankton size spectra variation with gradients of environmental stress have been observed in freshwater, transitional waters and marine ecosystems, driving the development of size spectra based assessment tools.
   this study, we have tested on transitional and coastal waters a new Index of Size spectra Sensitivity of Phytoplankton (ISS-Phyto), which integrates simple size spectra metrics, size class sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance, phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and taxonomic richness thresholds. ISS-Phyto has been tested both among and within ecosystems along pressure gradients based on expert view assessment; the adequacy of symmetric and both left and right asymmetric models of phytoplankton size class sensitivity have been compared.
   The results showed that ISS-Phyto consistently discriminated between anthropogenic and natural disturbance conditions. Left asymmetric models of size spectra sensitivity, assuming greater disturbance tolerance with respect to eutrophication and organic enrichment of increasingly large size classes, showed the best fit comparing all ecosystems; in three of the four considered ecosystems (Varna, Helsinki, Mompas-Pasaia), they seemed to discriminate best between different levels of disturbance also within ecosystems. Moreover, they demonstrated significant and inverse patterns of variation along the overall pressure gradient as well as along the inorganic phosphorus (DIP), chlorophyll a and trophic index (TRIX) gradients.
   Therefore. ISS-Phyto, originally developed for transitional waters, seems to be an adequate assessment tool of ecological status also in coastal marine waters; moreover, it seems adequate to describe within ecosystem disturbance gradients. Hence, ISS-Phyto helps to understand the relationships between anthropogenic impact and ecosystem response from the individual point of view, with reference to the simple parameter of body size.

AB  - The Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment (MAHA) included the sampling of macroinvertebrates from 424 wadeable stream sites to determine status and trends, biological conditions, and water quality in first through third order streams in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands Region (MAHR) of the United States in 1993-1995. We identified reference and impaired sites using water chemistry and habitat criteria and evaluated a set of candidate macroinvertebrate metrics using a stepwise process. This process examined several metric characteristics, including ability of metrics to discriminate reference and impaired sites, relative scope of impairment, correlations with chemical and habitat indicators of stream disturbance, redundancy with other metrics, and within-year variability. Metrics that performed well were compared with metrics currently being used by three states in the region: Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Some of the metrics used by these states did not perform well when evaluated using regional data, while other metrics used by all three states in some form, specifically number of taxa, number of EPT taxa, and Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, performed well overall. Reasons for discrepancies between state and regional evaluations of metrics are explored. We also provide a set of metrics that, when used in combination, may provide a useful assessment of stream conditions in the MAHR.

AB  - The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) assessment is a new powerful scheme that identifies ecosystems that are at risk of collapse due to global environmental changes, which can help any mitigation actions aimed at conserving and rescuing these natural ecosystems. The current study applied RLE assessment protocol on Lake Burullus ecosystem, a highly productive wetland ecosystem, Ramsar site and International Bird Area (IBA) of Egypt. A conceptual model of the key ecosystem processes for Burullus wetland was constructed. The application of RLE followed the standard protocol for the first four criteria; (A) declines in distribution, (B) restricted distribution, (C) degradation of the abiotic components, and (D) regarding the assessment of the disruption of biotic processes and interactions. However, data were insufficient for assessing Criterion (E) that entails conducting quantitative estimates of the risk of collapse. Multi-date satellite images were obtained and processed to estimate the changes in the spatial distribution under criteria (A) and (B) of the study area. For evaluating Criteria (C) and (D), long-term data were collected from literature and previous works to cover the time frame of the assessment as much as possible. The results from the RLE assessment revealed that the status of the ecosystem is Critically Endangered (CR), which was attributed to various types of threats that caused degradation of the natural quality and integrity of the ecosystem. Although the RLE assessment provides a coherent approach for identifying ecosystems vulnerable to human-induced changes; data insufficiency can be an impediment for the efficient application of the RLE assessment. Remotely-sensed data can help in derivation of suitable spectral indicators of the status of the ecosystems structure and functioning that might overcome some of the challenges of data adequacy and relevance to the RLE assessment especially for the understudied and data-deficient ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization impacts ecosystems through loss and fragmentation of habitat, loss of diversity, increase in runoff, and contaminant discharges, and the invasion of exotic species. Potrero de los Funes Village (San Luis, Argentina) is experiencing not only a population increase during summer months due to tourism but also an accelerated growth of its permanent population. In order to evaluate the potential effects of urbanization, the environmental quality of Potrero de los Funes River and Las Chacras Stream was assessed, using physical-chemical and biological indicators. Macroinvertebrates, through the application of the Biotic Index for San Luis Sierras (BISLS), anuran amphibian richness and relative abundance, and riparian vegetation were used as bioindicators. While the Simplified Index of Water Quality (SIWQ) was used to characterize the physical-chemical quality of water at each site. SIWQ and BISLS scores were significantly different between sites (F-7,F-28=9.88, p<.001 and F-7,F-28=24.18, p<.001, respectively). SIWQ was significantly correlated with BISLS (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.8, p<.001). Four anuran species were registered along Potrero River, with no significant differences in the intensity of vocalizations between sites. No species were detected in Las Chacras Stream. Average total plant species richness, exotic plants richness, and vegetation cover were higher at the most impaired system, Las Chacras Stream. The principal component analysis showed that the first two principal components (PCs) explained 76.3% of the total variance. PC1, with strong loadings of SIWQ, BISLS, and amphibian richness, was principally driven by chemical water quality and biological conditions. PC2 was mainly determined by plant richness. The chemical and biological water quality of Potrero and Las Chacras is somewhat impaired, being the upper Las Chacras Stream the most compromised area. This study provides information that will certainly be used to manage future impacts of urbanization on aquatic resources.

AB  - An improved version of the Eastern Canadian Diatom Index (IDEC: lndice Diatomees de l'Est du Canada) was developed, incorporating modifications to optimize diatom-based monitoring in Eastern Canada. The most significant improvement with this version of the IDEC is the extended coverage area including additional reference sites. This new version of the IDEC also incorporated a simplified list of diatom taxa to reduce the variability among analysts as it gains in popularity. Rare taxa (<2%) were excluded and various morphotypes were grouped. The index was created based on three sub-indices that were adapted to cover the range of natural pH and conductivity values allowing us to partial out the strong influence of natural pH and conductivity from the general pollution gradient. The index was created using 648 diatom assemblages including those from nearly 150 reference (or least-disturbed) sites. The reference sites covered a large range of natural characteristics. The diatom assemblages collected in these environments constitute "biotype class A" in each sub-index and represent a realistic goal for restoration. Associated total phosphorus and total nitrogen showed that class A generally reflects conditions that are considered oligotrophic (<0.025 mg L-1) or oligo-mesotrophic, while class D at the opposite end of the pollution gradient reflects eutrophic or hyper-eutrophic environments. There is a good correspondence between IDEC values and nutrient criteria, water quality indices based on physico-chemistry measurements, the presence of agricultural activities, and urban areas. The IDEC has a great potential to assist water quality monitoring, particularly when the objective is to assess the trophic status of a watercourse. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine if the loss of germinability and viability of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) seeds stored at different variants of temperature (4, 20, and 30 degrees C) and relative humidity (RH: 45 and 75 %) is associated with a loss of membrane integrity and changes in lipid composition. Beech seeds stored for 9 weeks gradually lost viability at a rate dependent on temperature and humidity. The harmful effect of temperature increased with growing humidity. The loss of seed viability was strongly correlated with an increase in membrane permeability and with production of lipid hydroxyperox ides (LHPO),which was regarded as an indicator of peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. The condition of membranes was assessed on the basis of their permeability and the state of lipid components: phospholipids and fatty acids. During seed storage we observed a decline in concentration of individual phospholipids and fatty acids, proportional to the loss of seeds viability. We also detected a decrease in concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and sterols, which play an important role in protection of membranes against the harmful influence of the environment. Our results show that the germinability of beech seeds declines rapidly at temperature above 0 degrees C and growing humidity. This is due mainly to the loss of membrane integrity, caused by peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids.

AB  - Freshwater mussels are considered one of the most imperiled aquatic species groups in the USA. One of the challenges in protecting and restoring mussel biodiversity effectively is a lack of understanding of their natural distributions at relevant spatial scales. Without this information, assessing the current status of individual species and overall biodiversity or evaluating restoration success is difficult. We compiled records for 45 mussel species and a range of natural environmental variables describing climate, geology, soil, land cover, and watershed topography in Illinois wadeable streams. We used reaches (segments between 2 neighboring tributaries) as the basic spatial unit of the stream network for modeling species distributions with Maxent. We applied these models statewide to all identified wadeable reaches. Stacking the predictions of individual models yielded an estimate of species richness for each reach. The estimates were compared with observed richness from 2 sets of independent sites: 17 sites sampled multiple times over the past 50 to 100 y and 18 sites intensively sampled in 2009 to 2010. The latter set was expected to represent much more impaired mussel assemblages than the former. These sets of sites lost an average of 25 and 46%, respectively, of species expected under natural conditions. Observed occupancy of individual species decreased by 27 and 35%, respectively, from expected natural values. Listed species suffered heavy occupancy loss more frequently than nonlisted species. Estimated mussel species loss was negatively correlated with 2 existing indices of biological integrity. These results, together with maps of natural distributions for individual species and for species richness, will assist with mussel biodiversity conservation and the development and use of mussel-based biological indicators in stream assessment.

AB  - Quantitative evaluation of ecological restoration effects (EREs) is essential to provide operational feedback and implement adaptive management for future riparian restoration. This manuscript aims to develop a multi-scale evaluation method of EREs based on remote sensing observations, which uses the composite index of physical structural integrity (PSI) to indicate riparian condition. The riparian EREs were quantitatively assessed by comparing the post-restoration PSI values with the ecological reference status derived from pre-restoration surveys. In addition, ecological partitioning was adopted to identify the vulnerable riparian areas and explore the influence indicators of ecological restoration. In this paper, we used the case study of the Liaohe River, the first protected area aimed to recover the riparian ecosystem in China, to evaluate the riparian EREs at three spatial scales using Landsat time series images from 1980 to 2019. Results indicated that: (1) the pre-restoration riparian ecosystem exhibited an clear degradation trend and ecological conservation was urgent; (2) riparian restoration is a continuous and heterogeneous ecological process, the project had not yet met its objectives in 2016 with a low ERE value of 49.1 (Poor), while achieved a significant success in 2019 with the ERE value of 68.8 (Very good); (3) the limited restoration partitions with a ERE value below 60 accounted for 42.8% of riparian zones, which were the fragile riparian ecosystems and mainly distributed in reach D and F; and (4) the dominant factors for riparian restoration were canopy coverage, human disturbance and natural vegetation percent.

AB  - In the context of river alteration, ecologists are asked to develop tools for the assessment of river integrity. Fish are known to be good bioindicators of the ecological condition of rivers. The Loire basin (France) is often considered as relatively little impacted compared to most other large European systems. But curiously, no study clearly addressed the question of fish assemblages patterns in this system in order to assess this status. Thus, we studied fish assemblages along the river network in the Loire basin using self-organizing maps (SOMs) and we built a fish typology. Four basic assemblages were described and indicator species were identified. These assemblages varied in terms of individual species patterns as well as in terms of flow preference guilds and species richness. A discriminant analysis carried out on environmental variables revealed that they could be mainly determined by the slope, temperature and depth. Finally, fish assemblages were arrayed along a longitudinal gradient and roughly fitted the theoretical zonation expected in European rivers with the succession of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), grayling (Thymallus thymallus), barbel (Barbus barbus) and bream (Abramis brama) zones in a downstream direction. Such patterns are still rarely observed in large European systems. However, the fish assemblage characteristic of the bream zone occurred more frequently than predicted on the basis of environmental variables. Such deviations between field data and theory suggest lotic-to-lentic shifts probably due to anthropogenic disturbances, especially in the grayling and barbel zones. In these river sectors, eurytopic and limnophilic species tend to replace rheophilic ones. Finally, the method used in this study to investigate fish patterns may be helpful to detect disturbances and may serve as a tool for the establishment of management plans.

AB  - Coastal dunes are transitional systems which offer manifold ecosystem services, including material and intangible benefits, whose relevance for human society has been little investigated to date. In order to plan a sustainable use of these threatened ecosystems, proper indicators to quantify ecological services and functions over time should be provided. Since the functionality of coastal dunes is affected by the specific contiguity among different dune habitat patches, in this paper we propose the use of landscape integrity, expressed by the number and length of boundary types among the aforementioned habitats, as an ecosystem functionality indicator. In particular, we aim at properly expressing the trend of coastal dune mosaic integrity in two Italian LTER sites over the last sixty years by applying a generalized diversity function on the number and length of boundary types. Such functions, unlike a traditional diversity index, allow a complete summarization of landscape diversity and structure. The proposed method has proved to be effective in the considered context, because it has adequately underlined the different landscape integrity trend recorded in the two sites. In particular, generalized diversity functions showed to efficiently express both rough and moderate anthropogenic transformations, which affected spatial heterogeneity and functionality of the considered coastal dune mosaic. Further applications at different scales and across different ecosystems are encouraged. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Watershed land use in suburban areas can affect stream biota through degradation of instream habitat, water quality, and riparian vegetation. By monitoring stream biotic communities in various geographic regions, we can better understand and conserve our watershed ecosystems. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between watershed land use and the integrity of benthic invertebrate communities in eight streams that were assessed over a 3-year period (2001-2003). Sites were selected from coastal Rhode Island watersheds along a residential land-use gradient (4-59%). Using the rapid bioassessment protocol, we collected biological, physicochemical, habitat, and nutrient data from wadeable stream reaches and compared metrics of structure and integrity. Principal component analyses showed significant negative correlation of indicators for stream physicochemical, habitat, and instream biodiversity with increasing residential land use (RLU) in the watershed. The physicochemical variables that were most responsive to percent RLU were conductivity, instream habitat, nitrate, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The positive correlation of DIN with percent RLU indicated an anthropogenic source of pollution affecting the streams. The biotic composition of the streams shifted from sensitive to insensitive taxa as percent RLU increased; the most responsive biological variables were percent Ephemeroptera, percent Scrapers, percent Insects, and the Hilsenhoff biotic index. These data show the importance of land management and conservation at the watershed scale to sustaining the biotic integrity of coastal stream ecosystems.

AB  - Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) of the Gulf of Ambracia are exposed to numerous growing anthropogenic impacts, rendering them more prone to cutaneous changes. The prevalence of skin conditions in this resident population was evaluated based on photo-identification. Five skin lesions previously described in other studies were considered, namely dark-fringed spots, white-fringed spots, orange patch, tattoo-like and white fin-fringe, in addition to a new particularly severe condition named as "white dots" (WD). A 37% prevalence of epidermal lesions was detected on a total of 153 dolphins. The newly identified WD was the skin condition most frequently observed (45%) in the area, showing considerable differences on its severity between individuals. From 29 dolphins affected by WD in 2012, two were severely affected throughout their 10-year photo-id records and all of them either worsened over the years, or maintained their WD condition. No cases were found in which WD resolved over time. The increasingly degraded conditions of the Gulf of Ambracia may be influencing their epidermal integrity or causing them physiological stress. The epidermal conditions here reported, in some cases very conspicuous and relatively easy to monitor over the years, might act as indicators of environmental burden. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Temporal trends in attributes of restored ecosystems have been described conceptually as restoration trajectories. Measures describing the maturity or ecological integrity of a restoration site are often assumed to follow monotonically increasing trajectories over time and to eventually reach an asymptote representative of a reference ecosystem. This assumption of simple, predictable restoration trajectories underpins federal and state policies in the United States that mandate wetland restoration as compensation for wetlands damaged during development. We evaluated the validity of this assumption by tracking changes in 11 indicators of floristic integrity, often used to determine legal compliance, in 29 mitigation wetlands. Each indicator was expressed as a percentile relative to the distribution of that indicator among >100 naturally occurring reference wetlands. Nonlinear regression was used to fit two alternative restoration trajectories to data from each site: an asymptotic (negative exponential) increase in the indicator over time and a peaked (double exponential) relationship. Depending on the particular indicator, between 48% and 76% of sites displayed trends that were at least moderately well described (R-2 > 0.5) by one of the two models. Floristic indicators based on species richness, including native richness, number of native genera, and the floristic quality index, rapidly increased to asymptotes exceeding levels in a majority of reference wetlands. In contrast, indicators based on species composition, including mean coefficient of conservatism and relative importance of perennial species, increased very slowly. Thus, some indicators of restoration progress followed increasing trajectories and achieved or surpassed levels equivalent to high-quality reference sites within five years, whereas others appeared destined to either not reach equivalency or to take much longer than mitigation wetlands are typically monitored. Finally, some indicators of restoration progress, such as relative importance of native species, often increased over the first five to 10 years and then declined, which would result in a misleading assessment of progress if based on typical time scales of monitoring. Therefore, the assumption of simple, rapid, and predictable restoration trajectories that underlies wetland mitigation policy is unrealistic.

AB  - Indicators and their composite indices have been embraced as development tools for guiding humanity toward a sustainable destination. In response, public and private organizations have generated hundreds of these metrics, making their application overwhelming to policymakers, planners, and scientists. Past reviews have revealed that a majority of common development indices have theoretical or quantitative shortcomings, supporting that there is no consensus regarding their theoretical basis, design, use, thresholds-of-effect, or validation. In response, this study was designed around four guiding research questions: (1) What are the underlying development themes within a collection of established sustainability indices, and what distinguishes winning locations from losing ones? (ii) Are the three major divisions of sustainability (economic growth, social equity, environmental integrity) equally represented by current sustainable development measuring initiatives? (iii) Could just a few common and freely available indicators capture all present dimensions of sustainable development? (iv) Would a new sustainable development mega-index research paradigm improve humanity's ability to assess progress toward sustainability? Those questions were investigated using data from 30 mostly contiguous Western Hemisphere nations and three amassing methodological objectives. First, 31 known indices were reduced into underlying dimensions (factors) of sustainable development. Next, those factors were combined (aggregated) into the first mega-index of sustainable development (MISD). Finally, 11 common development indicators were explored regarding collinearity and explanatory power of the sustainable development dimensions and MISD. Seven latent dimensions (sub-metrics) captured over 85% of the variation of the original 31 indices, with socioeconomic themes dwarfing environmental ones. The factors conveyed: (F1) socioeconomic well-being synergies; (F2) economic freedom and democracy; (F3) environmentally efficient happiness; (F4) ecosystem well-being; (F5) peace to economic vulnerability tradeoff; (F6) natural resources protection; and (F7) environmental stewardship and risk resilience. MISD is the geometric mean of the seven sub-metrics, which were directed toward sustainability, and resealed (normalized) 0 (worst case) to 100 (best case). Geographically, this study ranked Belize best overall, followed by Guyana, Panama, Uruguay, and Canada; Barbados ranked worst, preceded by Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, and Cuba. Winning countries were characterized by low population density, increased forestland, decreased urban, and larger country area. Child mortality and population growth rate remained negative predictors of socioeconomic conditions; however per-capita CO2 sacrificed ecological integrity for improved human well-being. Mega-index creation will serve as an important scientific stepping-stone for improving accuracy and simplifying valuations of sustainable development, thus others should follow.

AB  - Macrobenthic communities are useful biological indicators for monitoring the health status of marine environments. In this context, biological indices have been widely developed based on macrobenthic communities in order to distinguish the ecological status of marine environments. In this study, results from several indices such as Shannon-Weiner, AZTI Marine Biotic Index, Multimetric AZTI Marine Biotic Index, and BENTIX were compared and evaluated. The effects of environmental factors on the benthic communities were also studied. Results from these indices revealed significant differences in ecological status between sampling stations, which were probably due to the different structures of benthic communities and their state successions. The results consistently emphasized the anthropogenic effects and natural variability caused by these variations in spatial scales.

AB  - The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) seeks to achieve good environmental status, by 2020, for European seas. This study analyses the applicability of a process-driven benthic sedimentary habitat model, to be used in the implementation of the MSFD in relation to biodiversity and seafloor integrity descriptors for sedimentary habitats. Our approach maps the major environmental factors influencing soft-bottom macrobenthic community structure and the life-history traits of species. Among the 16 environmental variables considered, a combination of water depth, mean grain size, a wave-induced sediment resuspension index and annual bottom maximum temperature, are the most significant factors explaining the variability in the structure of benthic communities in the study area. These variables are classified into those representing the 'Disturbance' and 'Scope for Growth' components of the environment. It was observed that the habitat classes defined in the process-driven model reflected different structural and functional characteristics of the benthos. Moreover, benthic community structure anomalies due to human pressures could also be detected within the model produced. Thus, the final process-driven habitat map can be considered as being highly useful for seafloor integrity and biodiversity assessment, within the European MSFD as well as for conservation, environmental status assessment and managing human activities, especially within the marine spatial planning process.

AB  - Better integration of knowledge from ecological, social and economic science is necessary to advance the understanding and modelling of socio-ecological systems. To model ecosystem integrity (El) and ecosystem services (ES) at the landscape scale, assessment matrices are commonly used. These matrices assign capacities to provide different services to different land cover types. We revised such an existing matrix and examined the regional heterogeneity in El and ES provision in Europe and searched for spatial gradients in their provision to elucidate their suitability for large-scale El and ES mapping in Europe. Overall, 28 sites belonging to the Long-Term Ecological Research network in Europe participated in this study, covering a longitudinal gradient from Spain to Bulgaria and a latitudinal gradient from Italy to Sweden. As a primary outcome, an improved and consolidated El and ES matrix was achieved with 17.5% of all matrix fields updated. For the first time, this new matrix also contains measures of uncertainty for each entry. El and ES provision assessments were more variable for natural and semi-natural than for more anthropogenically dominated land cover classes. Among the main types of El and ES, cultural service provision was rated most heterogeneously in Europe, while abiotic provisioning services were more constant. Longitudinal and latitudinal El and ES gradients were mostly detected in natural and semi-natural land cover types where temperature and precipitation are major drivers. In anthropogenically determined systems in which cultural services play a dominant role, temperature and precipitation gradients were less important. Our results suggest that this matrix approach to assess El and ES provision principally works on broad spatial scales; however, local assessments for natural systems seem to be less generalizable than assessments from anthropogenically determined systems. Provisioning and regulating services are more generalizable than cultural services. Particularly in natural and semi-natural systems, spatial gradients need to be considered. We discuss uncertainties associated with this matrix-based El and ES assessment approach and suggest that future large-scale studies should include additional land cover information and ecosystem disservices and may determine ES fluxes by differentiating between ES provision and consumption.

AB  - Despite substantial conservation efforts, the loss of ecosystems continues globally, along with related declines in species and nature's contributions to people. An effective ecosystem goal, supported by clear milestones, targets and indicators, is urgently needed for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and beyond to support biodiversity conservation, the UN Sustainable Development Goals and efforts to abate climate change. Here, we describe the scientific foundations for an ecosystem goal and milestones, founded on a theory of change, and review available indicators to measure progress. An ecosystem goal should include three core components: area, integrity and risk of collapse. Targets-the actions that are necessary for the goals to be met-should address the pathways to ecosystem loss and recovery, including safeguarding remnants of threatened ecosystems, restoring their area and integrity to reduce risk of collapse and retaining intact areas. Multiple indicators are needed to capture the different dimensions of ecosystem area, integrity and risk of collapse across all ecosystem types, and should be selected for their fitness for purpose and relevance to goal components. Science-based goals, supported by well-formulated action targets and fit-for-purpose indicators, will provide the best foundation for reversing biodiversity loss and sustaining human well-being.
   Sustaining ecosystems is essential for biodiversity conservation and human well-being. This Perspective synthesizes the scientific basis for an effective goal for ecosystem conservation, and associated indicators of progress, that can be applied from global to local scales.

AB  - The riparian forest reduces the amount of light entering streams, which limits autochthonous primary production. The aim of this study was to evaluate temporal variation of autochthonous primary production in pristine and altered streams, with the goal of identifying indicators of change in environmental integrity in the southern Brazilian Amazon. We evaluated free algal biomass in the water column, the presence of periphyton, and the richness and cover of aquatic herbaceous plants in 20 streams (10 pristine and 10 altered, i.e., with riparian deforestation) during the dry period, at the beginning of the rainy period, and at the end of the rainy period. In altered streams, we recorded the presence of macroscopic periphyton and the amount of algal biomass varied between the dry and flood seasons. Variations in hydrological periods did not contribute to changes in algal biomass in pristine streams; we did not observe the presence of macroscopic periphyton these streams. In altered streams, 23 aquatic herbaceous species were identified, versus only four in the pristine streams. Results showed that riparian deforestation contributes to increased autochthonous primary production, which is also influenced by different hydrological periods, with algae and aquatic herbaceous plants responding differently to dry and rainy periods. The responses of these primary producers confirm their role as important bioindicators of change in the environmental integrity of southern Amazonian streams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A data set of 625 samples of benthic macroinvertebrates collected from the Hellenic Seas (Ionian and Aegean) was used to establish thresholds and reference standards for two of the indicators addressing the descriptors of Sea-floor Integrity under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD): species diversity and richness and the ratio of sensitive species to tolerant species. The dataset was categorised according to the baseline ecological status assessment of the respective water bodies under the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Species diversity and richness were characterised using the Shannon diversity and species richness indices, respectively, and were analysed for three pre-defined substrate types, three depth zones and three sample-size categories, and the significant categories were statistically validated. Good Environmental Status (GEnS) threshold and reference values were established for the valid combinations of categories denoted as 'ecotypes' through the use of a boxplot and an analysis of variance. The limitations and specifications for an overall GEnS assessment using the above indices are highlighted based on the WFD experience. For the ratio of sensitive species to tolerant species, the BENTIX index classification scale is proposed for GEnS assessment, and an integrated approach to the assessment of diversity and species richness is suggested. Finally, the regionality of the tested indices in relation to the two Mediterranean sub-regions, including the Hellenic area, was tested.

AB  - The southern region of Guizhou Province is a typical karst mountainous region in China. The ecological environment is fragile and biodiversity is extremely vulnerable. Based on the previous research results and the actual physical and geographical conditions and biodiversity characteristics of southern Guizhou, a biodiversity evaluation index system with 9 primary indicators and 25 secondary indicators was designed, including species number, endemic species, endangered species, important resource species, diversity of ecosystem types, protected area coverage, alien species invasion, vegetation damage, and the integrity of the vertical spectrum of the vegetation. Based on the actual physical geographic conditions and collected data, the comprehensive evaluation of the biodiversity in the southern area of Guizhou Province was carried out using six primary indicators in counties (districts, cities) scale. The evaluation results show that the areas with better biodiversity are mainly concentrated in the lower mountainous areas in the southeast, and the areas with poorer biodiversity are mainly concentrated in the west with more severe rocky desertification. Libo County of the Qiannan Prefecture has the best biodiversity while Zhenfeng County of the Qianxinan Prefecture has the worst biodiversity. On the whole, the biodiversity of the southern Guizhou Province is good.. The counties with a "mediocre" review accounted for the highest proportion, reaching 41.67%, followed by "good" and "excellent", accounting for 33.33% and 13.89% of the total counties, respectively. There were no counties with a "poor" biodiversity evaluation.

AB  - Effective tools for monitoring the status of ecological restoration projects are critical for the management of restoration programs. Such tools must integrate disparate data comprised of multiple variables that describe restoration status, including the condition of environmental stressors, landscape connectivity, ecosystem resilience, and ecological structure and function, while communicating these concepts effectively to a wide range of stakeholders. In this paper we describe the process of constructing multimetric indices (MMIs) for monitoring restoration status for restoration projects currently underway on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. During this process, an initial suite of measurements is filtered for response and sensitivity to ecosystem stressors, eliminating measurements that provide little information and reducing future monitoring efforts. The retained measurements are rescaled into comparable domain metrics and assembled into MMIs. The MMIs are presented in terms of established restoration theories, including restoration trajectory and restoration endpoint targets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbon sequestration describes long term storage of carbon dioxide into geological formations. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs can be considered as a desirable storage vessel for carbon sequestration. Well cement is one of the vulnerable leakage pathways in high pressure and corrosive environments. The integrity of the cement sheath in high pressure environment must be maintained to avoid the contamination of atmosphere and underground drinking water.
   This paper presented an analytical solution to evaluate the cement sheath integrity of wells exposed to CO2 considering the effect of cement sheath induced stress (CSIS) and formation pressure variation due to CO2 injection. The proposed model was validated through the comparison of the proposed model with Atkinson's analytical model and Carter's finite element model. The well logging records further verified the analytical model. A field case analysis indicated that the maximum injection pressure (MAIP) would be underestimated if CSIS is not considered. The proposed model can be used to evaluate the cement sheath integrity in carbon sequestration fields and other gas/water injection wells in oil production fields. It can also help to design and optimize the operation parameters of the hydraulic fracturing operations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The risk of environmental contamination by oil and gas wells depends strongly on the frequency with which they lose integrity. Wells with compromised integrity typically exhibit pressure in their outermost annulus (surface casing pressure, SfCP) due to gas accumulation. SfCP is an easily measured but poorly documented gauge of well integrity. Here, we analyze SfCP data from the Colorado Oil and. Gas Conservation Commission database to evaluate the frequency of well integrity loss in the Wattenberg Test Zone (WTZ), within the Wattenberg Field, Colorado. Deviated and horizontal wells were found to exhibit SfCP more frequently than vertical wells. We propose a physically meaningful well-specific critical SfCP criterion, which indicates the potential for a well to induce stray gas migration. We show that 270 of 3923 wells tested for SfCP in the WTZ exceeded critical SfCP. Critical SfCP is strongly controlled by the depth of the surface casing. Newer horizontal wells, drilled during the unconventional drilling boom, exhibited critical SfCP less frequently than Other wells because they were predominantly constructed with deeper surface casings. Thus, they pose a lower risk for inducing stray gas migration than legacy vertical or deviated wells with surface casings shorter than modern standards.

AB  - Organisms are subject to three types of morphological asymmetry: Directional Asymmetry, Antiasymmetry and Fluctuating Asymmetry, but only the latter ( FA) is related to the environmental stress acting upon individuals during their development. Larvae of Hydropsyche morosa from five rivers in Ontario, Canada, each exhibiting different degrees of human impact, were examined for FA. Specimens were obtained from collections in the Royal Ontario Museum dating back to 1951, and from fresh collections to 1999. Twelve morphological characters were assessed on both the left and right sides of 297 larvae, and eight of them demonstrated FA. There was a tendency to increase the levels of FA over time. Levels of nitrogen, conductivity and chloride in the river water, used as an index of pollution, were significantly and positively correlated with increasing incidence of FA in four of the characters, the remainder were independent of pollution.

AB  - The upper reaches of the Rio Champoton in southwestern Mexico are largely unknown to science. This river is sustaining anthropogenic and natural disturbances by deforestation, substitution of natural vegetation. and agricultural non-point source pollution. Furthermore, hurricanes provoke flooding of these areas, exposing the aquatic biota to pollutants. Several approaches were used to assess the effects of environmental conditions along the freshwater portion of the Rio Champoton in the native fish Astyanax aeneus and to determine the feasibility of extrapolating responses between levels of organization, and to link spatial and seasonal fish responses with water quality features. A water quality index (WQI) was employed as an indicator of environmental conditions, a set of sub-organismal biomarkers in A. aeneus (lipid peroxidation, glutathione S-transferase, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and lactate dehydrogenase) was monitored to determine the integrated biomarker response (IBR), and somatic indices (individual and population-level responses; gonadosomatic, hepatosomatic, and condition factor) were characterized. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed spatial and seasonal variations in all the approaches. The dry and the wet season (April and July) exhibited low WQI scores, but decreased hardness and conductivity values as well as increased WQI values occurred during the post-hurricane season when crop fields adjacent to the riverbed were inundated. Although the WQI suggested low levels of contamination, the biomarkers did not remain static; wide fluctuations reflected fish exposure to seasonal stressors that provoked impairments in biological responses. All biomarker values were high, mainly in the post-hurricane season (November). The IBR exhibited two peaks that may be related to stress periods (April and November), with decreasing post-stress values suggesting the existence of homeostatic processes in the fish. The somatic indices reflected some seasonal and spatial differences at the population level - the gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices peaked in the middle of July and November, respectively - but the condition factor remained constant among sites and study periods. Future studies are needed to explore the link between the fish biomarker responses and possible causal stressors (natural or anthropogenic). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring the outcome of restoration efforts is the only way to identify the status of a recovery and the most effective management strategies. In this paper, we discuss Chesapeake Bay and watershed recovery and factors influencing water quality trends. For over 30 years, the Chesapeake Bay Program Partnership's long-term tidal and watershed water quality monitoring networks have measured physical, chemical and biological parameters throughout the bay and its surrounding watershed underpinning an adaptive management process to drive ecosystem recovery. There are many natural and anthropogenic factors operating and interacting to affect the watershed and bay water quality recovery responses to management actions. Across habitats and indicators, the bay and its watershed continue to express a diverse spatial and temporal fabric of multiscale conditions, stressors and trends that show a range of health conditions and impairments, as well as evidence of progress and degradation. Recurrent independent reviews of the monitoring program have driven a culture of continued adaptation of the monitoring networks to reflect ever evolving management information needs. The adherence to bay and watershed-wide consistent monitoring protocols provides monitoring data supporting analyses and development of scientific syntheses that underpin indicator and model development, regulatory assessments, targeting of management actions, evaluation of management effectiveness, and directing of priorities and policies.

AB  - We investigated the effects of water extraction and flow regime on leaf litter breakdown in 10 Hong Kong streams experiencing varying degrees of extraction: five with severe extraction (> 85% downstream flow removed), four with moderate extraction (20-85% removed), and one without extraction (similar to 0% removed). Breakdown rates, macroinvertebrate assemblages and nutrients were compared in upstream (reference) reaches and downstream reaches with reduced flow in each stream during high-flow (wet season) and low-flow (dry season) conditions to determine whether responses to flow were influenced by Hong Kong's monsoonal climate. Litter breakdown was slower in downstream reaches during the wet season, and discharge was the main determinant of breakdown rate in both reaches across the 10 study streams. In contrast, inter-reach differences in breakdown during the dry season were small and unrelated to flow. Instead, breakdown rates among streams were influenced by the abundance of detritivorous shredders and chironomids (Chironominae), as well as phosphate concentrations, indicating the importance of biological processing of litter under low-flow conditions. Although litter breakdown rates appear to offer a promising functional indicator of flow-reduction impacts during the wet season, the pattern seen reflected the physical effects of flow rather than any underlying biological processes, and the lack of response to flow reduction during the dry season was notable.

AB  - We studied streams in a rural landscape mosaic of the upper Mara River basin (Mau Forest, Kenya), where native forest has been converted to land uses dominated by various kinds of farming, agriculture and rural human settlements. We investigated scale-dependent effects of these anthropogenic rural activities on macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical variables by separately testing for effects of reach-scale disturbance and catchment-scale land use. Physico-chemical variables like conductivity, turbidity and total suspended solids reacted equally well to reach-scale disturbance and catchment-scale land use, demonstrating the high spatial integration potential of these variables and calling for farsighted large-scale water resource management. In contrast, macroinvertebrates reacted more sensitively at the reach-scale than at the catchment-scale, suggesting a stronger influence of local habitat conditions. These results highlight the importance of local stream ecosystem management, e.g., the restoration and protection of stream banks, to protect against agriculture-driven biodiversity losses. However, we also found responses of selected taxa to catchment-scale land use, suggesting that localized management efforts may not suffice to maintain full stream ecosystem integrity and regional biodiversity. Our results also suggest that macroinvertebrates may allow a scale-specific assessment of stream ecosystem integrity and pressures by a scale-dependent bioindicatory approach. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mesic grasslands in South Africa harbour a diverse community of herbaceous perennial forb species that outnumber grass species by up to 5-6:1, provide various ecosystem services as well as forage for livestock, and are sensitive to overgrazing. However, despite their prevalence and ecological importance, the potential of forb species as grazing indicators has not been evaluated nor are they routinely included in grassland condition assessments. We aimed, therefore, to identify a subset of potential grazing indicator forb species that had a consistent response to a range of grazing intensities historically applied at sites in two mesic grasslands, Midlands Mistbelt grassland (n = 123) and KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld grassland (n = 55). Canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess forb composition changes in response to an ordinal index of grazing intensity to identify the most responsive abundant forbs in each grassland. Most (88-92%) forbs had a neutral or inconsistent response to grazing but 24 and 32 species in Mistbelt and Sandstone grassland, respectively, were sufficiently abundant and responsive to be considered potential key grazing indicators. Alternative, somewhat less reliable indicator species were also identified. Grazing-sensitive indicator forbs that declined under grazing (Decreaser species) mostly were erect with elevated growing points whereas grazing-resistant species (Increasers) were predominantly prostrate species. A weighted sum of the abundance of indicators and their grazing sensitivity weights based on the relative position of their centroids along the grazing gradient provides an index (1-100), the forb condition score (FCS), of the overall impact of grazing on the forbs at a site, with high FCS indicating minimal impact. The FCS adequately predicts overall indigenous forb species richness (square-root transformed) in both Mistbelt (r(2) = 0.657) and Sandstone grassland (r(2) = 0.795). The key grazing indicator forbs identified in our study could be used together with other assessment methods of grass condition and cover for rapid and cost-effective assessment and monitoring of the impact of grazing on the integrity of mesic grassland. Further testing and refinement of the proposed grazing indicator forbs and the FCS index is, however, required.

AB  - Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) measures have become extraordinarily influential ecological metrics in North America over the past 20 yr. Government agencies, conservation organizations, land managers, and researchers alike utilize this plant-based measure to evaluate habitat conservation value, ecological integrity, and naturalness. Its relative uniqueness, utility, and ease of use, among vegetation measures, portend the continued popularity of FQA going forward. FQA's use and influence far exceeds its study-where the literature addressing questions and criticisms regarding its methodology and ecological meaning has not kept pace with reliance upon it. Furthermore, the lack of literature review has led to disorder and confusion among its users. This review addresses these issues in three parts. First, it concisely explains the metrics and their methods, and most importantly, it synthesizes the often-misinterpreted conceptual basis behind FQA. The bulk of the review then tackles common questions from researchers and non-technical users alike regarding the measures. It does this with two lists. The first list reviews FQA's most common criticisms and summarizes evidence for and against them. The second list confronts the most common mistakes surrounding FQA, regarding both its application and misunderstanding in the literature. In each instance, straightforward guidelines and answers to uncertainties are emphasized.

AB  - The aquatic ecosystems are continuously endangered due to variety of hazardous chemicals containing different toxic agents which can be emitted from anthropogenic sources. Besides the increasing of human population, various kinds of contaminants enter into the surface water resources. The aim of the present study was to investigate the abundance and diversity of macro invertebrates in two permanent streams located in the northern part of Tehran. The biological integrity of the streams was determined by manual sampling approach at five points. The distances between the sampling points were at least 2 km. The bio indicator organisms, organic pollution, and dissolved oxygen were measured. The different types of benthic invertebrates such as riffle beetle, midge and caddish fly larvae, dragon fly, may fly and stone fly nymph, riffle beetle adult, pyralid caterpillar, leech, and pouch snail were identified. It can be concluded that, the identified benthic macro invertebrates can be served as appropriate biological indicator in the studied area. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The study evaluates the potential for bird species assemblages to serve as indicators of biological integrity of rangelands in the Great Basin in much the same way that fish and invertebrate assemblages have been used as indicators in aquatic environments. Our approach was to identify metrics of the bird community using relatively simple sampling methods that reflect the degree of rangeland degradation and are consistent over a variety of vegetation types and geographic areas. We conducted the study in three range types (i.e., potential natural plant community types) in each of two widely separated areas of the Great Basin: south-eastern Idaho (sagebrush steppe range types) and west-central Utah (salt-desert shrub range types). Sites were selected in each range type to represent three levels of grazing impact, and in Idaho included sites modified for crested wheatgrass production. Birds were sampled by point counts on 9 100-m radius plots at 250-m spacing on each of 20 sites in each area during the breeding season. In sagebrush-steppe, 964 individuals in 8 species of passerine birds were used in analyses. Five metrics were significantly related to impact class, both when analyzed within range type and when analyzed with all range types combined. Species richness, relative abundance of shrub obligate species, and relative abundance of Brewer's sparrow were generally lower for the higher impact classes; whereas the reverse was true for dominance by a single species and for relative abundance of homed larks. In contrast, total number of individuals did not differ significantly as a function of impact class. In salt-desert shrub, a total of 843 birds in 4 species were included in analyses, 98% of which were homed larks. None of the metrics identified above was significantly related to impact class. Two metrics for breeding birds in sagebrush steppe (species richness and dominance) showed little overlap between values for the extremes of impact class, and thus they have potential as indicators of biological integrity. However, the sensitivity of these metrics appears to be greatest at the high impact end of the spectrum, which suggests they may have limited utility in distinguishing between sites having light and moderate impact.

AB  - Understanding the concordance between aquatic assemblages in ecological assessments and their responses to human-induced disturbances are fundamental steps toward achieving sustainable stream and catchment management. Using diatom, macroinvertebrate, and environmental data collected from northwest Chinese arid-land streams, we tested the concordance between the two assemblages in (1) the assessment results using multimetric indices (MMIs), (2) the stressors affecting the MMIs and beta-diversity, and (3) the response trajectories of MMI and beta-diversity to disturbances. Random Forest analyses revealed that diatom and macroinvertebrate metrics responded most sensitively to climatic and geomorphic variables, respectively. Diatom MMI scores had greater precision and responsiveness than macroinvertebrate MMI scores. Diatom MMI scores were negatively related to gradients in observed-expected conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, and vegetated riparian zone width. Macroinvertebrate MMI scores responded strongly to observed-expected mean substrate composition, conductivity, and phosphate. Diatom beta-diversity decreased, as nitrate, channel alternation, and phosphate increased beyond expected natural background levels. Macroinvertebrate beta-diversity was the lowest when both nitrite and % cobble neared their natural background expectations. Our results indicate that protecting aquatic systems from anthropogenic pressures depends not only on revealing causes of impairment, but also on anticipating and understanding the responses to various stressors of multiple stream biotic assemblages.

AB  - 'Ecosystem health' is a relatively new concept for environmental science and management. Although at least two international journals use the term in their titles, there have been few applications of it for estuaries and soft-sediment habitats around the world. In this paper I: (i) introduce the ideas behind ecosystem health, and assess their relation with other usage such as 'integrity' or 'quality'; (ii) sketch the sorts of multidisciplinary studies that could contribute to an assessment of health of an estuary and how these must be approached in developing useful indicators; and (iii) make a case for including measurements of the rates of ecological processes in such an assessment. These rate measurements, termed 'ecoassays', focus on important processes such as decomposition, recruitment, predator-prey interactions, and the like. A case study is introduced wherein these processes were assessed in mangrove stands of estuaries around Sydney, New South Wales, by explicitly comparing the rates of herbivory and decomposition of mangrove leaves, attack of fallen wood by shipworms, and colonization of pneumatophores by algae, as well as with more traditional estimates of 'standing stocks'. Not surprisingly, the different measures retrieved various patterns and the challenge now is to integrate these into a scheme that indicates something of value. The potential utility of such measures is discussed in relation to the various scientific and managerial requirements of environmental monitoring.

AB  - Hydromorphology is a key component for the ecological integrity of a stream. Thus, methods have to be available which allow to reliably evaluating the hydromorphological condition of a stream. The present paper compares two different approaches for describing hydromorphological quality. While the Morphological Quality Index (MQI) is based on a multimetric assessment of 28 indicators characterizing geomorphological functionality, artificiality and channel adjustments, the Hydromorphological Index of Diversity (HMID) uses statistical parameters of just two hydraulic metrics (flow velocity and flow depths) to characterize habitat quality. A correlation analysis of the indexes by means of a dataset of 39 samples shows a high correlation between MQI and HMID. Therefore, both indices can be independently used to describe hydromorphological quality of a stream. The MQI is a straightforward and efficient tool for evaluating the present condition of an entire watershed, by subdividing a stream in homogenous reaches and calculating the MQI of each reach. Contrarily, using hydrodynamic 2D modelling the HMID might be used not only for assessment of a present condition, but also as a predicting tool to compare quantitatively project variants and to evaluate their potential to improve hydromorphological quality as well as their possibility to close the gap with a reference condition.

AB  - Our study develops and demonstrates an objective method for selecting reference sites for the assessment of ecological condition in freshwater ecosystems. The method uses widely available GIS data to group potential sites based on their natural environments. It then establishes the degree and types of human activities each site is exposed to prior to scoring the sites in each group by the relative amount of human activity present. Finally, the sites in each group with the least amount of human activity are categorized as reference sites, with the boundary between reference and test sites defined to maximize the distinctiveness of the two categories with respect to human activity. Application of this technique for the purpose of identifying headwater reference basins in rural areas of southwestern Ontario resulted in the classification of basins into six natural groups based on the dominant texture of the surface geology. Development of a human activity gradient indicated that basins varied according to the amount of exposure to agricultural activities with most basins having at least moderate exposure. Establishment of the reference test boundary indicated that the selected reference basins exhibited substantively lower extents of agricultural activity than test sites for most groups. Because this method uses only widely available GIS data, it enables rapid and cost-effective identification of candidate reference sites, even for large, remote, and understudied regions.

AB  - We assessed the relative performance of diatoms and macroinvertebrates to measure municipal and industrial impacts on the ecological integrity of the three major rivers flowing through Addis Ababa. Both community metric and multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze the environmental variables and species data along the pollution gradient. This study in the Addis Ababa urban area revealed that three biologically highly stressed rivers are being impacted primarily by physical habitat degradation and both point and nonpoint pollution. The macroinvertebrate composition was liable to severe physical habitat and chemical water quality degradation. Consequently, macroinvertebrates were less diverse and not found at all at the most polluted sites with very low dissolved oxygen levels. Based on community metrics and multivariate analysis results, diatoms more reliably indicated a gradient of pollution than macroinvertebrates. However, both organism groups equally discriminated the two relatively unimpacted upstream sites from all other impacted sites. As diatoms are immobile and ubiquitous (i.e., at least a few can be found under almost any condition), they are good indicators of pollution levels among heavily impacted sites where macroinvertebrates are completely absent or less diverse. Therefore, diatoms are the powerful bioindicators; for monitoring urban-impacted and seriously stressed rivers and to examine pollution gradients and impacts of specific pollution sources.

AB  - There is widespread concern that the condition of rangelands in the Gobi Desert is declining. Opinions differ about how to translate these concerns into a defensible assessment of condition. Finding common ground is essential because condition measurements influence land-use decisions on large scales.
   We created 'condition metrics' for three Gobi Desert ecosystems. We do not use the word 'condition' to mean simply 'the measurable conditions' (attributes, observable state) of a site. Rather, we use it to describe the evaluated or judged 'condition' (health, desirability, goodness). The metrics explicitly represent the consensus view of a large (n = 92) and diverse stakeholder group, including nomadic pastoralists, botanists, wildlife ecologists and policymakers. The metrics were created by training models (regression trees) to predict stakeholder evaluation scores from site variables. These models can be used as metrics to produce a score for any site, on a scale of 0-100.
   We demonstrate using field tests that the metrics are practical to implement, sensitive to changes caused by management intervention, and produce scores which approximate the consensus view among stakeholders. There is a high level of redundancy among site variables, suggesting the metrics could be simplified for remote-sensing applications, where only some attributes are detectable.
   We conclude that the metrics are useful for evaluating rangeland condition in the Gobi Desert, and that the metrics represent the consensus opinion of a range of stakeholders. Our methods are applicable to ecosystem evaluation worldwide.

AB  - Management and conservation of aquatic systems require the ability to assess biological conditions and identify changes in biodiversity. Predictive models for fish assemblages were constructed to assess biological condition and changes in biodiversity for streams sampled in the eastern United States as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Assessment Program. Separate predictive models were developed for northern and southern regions. Reference sites were designated using land cover and local professional judgment. Taxonomic completeness was quantified based on the ratio of the number of observed native fish species expected to occur to the number of expected native fish species. Models for both regions accurately predicted fish species composition at reference sites with relatively high precision and low bias. In general, species that occurred less frequently than expected (decreasers) tended to prefer riffle areas and larger substrates, such as gravel and cobble, whereas increaser species (occurring more frequently than expected) tended to prefer pools, backwater areas, and vegetated and sand substrates. In the north, the percentage of species identified as increasers and the percentage identified as decreasers were equal, whereas in the south nearly two-thirds of the species examined were identified as decreasers. Predictive models of fish species can provide a standardized indicator for consistent assessments of biological condition at varying spatial scales and critical information for an improved understanding of fish species that are potentially at risk of loss with changing water quality conditions.

AB  - Lessonia nigrescens complex holdfasts habitats are home to a wide diversity of invertebrates. The holdfasts associated fauna is sensitive to the kelp fishery in northern Chile because one of the management recommendation is to harvest the whole plant. Considering the above, and the ecological role play by brown algae as foundation species, this study proposes the use of fauna inhabiting the holdfasts as an ecological indicator to monitor the integrity of exploited kelp beds. To accomplish this objective, the morphology of plants and holdfasts was evaluated together with the composition, abundance and community structure associated in three types of resource conservation strategies based on fishery management spatially explicit: open access areas and management areas (to harvest), and marine protected areas (with no harvest), in Atacama and Coquimbo (26-32 degrees S). The results show that high harvest pressure on exploited kelp beds transforms the plant morphology and holdfast, altering the colonization process and species aggregation predicted for these biogenic habitats modifying the expected biodiversity. Thus, associated fauna in open access areas has lower species richness, abundance and biodiversity of organisms than their counterparts in management areas or marine protected areas. Moreover, the structure of the holdfast associated communities, are more variables in open access areas. The results suggest that holdfasts are representative micro-ecosystems of the intertidal environment, and can be used as sampling replicable and comparable units to monitor exploited kelp beds integrity in fisheries open access areas. This ecological indicator is easy to evaluate and disseminate among users of the kelp productive chain.

AB  - Implementation of policies about the conservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems' biodiversity and ecological integrity requires rapid assessment methods. The landscapes of the Carpathian Mountains, spanning an unusually steep gradient of land-use intensity from a European perspective, offer great opportunities for evaluating such methods. Focusing on the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), we evaluated three approaches for assessing macroinvertebrate species richness in second and third order streams: (1) the use of data at higher taxonomic levels, (2) the use of species-level data, and (3) the use of abundance data. The number of families was a reliable indicator of species richness within EPT. Species richness of Trichoptera was strongly correlated to species richness in Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, and thus in the EPT group as a whole, whereas species richness in Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera did not perform as well. We found little evidence for the usefulness of abundance data as a surrogate for species richness within orders, except in Plecoptera. Taxa richness in EPT was generally positively related to forest cover in the catchments and negatively related to the proportion of agricultural land. EPT taxa richness could be used to distinguish between High/Good quality classes and those of lower ecological quality according to the EU Water Framework Directive. Our results suggest that assessments focusing on the family level provide a cost-efficient alternative to species-level assessments in second and third order streams, and point at Trichoptera as a potential indicator group.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the long-term changes in water chemistry, physical habitat, and fish fauna/composition before and after construction of the Sejong Weir in Geum River, South Korea, during 2007-2014, and to evaluate the integrated ecological health based on chemical water quality, physical habitat, and biotic integrity using a star plot integration approach. As an indicator of water quality, the mean total phosphorus (TP) in the surface water decreased 2.6-fold after weir construction, indicative of P sedimentation from the water column due to structural changes from a lotic to a lentic system. The chlorophyll-a concentration decreased in response to P levels. Considering total nitrogen (TN), more than 91.7% of the total observations after weir construction (n = 96) had a TN:TP ratio >17, indicating potential P limitations on algal growth. The log-transformed TN:TP ratio had a weak positive correlation (p<0.005, R-2 = 0.085, n = 96) with TN and a strong negative correlation (p<0.001, R-2 = 0.575, n = 96) with TP. This indicated that the N:P ratio was regulated mainly by variations in P rather than N. After weir construction, the population of the lotic-type fish Zacco platypus decreased 13-fold, and the population of the lentic-type fish Pseudorasbora parva increased 3-fold. Overall, the integrated ecological health assessments revealed large degradations of >3-fold in biotic health, 2-fold in physical habitat health, and >5-fold in chemical health after weir construction.

AB  - An intensive review of existing Water Law has just been conducted by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. The review was motivated by the need for preparation for new legislation to support water resource management with a goal of "some for all, forever." The development of a water resource protection policy was begun in that review. This paper describes the major aspects of the policy at one point in a process of rapid development. Initial proposals are to use the concept of ecological integrity as an indicator of sustainable use of the resource. While management's goal is to ensure all water users will benefit from access to the water resource, ecological integrity provides a good indication of sustainability in the use of the resource. More discussion in this paper is, therefore, centred on ecological integrity than on individual water users under the assumption that the resource will only be able to provide for long term water uses if ecological integrity is assured. A water Reserve has been defined that is intended to protect water resources, so basic human needs can be met and ecological functions and processes can be sustained. Components of ecological integrity, that is, the chemical and physical characteristics of water, the quantity and assurance of water, the habitat (instream and riparian); and the structure and function of the associated biotic communities would be assessed through the use of a resource classification system. The approach integrates resource-directed measures for protection (such as resource quality objectives) with source-directed measures (such as effluent standards).

AB  - Ecosystem integrity has become a focus of watershed management. Recently much attention has been paid to the analysis of eco-hydrological data for developing a better understanding of how flow regimes influence the structures and functions of riverine ecosystems. This study explores ecosystem integrity in Taiwan rivers through characterizing the relationship between flow regimes (long-term continuous hydrological observational datasets) and fish communities (non-continuous ecological monitoring datasets) using soft computing techniques (self-organizing feature map (SOM) and clustering methods). The analysis is driven by the Taiwan Eco-hydrologic Indicator System (TEIS) statistics and biodiversity measures, in which data sets consist of 74 long-term monitoring records of flow and fisheries at 38 locations in 12 rivers in Taiwan. Results indicate that: (1) flow regimes of the 12 rivers can be related to watershed locations, namely upstream, midstream and downstream regions; (2) fish diversity is significantly higher in midstream regions than in up- and downstream regions; and (3) a consistent relationship between flow regime and fish community can be obtained when using presence-abundance data. Flow regime characteristics are consistent with respect to the hydro-geographical and ecological characteristics of streams, especially for midstream reaches, which provides further evidence of the importance of natural flow regimes in sustaining ecological integrity. These analysis results offer valuable insights into management options that support decision-makers in evaluation and classification of ecological status and provide further analyzed evidence to address ecological flow regime issues in water resources management.

AB  - Community-based responses of fish fauna to anthropogenic pressures have been extensively used to assess the ecological quality of estuarine ecosystems. Several methodologies have been developed recently combining metrics reflecting community structure and function. A fish community facing significant environmental disturbances will be characterized by a simplified structure, with lower diversity and complexity. However, estuaries are naturally dynamic ecosystems exposed to numerous human pressures, making it difficult to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic-induced changes to the biological community. In the present work, the variability of several fish metrics was assessed in relation to different pressures in estuarine sites. The response of a multimetric index (Estuarine Fish Assessment Index) was also analysed. Overall, fish metrics and the multimetric index signalled anthropogenic stress, particularly environmental chemical pollution. The fish assemblage associated with this type of pressure was characterized by lower species diversity, lower number of functional guilds, lower abundance of marine migrants and of piscivorous individuals, and higher abundance of estuarine resident species. A decreased ecological quality status, based on the EFAI, was also determined for sites associated with this pressure group. Ultimately, the definition of each pressure groups favoured a stressor-specific analysis, evidencing pressure patterns and accounting for multiple factors in a highly dynamic environment.

AB  - Bioassessment of surface waters is one of the most important approaches to predict the deterioration of ecosystems and achieve environmental sustainability according to the application of the European Water Framework Directive. The present review emphasizes the importance of the bioassessment of freshwater quality especially running waters based on diatom metrics. Nutrient enrichment and hydromorphological alternation driven by human activities are the main factors for the ecological compromise of freshwater ecosystems. Currently, the bioassessment of the ecological condition of inland water bodies is adopted worldwide. Bioassessment is complementary to physicochemical and hydromorphological data for evaluating the ecological conditions of rivers; however, measuring all the physical and chemical changes is expensive and impractical. Therefore, monitoring biota helps to determine the changes occurring in ecosystems. Thus, diatoms are used as bioindicators to assess environmental conditions of the ecosystems, but their use requires great taxonomic knowledge, otherwise, the results will be biased. Many diatom indices have been developed based on the trophic weight and indicator values of diatoms in different ecoregions in the last decades. This review highlights the importance and advantages of using diatom metrics in the bioassessment of the ecological status of surface waters in the different ecoregions, especially running water. To analyze the complex response of diatom communities to environmental gradients and assess the quality of the ecosystem, multivariate statistical approaches are needed.
   The challenge here is how to define criteria for classes of water bodies in a biologically meaningful way. For this reason, biological condition gradient is suggested as an appropriate and effective approach to develop trophic criteria based on the relationships between nutrient concentrations and biological indicators of ecological conditions.
