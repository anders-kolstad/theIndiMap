AB  - Carbon allocation to different tissues and organs of Late Pennsylvanian-aged coal-swamp plants was determined for the first time through study of coal balls from the Calhoun coal of central Illinois. Coal balls are concretions that preserve the original peat fabric of the coal seam; they occur within the coal matrix and generally are permineralized with calcium carbonate. Coalified plant cell walls are preserved within the mineral matrix of the coal ball, entombed within the calcium carbonate. Relative carbon allocation was determined by separation of the mineral matrix and organic carbon. Carbon content was determined for replicates of tissues or organs of Psaronius tree ferns, Medullosa pteridosperms, the lycopsid Sigillaria approximata, the small fern Botryopteris forensis, and ''whole peat''. Unit volume results for tissues and organs were normalized for trunk sections 45 cm in diameter and 1 m long. Psaronius tree ferns were significantly ''cheaper'' than all other plants due to the large mantle of aerenchymatous roots that made up the bulk of the trunk. Medullosans and small ferns were most ''expensive'', with the arborescent lycopsid in between. Relative expense of construction closely parallels the inferred ecological role of each plant within ancient coal swamps, deduced from distributional patterns and indicators of habitat conditions. Tree ferns and lycopsids are colonists, medullosans are site occupying forms.

AB  - Background: There are few data on the natural history and prognosis of persons with chronic fatigue (CF) or CF syndrome (CFS). Therefore, we compared functional outcomes in patients with each condition and tested the validity of various prognostic indicators.
   Methods: Four hundred forty-five (89%) of 498 consecutive referral patients were surveyed an average of 1.5; years after an initial evaluation. Data from the initial evaluation were used to predict outcomes.
   Results: Sixty-four percent of all patients reported improvement, but only 2% reported complete resolution of symptoms. Patients initially diagnosed as having CFS reported greater symptom severity and lower level of functioning at follow-up than did patients with CF. Major depression predicted unemployment in the CF group. Older age, longer duration of illness, and a lifetime history of dysthymia predicted less improvement in the CF group. Current dysthymia predicted less improvement for the CFS group.
   Conclusions: The case definition of CFS according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies chronically fatigued patients with poorer prognosis. In a tertiary care setting, recovery from CF or CFS is rare, but improvement is common. Prognostic indicators vary for the two groups, but the coexistence of dysthymia suggests poorer outcomes generally.

AB  - Dogs housed in shelters may experience poor welfare. To ensure these dogs a good quality of life, welfare assessment tools should be sensitive not only to the animals' physical health but also to their mental state, including the assessment of positive and negative emotions. In this study, we focused on the assessment of shelter dogs' emotional expression using a Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA) approach. Previous work successfully applied QBA to assess the emotional state of working and rescue dogs, and the observations were carried out on individual dogs in standardised settings with little or no stimulation. Results from such experiments might not be fully representative of the expressive demeanour that a dog could show in shelter conditions, where animals are exposed to a number of social and environmental stimuli. Thus, our aim was to apply QBA to a wider variety of shelter environments and social contexts than has been done so far, giving the animals the opportunity to express a wider repertoire of emotions and allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of dogs' affective state. A set of descriptive terms was generated using Free-Choice-Profiling methodology by a group of 13 observers. QBA was made by scoring 16 video clips of shelter dogs in very different contexts (e.g. single/pair/group housing, presence/absence of human activity). Generalised Procrustes Analysis showed a high consensus between observers' scoring patterns (75.7%; p < 0.001), and generated three main consensus dimensions explaining overall 66.6% of the variation between clips. The terms generated by the observers describing these consensus dimensions were semantically consistent, and characterised dogs as ranging: 1) from "playful/sociable/curious" to "bored/uncomfortable/apathetic", 2) from "relaxed/tranquil" to "nervous/alert/fearful" and 3) from "stressed/anxious" to "wary/timorous/hesitant". Overall, these broad dimensions are similar to those described in previous QBA studies on dogs. However, we detected differences in the type or frequency of the terms used, especially concerning three semantic spheres (i.e. "sociability", "fearfulness" and "boredom"). It appears that, compared to what has been reported previously, by presenting more complex contexts and thus giving the animals the opportunity to express different behaviours, we generated a richer list of terms representing a wider repertoire of emotions. Our results support the notion that QBA can be immediately sensitive to an animal's circumstances, integrating the ways in which, animals experience the conditions in which they live into meaningful emotional indicators. This also highlights the importance of developing QBA tools that are species- and context-specific, especially for applied purposes.

AB  - Improvements in excavation methods, dating, analytical techniques and statistical applications have all led to a substantial increase in recoverable environmental evidence from micromammals. Because these animals are so small the information they provide is on a smaller geographical scale than that afforded by most other lines of evidence. However, with increasing amounts of data and greater interpretational precision in all spheres, the chances are improving of being able to mesh information from different scales. Blombos, Pinnacle Point and Klasies River on the southern coast of South Africa have clearly demonstrated that micromammalian data can contribute to multidisciplinary interpretations of past conditions, in this case during MIS 5 and 6. Little attention has been paid to the generally small samples from Iron Age sites but the presence of the House rat Rattus rattus may provide important information about human movements and may also contribute to our understanding of the Anthropocene once this has been formally defined. Micromammals have not yet been used as chronostratigraphic indicators in southern Africa but it may be possible to develop biochronologies using them and to incorporate this material into African Land Mammal Ages.

AB  - We begin this article by delineating the explanatory gaps left by prevailing gene-focused approaches in our understanding of phenotype determination, inheritance, and the origin of novel traits. We aim not to diminish the value of these approaches but to highlight where their implementation, despite best efforts, has encountered persistent limitations. We then discuss how each of these explanatory gaps can be addressed by expanding research foci to take into account biological agency-the capacity of living systems at various levels to participate in their own development, maintenance, and function by regulating their structures and activities in response to conditions they encounter. Here we aim to define formally what agency and agents are and-just as importantly-what they are not, emphasizing that agency is an empirical property connoting neither intention nor consciousness. Lastly, we discuss how incorporating agency helps to bridge explanatory gaps left by conventional approaches, highlight scientific fields in which implicit agency approaches are already proving valuable, and assess the opportunities and challenges of more systematically incorporating biological agency into research programs.

AB  - This paper reviews adverse effects of heat stress on haematology and small intestinal changes as well as the beneficial effects of antioxidant agents, and probable mechanisms by which the agents ameliorate heat stress. High ambient temperature and high relative humidity cause heat stress, which negatively impacts on production, reproduction, immunity and health of broiler chickens. The cardiovascular system, particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, is an indicator of physiological responses to stressors by broiler chickens. Heat stress decreases small intestinal blood flow, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration and alters the ratio of leucocyte types. Impaired blood flow causes injury to small intestinal morphology, including villi and crypts; impairs digestion, decreases rate of nutrient absorption and bird development, resulting in reduced body weight in broiler chickens. Antioxidant supplementation, involving vitamins C and E, fisetin, betaine, probiotic, taurine and melatonin, boosts the capacity of biological antioxidant barrier to combat reactive oxygen species, which are generated in excess during heat stress. In conclusion, antioxidants, by ameliorating adverse effects of heat stress on haematological and small intestinal changes, are promising prophylactic agents in enhancing productivity of broiler chickens under heat-stress conditions.

AB  - Many Caribbean nations lack information on the ecology and biology of marine species, which are essential for food security and livelihoods in the region. This study aimed to advance the knowledge of two commercially important fish species, lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris) and white grunt (Haemulon plumierii), using cost-efficient techniques. Specifically, geometric morphometrics was used to assess the presence of ecomorphological groups (characterized by body shape variation associated with local environmental variables) in the Honduran Caribbean continental platform. Photographs of 104 lane snapper and 99 white grunt adult individuals were taken and digitalized with 12 landmarks. Subsequently body shape patterns were related to environmental variables using Distance-based linear models and Partial Least Squares. Results enabled the identification of ecomorphological groups or fish stocks in the study region associated with the environmental conditions of each site. Distance to river mouth and Chlorophyll a, both indicators of land-based stressors, appeared as the primary driving force of body shape differentiation in the species. These results are key for the development of informed reef fisheries management policies in the Caribbean region.

AB  - Duckweed is one kind of promising bioenergy plant with prominent advantages such as fast growth rate and high starch content. However, almost all previous studies focused on the natural duckweed germplasms. In this study, heavy-ion irradiation was used to establish a mutant library ofLemna aequinoctialis6002, and one mutant named submarine-1 (sub-1) was screened, which could accumulate more starch but with smaller granules. Unexpectedly, under proper external growth conditions such as poor nutritional status and insufficient growth space,sub-1mutant would sink underwater due to formation of dense tissue structure and large amount of fine starch particles with the extension of cultivation time. The starch content in the sinkingsub-1increased to over 45% (dry weight) and was 12% higher than the floatingsub-1, highlighting that submergence can be considered as a spontaneous and efficient indicator for screening of high-starch duckweed. Additionally, the saccharification efficiency of starch and ethanol yield had increased insub-1mutant compared to the wild type. Based on the unique characteristics ofsub-1mutant, a cultivation model of submerged duckweed in a simulated aquaculture pond was designed to get more starch-rich biomass, enabling effective production of renewable bioenergy.

AB  - Overall, urbanization in Brazil causes many environmental and social problems, among which we highlight the public health impacts. This study examined the use of geoprocessing tools that can help understand the relationship between the quality of water in rivers and the incidence of acute diarrheal diseases. In a Brazilian municipality, we carried out environmental monitoring in points of a river, then sought information as to waterborne diseases, and used the following geoprocessing tools: spatial distribution analysis with distance nearest tool and kernel density estimation; and cluster analysis with the average nearest neighbour and the K Ripley function. Among the results are the following: the point with the worst water quality groups most of the cases of diarrheal diseases, corroborating the classical association that links this result to the worst living conditions; among the tools used, the kernel density estimation enabled spatial visualization of clustering of cases of diarrhea; and Ripley's K function statistically demonstrated this agglomeration. The information derived from the environmental monitoring of rivers contributes to identify the possible causes of diarrheal diseases. The spatial analyses conducted can be replicated in other municipalities, in order to identify risk areas to diarrheal diseases and to allow preventive actions.

AB  - Railway track support conditions affect ground-borne vibration generation and propagation. Therefore this paper presents a combined experimental and numerical study into high speed rail vibrations for tracks on three types of support: a cutting, an embankment and an at grade section. Firstly, an experimental campaign is undertaken where vibrations and in-situ soil properties are measured at three Belgian rail sites. A finite element model is then developed to recreate the complex ground topology at each site. A validation is performed and it is found that although the at-grade and embankment cases show a correlation with the experimental results, the cutting case is more challenging to replicate. Despite this, each site is then analysed to determine the effect of earthworks profile on ground vibrations, with both the near and far fields being investigated. It is found that different earthwork profiles generate strongly differing ground-borne vibration characteristics, with the embankment profile generating lower vibration levels in comparison to the cutting and at-grade cases. Therefore it is concluded that it is important to consider earthwork profiles when undertaking vibration assessments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban plannings and design processes, through land management, are important factors that significantly influence the distribution of urban green lands (UGLs), and thus, the provision of ecosystem services (ESs), thereby providing opportunities for managing climate adaptation processes at the local level. However, planning for UGLs is often secondary to other planning categories, and they often remain underutilized. Through an analysis of Master Plans of major urban centres in Serbia and Bulgaria, this paper discusses the conceptualization of UGLs and the integration of ESs in planning and design processes. Based on findings obtained through an Analytical Hierarchy Process, this paper develops a conceptual framework for linking ESs with different UGL types in the course of urban planning, in order to achieve a better application of UGLs in strategies for the amelioration of micro-climatic conditions in urban areas. This paper proposes framework for an ecosystem sensitive conceptualization of UGLs in planning and design process, where UGL typology should replace functional categories, and spatial indicators are defined in relation to UGL types. Such an approach can improve the understanding and ES-sensitive application of UGLs in planning processes and local adaptation strategies.

AB  - A new screening method has been explored for direct analysis of tobacco smoke biomarkers in biological matrices (i.e., saliva and urine). Single run analysis using Atmospheric pressure Solid Analysis Probe (ASAP) and high resolution mass spectrometry with quadrupole and time of flight detector has been applied directly to some biological samples (i.e., urine and saliva), providing a fast, efficient and sensitive method of identification. The method has been applied to saliva and urine samples from heavy tobacco smokers for exposure studies. Nicotine itself, nicotine metabolites (i.e., cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, nicotine-N-glucuronide) and other related tobacco smoke toxic compounds (i.e., NNK 4-[methyl(nitroso)amino]-1-(3-pyridiny1)-1-butanone, anatabine) were found in the analyzed samples. The identification of compounds was confirmed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography with MS-triple quadrupole detector after sample treatment. Different temporal trends and biomarkers behavior have been found in time series related samples. Both methods are compared for screening of these biological matrices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increases in noise-generating human activities since the Industrial Revolution have changed the acoustic landscape of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Anthropogenic noise is now recognized as a major pollutant of international concern, and recent studies have demonstrated impacts on, for instance, hearing thresholds, communication, movement and foraging in a range of species. However, consequences for survival and reproductive success are difficult to ascertain. Using a series of laboratory-based experiments and an open-water test with the same methodology, we show that acoustic disturbance can compromise antipredator behaviour - which directly affects survival likelihood - and explore potential underlying mechanisms. Juvenile European eels (Anguilla anguilla) exposed to additional noise (playback of recordings of ships passing through harbours), rather than control conditions (playback of recordings from the same harbours without ships), performed less well in two simulated predation paradigms. Eels were 50% less likely and 25% slower to startle to an ambush predator' and were caught more than twice as quickly by a pursuit predator'. Furthermore, eels experiencing additional noise had diminished spatial performance and elevated ventilation and metabolic rates (indicators of stress) compared with control individuals. Our results suggest that acoustic disturbance could have important physiological and behavioural impacts on animals, compromising life-or-death responses.

AB  - In this paper, analytical procedures are proposed for determination of inorganic constituents in honey samples from different regions of Brazil. Inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry detection (ICP-MS) was used to determine the analytes, using two different sample preparation methods: acid mineralization in block digester and microwave-assisted acid digestion. The methods were optimized in order to minimize the final acidity and the residual carbon content after the sample preparation. It was observed that mineralization using microwave radiation with 2 mol L-1 HNO3 was the most suitable method for determination of minerals and trace elements by ICP-MS. Besides, Se, Mg, Ca, Al, P, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ba, and Pb were determined in 60 honey samples by ICP-MS. The appropriate instrumental conditions were also evaluated for this determination, as the need of the use of collision-reaction interface and internal standards. The accuracies were evaluated using two certified reference materials, and the recoveries ranged from 82 to 115 %. The results showed no evidence of contamination in the honey samples analyzed.

AB  - This article provides practical guidance on the use of passive sampling methods (PSMs) that target the freely dissolved concentration (C-free) for improved exposure assessment of hydrophobic organic chemicals in sediments. Primary considerations for selecting a PSM for a specific application include clear delineation of measurement goals for C-free, whether laboratory-based "ex situ" and/or field-based "in situ" application is desired, and ultimately which PSM is best-suited to fulfill the measurement objectives. Guidelines for proper calibration and validation of PSMs, including use of provisional values for polymer-water partition coefficients, determination of equilibrium status, and confirmation of nondepletive measurement conditions are defined. A hypothetical example is described to illustrate how the measurement of C-free afforded by PSMs reduces uncertainty in assessing narcotic toxicity for sediments contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The article concludes with a discussion of future research that will improve the quality and robustness of C-free measurements using PSMs, providing a sound scientific basis to support risk assessment and contaminated sediment management decisions.

AB  - Coccolithophores have influenced the global climate for over 200 million years(1). These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of total carbon fixation in some systems(2). They form blooms that can occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and are distinguished by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate exoskeletons (coccoliths), rendering them visible from space(3). Although coccolithophores export carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the sea floor, they also release CO2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO2 production or uptake, sequestration and export to the deep ocean(4). Here we report the first haptophyte reference genome, from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and sequences from 13 additional isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core genes plus genes distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an atypical complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a single species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoires. Genome variability within this species complex seems to underpin its capacity both to thrive in habitats ranging from the equator to the subarctic and to form large-scale episodic blooms under a wide variety of environmental conditions.

AB  - Cultivation-based studies have demonstrated that yellow-band disease (YBD), a lesion-producing ailment affecting diverse species of coral, is caused by a consortium of Vibrio spp. This study takes the first cultivation-independent approach to examine the whole bacterial community associated with YBD-like lesioned corals. Two species of Fungiidae corals, Ctenactis crassa and Herpolitha limax, displaying YBD-like lesions were examined across diverse reefs throughout the Red Sea. Using a pyrosequencing approach targeting the V1-V3 regions of the SSU rRNA gene, no major differences in bacterial community composition or diversity were identified between healthy and lesioned corals of either species. Indicator species analysis did not find Vibrio significantly associated with the lesioned corals. However, operational taxonomic units belonging to the Ruegeria genus of Alphaproteobacteria and NS9 marine group of Flavobacteria were significantly associated with the lesioned corals. The most striking trend of this dataset was that reef location was found to be the most significant influence on the coral-bacterial community. It is possible that more pronounced lesion-specific bacterial signatures might have been concealed by the strong influence of environmental conditions on coral-bacteria. Overall, this study demonstrates inconsistencies between cultivation-independent and cultivation-based studies regarding the role of specific bacteria in coral diseases.

AB  - The objective of this work was to determine a glyphosate formulation effects on the root length reduction (average effective concentration: EC50) using germination bioassays with lettuce and wheat seeds. For lettuce nine decreasing doses/treatments between 1,215 and 0.01215 g a.i.ha(-1)(formulated as: N phosphonometyl glycine ammonium salt 40.5 [g e.a. glyphosate 36.9% ply]) and for wheat five decreasing doses (12.15 and 1.215 g a.i.ha(-1)) and their respective negative controls (distilled water) were tested. Bioassays were carried out in Petri boxes with wet filter paper with 3ml of corresponding solution. Twenty seeds were sowed per box, treatments being distributed in blocks at random with 4 repetitions in germination chamber under alternating light and dark condition at 20 degrees C. All seed average root length and repetition were estimated with a digital caliper. The average germination percentage of treatments and the germination index was also determined. EC50 or doses reducing 50% their radical growth for lettuce and wheat were 6.682 and 9.416 g a.i.ha(-1). Plant materials tested resulted sensitive to the different glyphosate doses and they can be used as biological indicators of the specific toxicity.

AB  - The operation of an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was assessed by determining the removal efficiency of treatment processes. For that purpose, different physicochemical and microbiological parameters, including total, active and culturable bacteria, were measured along a year. Values of both physicochemical and microbiological parameters were significantly reduced by biological treatment but no relation between these groups of parameters was obtained. Besides, results suggest that microbiological parameters were more sensitive than physicochemical ones to changes in WWTP conditions (i.e. influent quality). Additionally, high percentages of noncultured (>88%) and noncultured remaining active (until 50%) cells were detected before and after treatment. Therefore. ISO standards adopted to enumerate indicator bacteria by Spanish legislation, and based on culturability, underestimate the bacterial population present in wastewater. We have compared two culture-independent methods for bacterial enumeration, microscopy and flow cytometry (FCM) and results indicate that FCM provides a rapid and automated quantification in WWTP. We conclude that microbiological parameters are essential to monitor the correct WWTP operation and we propose quantification of active bacteria as indicator of wastewater microbiological quality.

AB  - The invasive round goby has a recognised role in transferring contaminants through foodwebs, but little work has been done on contaminant impacts on round gobies themselves. Here we present the first case study of contaminant biomarkers and subpopulation structure variation in round gobies, in relation to habitat contamination, within a Canadian Area of Concern, Hamilton Harbour. Copper and cadmium were elevated in livers of fish from contaminated habitats. Although catch abundances were similar across sites, fish were smaller, a greater proportion of fish were female and more males were in reproductive condition in contaminated sites. Fish from contaminated areas showed more fin loss. Males from contaminated sites showed intersex gonads and genitalia. Ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) activity was higher in fish collected near polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-rich sediments. The results indicate that contaminants impact the characteristics of round goby populations, which could affect ecosystems beyond toxicant biomagnification. This study also confirms that round gobies can be abundant in polluted habitats, which may draw predators facilitating mobilisation of contaminants in foodwebs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Forty samples each of leaves of birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), European mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia (L.)) and bracken fem (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn) as well as spruce needles (Picea abies (L.) Karsten) were collected along a 120 km south-north transect running through Norway's largest city, Oslo. Concentrations of 25 chemical elements (Ag, Au, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sr, Ti, and Zn) as well as loss on ignition for the 4 sample materials are reported. The decline of input of sea spray with distance from the coast, geology, pH and anthropogenic contamination all played a role for the observed element concentrations in the leaves. Although growing under exactly the same natural conditions each plant species displayed quite unique uptake characteristics. Plant-species dependency and individual differences in the reaction of the plant leaves to different element sources make the investigated species of very limited value as bioindicators of anthropogenic activities. Anthropogenic contamination influences plant-leaf element content within a limited distance (similar to 20 km) from the source. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we present and discuss palynological results based on a composite profile from Birkat Ram crater lake (Northern Golan, Near East) in order to reconstruct the environmental history, including human impact, of the last 6500 years. Furthermore we apply a newly-developed botanical climatological transfer function to reconstruct climate variations in the northern Golan Heights based on this pollen data-set. The Birkat Ram record is strongly influenced by anthropogenic indicators in the pollen diagram with high quantities during the Chalcolithic period/Early Bronze Age, during the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine periods, during the Crusader period and finally during modern times. The palaeoclimate reconstruction method used is based on a Bayesian approach and is robust in avoiding the influence of these strong anthropogenic signals on the reconstruction results. The area has always had Mediterranean climate conditions and no distinctive climate changes can be identified during the past 6500 years. Because of the orography of the Mt. Hermon region the particular geographical position of the northern Golan Heights is obviously capable of buffering large-scale fluctuations in precipitation, which have otherwise been documented for several regions in the Near East.

AB  - In sustained forest management, it is particularly useful to test the adequacy of various silvicultural scenarios, but decision-making is also becoming increasingly complex because forest managers have to simultaneously meet several different objectives in response to society demands. In order to help forest managers make appropriate choices in silvicultural systems, we propose a SDSS (Silvicultural Decision Support System) that applies to pure and even-aged larch stands (Larix sp.) in lowland areas where site conditions are similar to those encountered in Southern Belgium. Its main purpose is (i) to predict the influence of silvicultural treatments on stand evolution and (ii) assist forest managers in comparing different scenarios with respect to predefined goals. This SDSS consists in three modules designed to elaborate silvicultural scenarios involving (i) stand growth prediction and thinning simulation; (ii) assessment of indicators selected to define the scenarios referring to wood production, financial, technico-economic and ecological components, tree stability and wood quality; and (iii) comparison of the scenarios on the basis of the set of previously assessed indicators (multi-criteria analysis). User-friendly "MGC_Larch" software helps managers to formulate, evaluate and compare different silvicultural scenarios for larch.

AB  - A simple and reliable technique for on line detection and diagnosis of scaling and fouling deposits could improve significantly operational control of RO plants. This paper presents results of an ongoing research project aiming to develop a novel method for online detection of membrane fouling by a residence time distribution (RTD) technique. The method is based on determination of flow dispersion intensities from online RTD signals that can be simply measured. The systems investigated in this paper are spiral wound membranes fouled with either Mg(OH)(2) or CaCO3. Analyses of RTD data of fouled membranes show that an increasing membrane permeability loss is accompanied by a systematic increase in the dispersion coefficient, thus providing an indicator for detecting a fouling event. It is also found that the magnitude of the dispersion coefficient is affected by deposit morphology, thus indicating the possibility for diagnosing the nature of the fouling deposit. Another fouling indicator may be derived from the observation that the extent of the dead volume monitored by the RTD signal increases with the fouling level while dead volumes are absent in clean modules.

AB  - Optical changes that accompanied a collapse of the population of filamentous cyanobacteria from a shallow, eutrophic lake were studied in laboratory-scale enclosures (LSEs). The experimental conditions are known, from previous work on these systems, to cause a dramatic collapse of the dominant algal or cyanobacterial species, which in turn can be associated with viral activity. Within 2 weeks of continuous addition of nutrient-rich growth medium, near-complete collapse of the dominant population occurred over the span of a few days. The collapse was repeatedly and reproducibly observed and was primarily characterized by a marked increase in water transparency. Scattering of light decreased by similar to 80%, absorption decreased by 20-80%. There was high similarity in optical changes between several experiments, carried out in different seasons. An increase of dissolved material and submicron-sized particles (SMP) that showed chlorophyll a (Chl a) absorption was observed during the collapse. The phycocyanin (PC): Chl a ratio and phaeopigment : Chl a ratio proved to be good indicators of the observed collapse. Reflectance spectra that were modelled using a constant volume-scattering function indicated that mass mortality of this magnitude can be detected in natural systems using current remote sensors.

AB  - The small recently infilled lake basin of Marcacocha (13degrees13'S, 72degrees12'W, 3355 m) in the Cuzco region of Peru has a morphology and location that renders it extremely sensitive to environmental change. A record of vegetation, human impact and climatic change during the past 4200 yr has been obtained from a highly organic core taken from the centre of the basin. Sustained arid episodes that affected the Peruvian Andes may be detectable using the proxy indicator of sedge (Cyperaceae) pollen abundances. As the lake-level was lowered during sustained drier conditions, the local catchment was colonised by Cyperaceae, whereas during lake floods, they retreated or were submerged and pollen production was correspondingly reduced. Drier episodes during prehistoric times occurred around 900 BC, 500 BC, AD 100 and AD 550, with a longer dry episode occurring from AD 900 to 1800. Evidence from the independently derived Quelccaya ice-core record and the archaeological chronology for the Cuzco region appears to support the climatic inferences derived from the sedge data. Many of these aridity episodes appear to correspond with important cultural changes in the Cuzco region and elsewhere in the Central Andes. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that changes in membrane potential influence the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes. To further elucidate the role of changes in membrane potential for their biological fate, the electrical behavior of keratinocytes needs to be studied under complex conditions such as multilayered cultures. However, electrophysiological recordings from cells in the various layers of a complex culture would be extremely difficult. Given the high spatial resolution of confocal imaging and the availability of novel voltage-sensitive dyes, we combined these methods in an attempt to develop a viable alternative for recording membrane potentials in more complex tissue systems. As a first step, we used confocal ratiometric imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based voltage-sensitive dyes. We then validated this approach by comparing the optically recorded voltage signals in HaCaT keratinocytes with the electrophysiological signals obtained by whole cell recordings of the same preparation. We demonstrate 1) that optical recordings allow precise multisite measurements of voltage changes evoked by the extracellular signaling molecules ATP and bradykinin and 2) that responsiveness to ATP differs in various layers of cultured keratinocytes.

AB  - The tolerance of microbenthic algal communities to two model toxicants, atrazine and copper, was studied in the Ter river during spring and summer. Artificial substrata were colonised at 9 sites and used to perform short-term (1-4 h) toxicity tests in the laboratory and to obtain photon yield as the ecotoxicological endpoint. The tolerance was lower in spring than in summer for both toxic substances and varied according to the site studied. Copper toxicity was associated with physico-chemical conditions (total suspended solids and water pH) and, especially, with several biomass-related parameters, whereas atrazine toxicity was related to algal abundance and species composition. Temporal and spatial changes in nutrient concentration may alter the biomass and species composition of the communities and thus affect their tolerance to toxic substances. It has to be therefore considered that the environmental characteristics of the river system may determine relevant direct and indirect effects on the algal communities, then affecting their specific ecotoxicological responses. Once this is assumed, the empirical expressions obtained on calculating EC50 and EC10 can be used to predict the community-level transient effects of toxic exposures.

AB  - Simultaneous measurements of ozone and-for the first time in Munich-of PAN were carried out at two sites in the urban area of Munich during two periods (16 June-15 September 1989 and 1 January-30 April 1990). Maximum mixing ratios reached 75 ppbv for ozone (10-min-average) and 5.6 ppbv for PAN (20-min-value), respectively. Ozone showed more pronounced diurnal variations than PAN. In both cases they were related to diurnal variations of the global radiation and the mixing ratios of NOx. Regarding ozone linear correlation analysis with meteorological parameters revealed distinct dependencies, especially on UV radiation, whereas the results for PAN reflected its more complicated formation. As far as dependencies on wind velocity are concerned, both ozone and PAN exhibited maximum mixing ratios in cases where the wind velocity was below 5 ms(-1). With increasing wind velocity both mixing ratios tended towards their natural background concentrations. Investigations concerning the influence of the wind direction did not disclose any particular local effects, but rather a relationship to the general weather situations. On the whole, PAN could be considered as a more characteristic indicator of smog conditions than ozone due to its low background concentrations and its thermal instability.

AB  - The application of new technologies such as the Internet of Things offers the opportunity to improve current agricultural development, facilitate daily tasks, and turn farms into efficient and sustainable production systems. The use of these new technologies enables the digital transformation process demanded by the sector and provides agricultural collectives with more optimized analysis and prediction tools. Due to climate change, one of the farm industry's problems is the advance or decay in the cycle of stone fruit trees. The objective is to recommend whether a specific area meets the minimum climatic requirements for planting certain stone fruit trees based on climatic data and bioclimatic indicators. The methodology used implements a large amount of meteorological data to generate information on specific climatic conditions and interactions on crops. In this work, a pilot study has been carried out in the Region of Murcia using an IoT platform. We simulate scenarios for the development of stone fruit varieties better adapted to the environment. Based on the standard, open interfaces, and protocols, the platform integrates heterogeneous information sources and interoperability with other third-party solutions to exchange and exploit such information.

AB  - Thermal refurbishment of buildings results in certain energy, financial, and environmental effects. Such investments are financially supported in Poland after meeting the legally defined conditions of thermal protection and energy consumption. This paper presents a complex thermal modernization of a school building, performed by following Polish regulations. A detailed description of the studied object was given, and the calculation procedure was described. Then an optimal variant of an investment and an ex-post analysis were described. Simple payback time (SPBT) of modernization measures was from 15.8 years (insulation of the ceiling under the unheated attic) to 87 years for insulation of the wooden external wall, with 35.6 years for the whole project, which is shorter than the predicted lifespan of the whole building (50-70 years). Annual calculated heating demand decreased from 464.78 to 168.73 GJ, resulting in the primary energy consumption indicator (EP) of 484.44 and 129.46 kWh/m(2), respectively. Thermal refurbishment with the replacement of an old boiler into a new wood-pellet one resulted in a significant reduction of SO2 and dust emissions from 451 to 27.5 kg and from 399 to 13 kg, respectively.

AB  - Since the 1990s, the Santa Isabel neighborhood in Santiago, Chile, has undergone a radical process of urban growth and densification which can be associated with the neoliberal turn that characterized public policies and urban growth since the 1980s. This global process of "urban neoliberalism" is characterized by the relevance that the private sector acquires in urban development of the cities, maximizing profitability over other considerations. The following article seeks to study the consequences of this type of neoliberal urban development in urban morphology on a neighborhood scale, as well as in the way in which the inhabitants relate to each other and with their territory. Through a multi-methodological approach, integrating census data, urban morphology indicators, survey results, field observations and in-depth interviews, it seeks to understand how this type of urban development that encourages the maximization of profits by private parties, affects the public dimension of urban space. It is identified that the characteristics of the built environment, added to its new sociodemographic composition, inhibit the use of the neighborhood, neighborhood sociability and the permanence of its inhabitants, contributing to generate a transitory neighborhood, which is transforming the own condition of the city.

AB  - The significance of crown transparency as forest health indicator has been frequently challenged. Here we examined crown transparency together with damage, crown productivity (shoot length) and leaf traits (needle weight, O and C stable isotopes, chlorophyll a fluorescence) on 9-27 Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. trees along an elevation gradient in Trentino, northern Italy. The gradient was assumed to represent several environmental stressors. A fully randomized sampling design was adopted and data were analyzed by means of one-way ANOVA and partial correlation. Results show that (i) crown transparency and visible damage on trees increase with elevation; (ii) such a pattern is consistent with a reduction of shoot length, needle weight, photosynthetic potential, and delta O-18. Even when the driving effect of elevation is controlled, significant relationships remain between crown transparency and needle weight and delta O-18. These results provide evidence that crown transparency reflects changes in tree condition and health, and are supportive of the use of crown transparency as a rapid method to monitor tree and forest health.

AB  - Biodegradation experiments were carried out with capsaicin to evaluate its degradability. The results show that capsaicin was readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions. The values of K. and the calculated bioconcentration factor indicate that capsaicin have a low potential for bioconcentration. The fish acute toxicity tests conducted with Brachydanio redo show LC50 for capsaicin was 5.98 mg L-1. The tests of alga growth inhibition conducted with Selenastrum capricornutum suggest EC50 for capsaicin was 10(-4) mg L-1. The calculated PNEC (Predicted No Effect Concentration) was 4.9 x 10(-4) mg L-1. The average PEC (Predicted Environmental Concentration) for OECD-EU commercial harbor and marina were 3.99 x 10(-6) and 2.49 x 10(-5) mg L-1, respectively. These indicate that the PEC was much less than the PNEC for capsaicin. The low K-P value of capsaicin suggests the data about the risk of capsaicin to sediment organisms can be waived. According to the results from the analysis of the degradation, bioaccumulation, toxicity and accumulation in sediment, it can be concluded that capsaicin used as active substance for antifouling system on ships poses relatively low risk to marine environment.

AB  - In this paper, a solar combi-system which consists of solar collectors and a carbon dioxide heat pump is proposed and investigated through simulation and optimization. Performance analysis and comparison are primarily conducted to show the feasibility and reasonability of using a CO2 heat pump as an auxiliary heater under local weather conditions. Then, a system model with a test building in TRNSYS is developed for performance optimization. The most influential variables are identified using influence and sensitivity analyzes of single parameters. Subsequently, a multi-parameter optimization using the high-weight parameters is carried out to obtain a final design result. The simulated results of the optimized case show that the average coefficient of performance of the CO2 heat pump is 2.38, and the solar fraction of the system is 69.0% for the entire heating season. The time when a comfortable temperature level can be achieved in the indoor environment accounts for 81.6% of the entire heating season. Furthermore, the performance characteristics of the proposed system are evaluated in terms of the thermal balance, fraction of the thermal energy saving, feasibility of net zero energy, economic factor, and CO2 emissions reduction.

AB  - Science has a critical role to play in guiding more sustainable development trajectories. Here, we present the Sustainable Amazon Network (Rede Amazonia Sustentavel, RAS): a multidisciplinary research initiative involving more than 30 partner organizations working to assess both social and ecological dimensions of land-use sustainability in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. The research approach adopted by RAS offers three advantages for addressing land-use sustainability problems: (i) the collection of synchronized and co-located ecological and socioeconomic data across broad gradients of past and present human use; (ii) a nested sampling design to aid comparison of ecological and socioeconomic conditions associated with different land uses across local, landscape and regional scales; and (iii) a strong engagement with a wide variety of actors and non-research institutions. Here, we elaborate on these key features, and identify the ways in which RAS can help in highlighting those problems in most urgent need of attention, and in guiding improvements in land-use sustainability in Amazonia and elsewhere in the tropics. We also discuss some of the practical lessons, limitations and realities faced during the development of the RAS initiative so far.

AB  - The decoupling of direct payments from production represents a substantial reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Farmers are no longer required to produce commodities to be entitled to support but only to keep land in Good Environmental and Agricultural Condition. If output declines as a result, there is concern that landscape services produced jointly with commodities will also decline. The aim of this paper is to assess the long-term effects of the 2003 reform on farm structure, landscape mosaic and biodiversity for a sample of EU regions. Impacts are quantified using a spatial agent-based modelling approach by simulating agricultural development with links to indicators of landscape value. Our results demonstrate that eliminating the link between support payments and production has possible negative consequences for the landscape, but only under particular circumstances. It is shown that these effects could be offset by strengthening (Pillar II) agri-environmental schemes. Further the single payment scheme results in higher land rental prices which reduces its ability to achieve its goal of providing income security for farmers. Implications of these results for the direction of continued CAP reform are discussed.

AB  - This paper describes an integrative method for quantifying, analyzing, and comparing the effects of alternative rehabilitation approaches with visual preference. The method was applied to a portion of a major industrial area located in southern Italy. Four alternative approaches to rehabilitation (alternative designs) were developed and analyzed. The scenarios consisted of the cleanup of the brownfields plus: (1) the addition of ground cover species; (2) the addition of ground cover species and a few trees randomly distributed; (3) the addition of ground cover species and a few trees in small groups; and (4) the addition of ground cover species and several trees in large groups. The approaches were analyzed and compared to the baseline condition through the use of cost-surface modeling (CSM) and visual preference assessment (VPA). Statistical results showed that alternatives that were more ecologically functional for forest bird species dispersal were also more visually preferable. Some differences were identified based on user groups and location of residence. The results of the study are used to identify implications for enhancing both ecological attributes and visual preferences of rehabilitating landscapes through planning and design.

AB  - Ratios of the fission products Cs-135 and Cs-137 were determined in soil and sediment samples contaminated from three different sources, to assess the use of Cs-135/Cs-137 as an indicator of source of radioactive contamination. Soil samples from the Chernobyl exclusion zone were found to have to be heavily depleted in Cs-135 (Cs-135/Cs-137 similar to 0.45), indicative of a high thermal neutron flux at the source. Sludge samples from a nuclear waste treatment pond were found to have a Cs-131/Cs-137 ratio of similar to 1, whereas sediment collected downstream from a nuclear reactor was highly variable in both Cs-137 activity and Cs-135/Cs-137 ratio. Comparison of these preliminary results of variability in radiocaesium isotope ratios with reports of Pu isotope ratios suggests Cs-135/Cs-137 Similarly varies with fuel and reactor conditions, and may be used to corroborate other methods of characterizing radioactive contamination.

AB  - . Bogs, economically valuable wetlands, are subjected to exploitation in southern Canada. We addressed plant conservation within bogs mined for peat, in which small undisturbed remnants are left, mostly at the margins of the mined areas. The main goal of the study was to test whether these remnants act as refuges for plants which could recolonize areas that are planned for restoration after mining is completed. Mosses, lichens and vascular plants were sampled in remnants of 24 mined bogs in southeastern Canada during the summer of 1997. The vegetation was also sampled at the margins and centres of 24 nearby natural bogs in plots similar in size to these remnants. Using similarity analysis and ordination techniques, we found that plant species assemblages in remnants of mined bogs differ from those near the margins of natural bogs, and that certain species are associated with the centre of natural bogs, due to the presence of pools. We also showed that water conditions of remnants are affected by drainage due to peat mining. Sphagnum moss showed itself to be a key indicator of mining effects on vegetation. Implications for peat resource management and bog conservation are discussed.

AB  - The determination of heavy metal concentrations in the tissues of biota is an accurate method to estimate the abundance and the bioavailability of metals in the marine environment. The concentration of Fe, Cr, Cu and Zn were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in molluscs, algae and angiosperms from a marine area adjacent to a ferronickel smelting plant (situated at North Evoikos Gulf, Greece), in order to investigate the spatial distribution of metals along the coast and their impact on marine benthic Life. Results showed higher levels of Fe and Cr in biota from the sampling sites situated near the smelting plant or the dumping site of the metalliferous slag in contrast with the obviously lower levels of the more distant sites. Molluscs showed generally higher concentrations of Fe and Cr in their tissues than plants. Cu and Zn were distributed quite uniformely in the tissues of the studied species. Furthermore the concentration of Fe and Cr in mussels collected from two localities at Evoikos Gulf and kept in clear seawater under experimental conditions decreased by almost 50% in comparison to their initial concentration within 18-48 hours of detoxification.

AB  - Bauxite residue is a highly alkaline waste from alumina refining, and is mainly disposed by stacking with high environmental risks. Here, the migration of alkaline constituents and the restoration evaluation with phosphogypsum were discussed by soil column experiments to investigate the alkaline regulation in bauxite residue disposal areas (BRDAs). The pH, free alkali, exchangeable sodium in the top layer (0-25 cm depth) covered with BR and phosphogypsum mixtures were reduced from 10.89 +/- 0.02, 285.45 +/- 21.15 mmol/kg, 385.63 +/- 30.34 mg/kg to 9.00 +/- 0.50, 12.50 +/- 1.50 mmol/kg, 97.00 +/- 10.50 mg/kg. For the sublayers, including depths of 35, 45, 55 cm, these values dropped to 9.86, 10.06, 10.03; 38.23, 86.12, 148.00 mmol/kg; 152.90, 246.00, 305.00 mg/kg, respectively. These results indicated alkaline indicators for phosphogypsum amended BR declined dramatically, and the parameters for sublayers were also decreased due to the migration of alkaline constituents. The physicochemical properties for amended BR could meet the conditions for plant growth. This research provided a reference for alkalinity regulation in BRDAs by phosphogypsum.

AB  - The work analyzed the scope of implementation of sustainable development (SD) goals resulting from the activities of entities dealing in the exploitation of lignite in Poland. As the stage requiring implementation of solutions in line with the SD objectives, the design phase was indicated. It has been shown that although there are a number of tools and guidelines that contribute to sustainable development, there is no consistent, integrated approach to supporting the national mining industry. The main goal of the article is to indicate the role of sustainable development in the context of mining projects designing, indicating the available tools (software) and guidelines (including industry-specific GRI). In addition, several SD indices were selected in the article. The considerations were placed in the socio-environmental sphere, on the example of the development of two Polish local government units, in which opencast mining plants function together with the development potential for the selected area with prospective deposits. It has been shown that municipalities in which mining activities are carried out, supplying their budgets, can carry out activities in accordance with the SD. This results in improving the living conditions of local communities, thus providing an opportunity for the future development of areas that can be designated for exploitation.

AB  - The study considers forest therapy as a tool for diversification of forest management. An up-to-date integrated approach for assessing and mapping potential of forest areas which could provide conditions for forest therapy services is developed and tested. It is based on combining data from the traditional forest inventory in Bulgaria and other open databases with methods for integrated assessment and mapping of ecosystem services: 7 criteria groups and 22 indicators are proposed, rated on a 5-point scale. Overlay analysis is applied to generate a composite assessment for each forest unit. Using spatial statistics tools, territorial hot spots with potential for forest therapy are identified. The methodology was successfully tested in a pilot case-study region, Smolyan Municipality, but it is applicable at broader scale, regardless of the type and ownership of forests. This approach could be transferred to other countries as well after adapting to their geographical, geoecological and socio-cultural specifics and database available. It is a cost-effective and informative tool to support forest owners and managers to diversify forest welfare services focusing on insufficiently used forest recreation potential.

AB  - The accumulation of prey remains in the pellets of the great gray owl in the winter and nesting periods was studied over a number of years at the contact of the taiga and northern forested steppe belts in the Trans-Urals. It is shown which of the characteristics of the hunting territory and the population of small mammals have the greatest effect on the composition and ratio of prey species. A comparison with the results of the feeding activity of the eagle owl was also made. Published information concerning four places of long-term nesting on rocks in the river valleys of the western slope of the Middle Urals in similar natural conditions was used as well. Selective accumulation of prey remains of these two owl species was revealed to lie in a small number of the main prey species, those mostly populating open habitats. In both owls, mammal species of closed forest (transitional) habitats served as concomitant (secondary) prey. The eagle owl was characterized by a large size range of prey. Special attention was paid to the indicator roles the concomitant prey play in paleoreconstructions.

AB  - According to climate change scenarios the incidence of extreme events, such as flooding, is expected to increase worldwide. In the current climate change context, understanding behavioural responses of marine species to such stressors is essential, especially for species of high ecological and economic interest such as bivalves, which can be quite useful for future management and conservation actions. In this study, a laboratory experiment using different salinity conditions was undertaken to assess potential behavioural responses of cockles (Cerastoderma edule), as a survival strategy facing low-salinity stress during riverine flood events. Results showed consistent patterns of burrowing/emergence of cockles facing salinity variation: with high salinities the individuals were observed buried in the sediment; when salinity decreased, organisms were observed to actively emerge, and when salinity was <10, cockles were found exposed at the sediment surface. These behavioural changes may be a strategy for the survival of this species in response to flooding: once at the sediment surface, hydrodynamics may transport organisms towards areas that are more suitable

AB  - Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) enable long-term monitoring of cellular and subcellular dynamics of this second messenger in response to environmental and developmental cues without relying on exogenous dyes. Continued development and optimization in GECIs, combined with advances in gene manipulation, offer new opportunities for investigating the mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in fungi, ranging from documenting Ca2+ signatures under diverse conditions and genetic backgrounds to evaluating how changes in Ca2+ signature impact calcium-binding proteins and subsequent cellular changes. Here, we attempted to express multi-color (green, yellow, blue, cyan, and red) circularly permuted fluorescent protein (FP)-based Ca2+ indicators driven by multiple fungal promoters in Fusarium oxysporum, F. graminearum, and Neurospora crassa. Several variants were successfully expressed, with GCaMP5G driven by the Magnaporthe oryzae ribosomal protein 27 and F. verticillioides elongation factor-1? gene promoters being optimal for F. graminearum and F. oxysporum, respectively. Transformants expressing GCaMP5G were compared with those expressing YC3.60, a ratiometric Cameleon Ca2+ indicator. Wild-type and three Ca2+ signaling mutants of F. graminearum expressing GCaMP5G exhibited improved signal-to-noise and increased temporal and spatial resolution and are also more amenable to studies involving multiple FPs compared to strains expressing YC3.60.

TI  - Water column gradients beneath the summer ice of a High Arctic freshwater lake as indicators of sensitivity to climate change
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Ice cover persists throughout summer over many lakes at extreme polar latitudes but is likely to become increasingly rare with ongoing climate change. Here we addressed the question of how summer ice-cover affects the underlying water column of Ward Hunt Lake, a freshwater lake in the Canadian High Arctic, with attention to its vertical gradients in limnological properties that would be disrupted by ice loss. Profiling in the deepest part of the lake under thick mid-summer ice revealed a high degree of vertical structure, with gradients in temperature, conductivity and dissolved gases. Dissolved oxygen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane rose with depth to concentrations well above air-equilibrium, with oxygen values at>150% saturation in a mid-water column layer of potential convective mixing. Fatty acid signatures of the seston also varied with depth. Benthic microbial mats were the dominant phototrophs, growing under a dim green light regime controlled by the ice cover, water itself and weakly colored dissolved organic matter that was mostly autochthonous in origin. In this and other polar lakes, future loss of mid-summer ice will completely change many water column properties and benthic light conditions, resulting in a markedly different ecosystem regime.

AB  - The interactions, negotiations and decision-making involved in environmental sustainability in the mining industry are intricate and multi-faceted. Negotiations between communities, companies, governments and countless other stakeholders occur predominantly during the permitting stage where potential impacts are estimated, management plans are established, site remediation is planned, and the sharing of benefits is discussed. Game theory is a structured tool that can investigate the interactions between two or more players to understand their actions under given conditions. There are many applications of game theory in economics, environmental economics, business, policy, and sciences; however, there are limited examples of applications in the mining industry. With a multi-criteria approach, this research develops five games to explore game theory for the mining industry. The games are developed to investigate scenarios that maximize both overall sustainability and environmental sustainability. A discussion is provided on the challenges of incorporating multi-criteria as well as the general issues with modelling environmental management problems with game theory for the mining industry. Finally, this paper concludes by providing future direction for further research and mineral policy.

AB  - Remote sensing, particularly using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, can be an effective tool in detecting and assessing the area and amount of building damages caused by earthquake or tsunami. Several studies have provided experimental evidence for the importance of polarimetric SAR observations in building damage detection and assessment, particularly caused by a tsunami. This study aims to evaluate the practical applicability of the polarimetric SAR observations to building damage caused by the direct ground-shaking of an earthquake. The urban areas heavily damaged by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in Japan have been investigated by using the polarimetric PALSAR-2 data acquired in pre- and post-earthquake conditions. Several polarimetric change detection approaches, such as the changes of polarimetric scattering powers, the matrix dissimilarity measures, and changes of the radar scattering mechanisms, were examined. Optimal damage indicators in the presence of significant natural changes, and a novel change detection method by the fuzzy-based fusion of polarimetric damage indicators are proposed. The accuracy analysis results show that the proposed automatic classification method can successfully detect the selected damaged areas with a detection rate of 90.9% and false-alarm rate of 1.3%.

AB  - Uncertainty is a standard condition under which large parts of art-historical and curatorial knowledge creation and communication are operating. In contrast to standard levels of data quality in non-historical research domains, historical object and knowledge collections contain substantial amounts of uncertain, ambiguous, contested, or plainly missing data. Visualization approaches and interfaces to cultural collections have started to represent data quality and uncertainty metrics, yet all existing work is limited to representations for isolated metadata dimensions only. With this article, we advocate for a more systematic, synoptic and self-conscious approach to uncertainty visualization for cultural collections. We introduce omnipresent types of data uncertainty and discuss reasons for their frequent omission by interfaces for galleries, libraries, archives and museums. On this basis we argue for a coordinated counter strategy for uncertainty visualization in this field, which will also raise the efforts going into complex interface design and conceptualization. Building on the PolyCube framework for collection visualization, we showcase how multiple uncertainty representation techniques can be assessed and coordinated in a multi-perspective environment. As for an outlook, we reflect on both the strengths and limitations of making the actual wealth of data quality questions transparent with regard to different target and user groups.

AB  - Following an initial, brief, review of the environmental problems associated with the use of lead based primers, and also some of their potential replacements, this study investigated the preparation of the promising, lead free, energetic material nickel hydrazine nitrate by different methods. All three methods trialed produced the same, analytically indistinguishable, compound but with minor changes in visual appearance. The solution properties governing the precipitation process were investigated in a controlled pH titration experiment. Product solubility in a number of common solvents was investigated. Aqueous ammonia and hydrazine hydrate proved the best "non-destructive solvents" for the solid. UV spectroscopy and conductivity of the solutions obtained was used as an indicator of the processes involved in the solubility. Using the critical pH conditions for precipitation from aqueous solutions of hydrazine and nickel nitrate the formation constant for the tris hydrazine complex was determined. Also using the solubility of the tris-hydrazine complex in concentrated hydrazine hydrate an equilibrium constant for the formation of the soluble hexa-hydrazine complex from insoluble tris hydrazine complex was determined. These values were compared with similar values for nickel hydrazine complexes with other anions. The origins of these differences were discussed. Further work on controlling and measuring the particle size of the NiHN produced should be considered.

AB  - Virulent brood parasites refrain from arduous parental care, often kill host progeny and inflict rearing costs upon their hosts. Quantifying the magnitude of such costs across the whole period of care (from incubation through to parasite fledgling independence) is essential for understanding the selection pressures on hosts to evolve antiparasitic defences. Despite the central importance of such costs for our understanding of coevolutionary dynamics, they have not yet been comprehensively quantified in any host of any avian brood parasite. We quantified parasite-rearing costs in common redstarts Phoenicurus phoenicitrus raising either parasitic common cuckoo Cuculus canorus or their own chicks throughout the complete breeding cycle, and used multiple cost parameters for each breeding stage: incubation, brooding and feeding effort; length of parental/host care; parent/host body condition; and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (stress-level indicator). Contrary to traditional assumptions, rearing the parasite per se was not associated with overall higher physiological or physical costs to hosts above the natural levels imposed by efforts to rear their own progeny. The low parasite-rearing costs imposed on hosts may, in part, explain the low levels of known host counter-defences in this unusually frequently parasitized cuckoo host.

AB  - Shopping is an almost universal characteristic of public and private life. Consumer behavior is a set of relatively stable configurations of the micro-level practices that reflect the essential characteristics of social contexts of different scales. Its historical evolution proceeds from the purchase of a single product to the purchase of lifestyle scenes in the shopping form in shopping centers (malls). In Russia, this process coincided with the belated transition from deficit society to the formation of a consumer society (1990-2000-ies.). A new type of society, which has an attribute of shopping and entertainment (SEC), is focal and disseminated within the logic of social and territorial hierarchy: from the capital to the regional centers, and from them to the remote area. Currently, this process has reached the regional capitals, soaking into the district centers. Under the new conditions the nature and extent of shopping are one of the most important indicators of quality of life (the important issue is not only what people are buying, but also how they do it). The article provides a review of this process on the basis of secondary analysis of statistical data and field research in a number of regional centers of the European part of Russia.

AB  - Total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation at a southern California beach involved ultraviolet treatment of watershed drainage that provided >97% reduction in fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations. However, this pollutant control measure did not provide sufficient improvement of beach water quality, prompting further assessment. Investigation included microbial source tracking (MST) for human, gull, and canine fecal sources, monitoring of enterococci and fecal coliform, and measurement of chemical and physical water quality parameters for samples collected from watershed, groundwater, and beach sites, including a beach scour pond and tidal creek. FIB variability remained poorly modeled in regression analysis. However, MST revealed correlations between FIB and gull source tracking markers, leading to recommendations to manage gulls as a pollutant source. Beach conditions were followed for three years after implementation of a best management practice (BMP) to abate gulls using a falconry program for the beach and an upland landfill. The gull abatement BMP was associated with improved beach water quality, and this appears to be the first report of falconry in the context of TMDL implementation. Overall, MST data enabled management action despite an inability to fully model FIB dynamics in the coupled watershed beach system.

AB  - Direction-dependent separation distances to avoid odour annoyance, calculated with the Gaussian Austrian Odour Dispersion Model AODM and the Lagrangian particle diffusion model LASAT at two sites, are analysed and compared. The relevant short-term peak odour concentrations are calculated with a stability-dependent peak-to-mean algorithm. The same emission and meteorological data, but model specific atmospheric stability classes are used. The estimate of atmospheric stability is obtained from three-axis ultrasonic anemometers using the standard deviations of the three wind components and the Obukhov stability parameter. The results are demonstrated for the Austrian villages Reidling and Weissbach with very different topographical surroundings and meteorological conditions. Both the differences in the wind and stability regimes as well as the decrease of the peak-to-mean factors with distance lead to deviations in the separation distances between the two sites. The Lagrangian model, due to its model physics, generally calculates larger separation distances. For worst-case calculations necessary with environmental impact assessment studies, the use of a Lagrangian model is therefore to be preferred over that of a Gaussian model. The study and findings relate to the Austrian odour impact criteria. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy and resource consumptions required to treat and transport wastewater have led to efforts to improve the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Resource recovery can reduce the environmental impact of these systems; however, limited research has considered how the scale of implementation impacts the sustainability of WWTPs integrated with resource recovery. Accordingly, this research uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate how the scale of implementation impacts the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment integrated with water reuse, energy recovery, and nutrient recycling. Three systems were selected: a septic tank with aerobic treatment at the household scale, an advanced water reclamation facility at the community scale, and an advanced water reclamation facility at the city scale. Three sustainability indicators were considered: embodied energy, carbon footprint, and eutrophication potential. This study determined that as with economies of scale, there are benefits to centralization of WWTPs with resource recovery in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint; however, the community scale was shown to have the lowest eutrophication potential. Additionally, technology selection, nutrient control practices, system layout, and topographical conditions may have a larger impact on environmental sustainability than the implementation scale in some cases.

AB  - Based on various adsorption characteristics of resins, a novel method for purifying and preparing moenomycin A from fermentation broth was established by combining different chromatographic modes into a three-step preparative chromatography process. Fermentation broth of moenomycins was firstly prepurified by macroporous adsorbent XAD7HP to remove most strong polar impurities, then further purified by anion exchange resin FPA98Cl, and finally refined moenomycin A was obtained by use of semi-preparative reversed-phase chromatographic column packed with Chromtorex C8 silica gel. As the main indicators, purity and yield of moenomycin A were examined in order to optimise the chromatographic process for each step. Under optimized chromatographic conditions, the purity and total yield of moenomycin A were 95.0 and 22.2 %, and the biological potency of moenomycin A was 2232 U mg(-1), significantly higher than 1395 U mg(-1), which is the potency of the standard from Agriculture Ministry of China. Three-step preparative chromatographic mode could gradually and effectively remove impurities. The present method is practical, easy to be operated with less solvent consumption, and provides a new idea for the preparation of moenomycin A with high purity.

AB  - Springs are autochthonous aquatic ecotones with complex functional properties and heterogeneous eco-morphological structures. Within a small spatial extent, invertebrates are highly diverse and mainly composed of species adapted to the surface-subterranean water interface, the aquatic-terrestrial interface or to the spring habitat itself. In this publication, a first synopsis of limno-ecological case studies of springs from the Lowlands of Schleswig-Holstein, the low mountain ranges of Hesse and Thuringia, the pre-Alps of the Jura Mountains in Switzerland and the Alps in Germany and Switzerland is presented. The field surveys conducted in the different areas focus on an ecological assessment of spring habitats, distribution patterns of the invertebrate fauna and specific regional characteristics. A regional faunistic differentiation of spring-related invertebrate species is evident. A change in the faunistic composition in general and a loss of crenobionts owing to climatic and land-use changes are expected. In addition, it should be noted that long-term monitoring data required to make reliable statements about future developments in the distribution of spring species and to predict habitat conditions are not available.

AB  - The study examined relationships among meteorological parameters, water quality and diarrheal disease counts in two urban and three rural sites in Tamil Nadu, India. Disease surveillance was conducted between August 2010 and March 2012; concurrently water samples from street-level taps in piped distribution systems and from household storage containers were tested for pH, nitrate, total dissolved solids, and total and fecal coliforms. Methodological advances in data collection (concurrent prospective disease surveillance and environmental monitoring) and analysis (preserving temporality within the data through time series analysis) were used to quantify independent effects of meteorological conditions and water quality on diarrheal risk. The utility of a local calendar in communicating seasonality is also presented. Piped distribution systems in the study area showed high seasonal fluctuations in water quality. Higher ambient temperature decreased and higher rainfall increased diarrheal risk with temperature being the predominant factor in urban and rainfall in rural sites. Associations with microbial contamination were inconsistent; however, disease risk in the urban sites increased with higher median household total coliform concentrations. Understanding seasonal patterns in health outcomes and their temporal links to environmental exposures may lead to improvements in prospective environmental and disease surveillance tailored to addressing public health problems.

AB  - A pilot study of bioindicators of environmental health was performed in a non-industrial region of Poland in April 2008. Twenty wild-caught northern pike Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1758 were used. Established biomarkers of environmental stress were studied in these fish, including condition factor, macroscopic lesions, morphometry of hepatic melanomacrophage cells, follicular atresia, and histopathology of liver and gonads. Body weight, total body length, and gender were recorded; livers, gonads, and organs with macroscopic lesions were collected for histopathology. H&E-stained paraffin-embedded sections were studied by light microscopy. All fish appeared in good health and had no macroscopic lesions except for two fish with gut trematodes. Microscopic lesions were minimal and included peribiliary fibrosis and cholangitis, focal hepatic necrosis and vasculitis, biliary myxozoanosis, intestinal metazoan parasites, and post-spawning peritonitis. Very low levels of hepatic MMC and ovarian follicular atresia were found. The data constitute the first report of biomarkers of environmental stress in northern pike from northeastern Poland and can be used as a reference for future monitoring of fish health and aquatic pollution in this region.

AB  - The possibility of marine discharge of a negatively buoyant industrial waste was evaluated by a modeling study using Killworth 3-D, which is the first version of the Modular Ocean Model (MOM). The Model was run with the recorded wind direction and speed on the cruise dates and the circulation patterns for surface and subsurface were found to be similar with the current meter measurements. Model scenarios have been set-up in order to estimate the intensity and direction of the currents in the Nemrut Bay under the condition of wind blowing from a definite direction for a long time. MOM model has been run for four major wind directions, each having duration of 10 days and the behavior of the discharge plume in the worst case has been traced. Also, the behavior of the discharge plume in the real case has been estimated by using the wind data of the region. According to the model results, impact of trace elements that compose the discharge effluent is limited both in time and space. It is concluded that trace elements will leave the Bay in a short time due to the short residence times.

AB  - The pattern of seasonal development of rhododendrons, as well as of all other introduced plants, in the conditions of a specific region is one of the most reliable indicators of their positive acclimatization. One of the most important indicators is the time and duration of the production of generative structures. The grouping of these plants into phenorhythmotypes made it possible to evaluate the indicators characterizing the flowering peculiarities of rhododendrons.
   We assessed flowering peculiarities of 37 deciduous and 89 evergreen or semi-evergreen taxa and cultivars of rhododendrons (1-7 individuals of each taxa and cultivars) that had reached the generative status of biological maturity, but a different calendar age. The rhododendrons grown in Northern Lithuania were grouped into specific phenorhythmotypes according to indicators of flowering beginning, flowering ending and average duration of flowering.
   According to indicators of flowering beginning and flowering ending, the rhododendrons were classified into phenorhythmotypes of 1) especially early, 2) early, 3) rather late, and 4) especially late. According to flowering duration, the rhododendrons were divided into phenorhythmotypes of 1) short flowering duration, 2) medium flowering duration and 3) long flowering duration. These results are relevant for grouping different types of rhododendrons intended for planting in green areas of urban territories.

AB  - Buccal microwear patterns on teeth are good indicators of the abrasiveness of foodstuffs and have been used to trace the dietary habits of fossil species, including primates and hominids. However, few studies have addressed the variability of this microwear. The abrasiveness of dietary components depends not only on the hardness of the particles ingested, but also on the presence of dust and other exogenous elements introduced during food processing. These elements are responsible for the microwear typology observed on the enamel surfaces of primate teeth. Here we analyzed the variability of buccal microwear patterns in African Great Apes (Gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes), using tooth molds obtained from the original specimens held in several osteological collections. Our results suggest that ecological adaptations at subspecies or population level account for differences in microwear patterns, which are attributed to habitat and ecological conditions within populations rather than differences between species. The findings from studies on the variability of buccal dental microwear in extant species will contribute to a better understanding of extinct hominids' diet and ecology.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of forest plantations on the physical, chemical and microbiological attributes of a cerrado Oxisol. Soil samples were collected at 0-10 cm depth from sites cultivated with pinus (Pinus tecunumanii), eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus grandis) and carvoeiro (Sclerolobium paniculatum) for over 20 years. An adjacent native cerrado area was used as a reference of the original soil conditions. It was observed in relation to the native cerrado: increases in soil density under pinus and eucalyptus, reduction in the macroporosity under pinus, lower organic matter contents under pinus and eucalyptus, besides decreases in the soil pH and in the base saturation under pinus and carvoeiro along with an increase in aluminum saturation. Soil microbial biomass carbon under the pinus, eucalyptus and carvoeiro sites was about half of that found under cerrado. The activities of acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase were inhibited by pinus and stimulated by carvoeiro. Among the forest systems evaluated, pinus promoted the greatest reduction on soil quality. The microbiological variables were the most sensitive to detect the effects of these systems on soil quality.

AB  - Complications arise when ratios are used to present environmental data because ratios are an unbounded, multiplicative scale that can lead to asymmetrical (skewed) data distributions. Enantiomeric ratios (ERs), historically used in discussions of chiral signatures, often are published as mean ER +/- single-value standard deviation. Application of statistical summaries, such as the widely used sample mean and standard deviation, to skewed ratio data is misleading and often inappropriate. Comparison of statistically summarized ER and enantiomer fraction (EF) data (which are based on a bounded, additive scale) for a range of hypothetical values reveals substantial discrepancies when conversion between ER and EF formats is used. These discrepancies are largest when the ratio data are greater than one and have large variability, because the data are more skewed. In many cases, the use of fractions instead of ratios can help to minimize misrepresentation of environmental data, including chiral data. The use of nonparametric statistical summaries, e.g., median and percentiles, provides a more robust indicator of the typical value and spread for both ER and EF data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The modern state of scientific investigations for regional assessment and mapping of the natural groundwater resources is characterized. The main methods for regional assessment of the natural groundwater resources (river hydrograph separation by genetic recharge species for a long-term period, hydrodynamic methods, methods for perennial water-balance assessment for water recharge or discharge areas), their advantages and limitations are discussed. It is noted that the use of these methods for regional assessment of natural groundwater resources and groundwater runoff is based on analyzing and processing available hydrological and hydrogeological information and does not demand special expensive drilling and pumping tests. it is suggested to assess specific groundwater discharge modules, characterizing groundwater flow in I l/s per I km(2), the coefficient of groundwater discharge, characterizing groundwater recharge by infiltration in percent from the precipitation volume, and the coefficient of river recharge by groundwater, indicating the contribution of groundwater in the total river runoff, as the main quantitative characteristics of natural groundwater resources. The above-mentioned methods and quantitative characteristics of natural groundwater resources were used for compiling different scale maps of groundwater discharge for separate large regions, countries, central and eastern Europe, as well as the map of hydrogeological conditions and groundwater discharge of the world.

TI  - Performance of a bycatch reduction device in the shrimp fishery of the Gulf of California, Mexico
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Although shrimp fisheries are of great economic importance worldwide, they produce serious ecological disturbances and affect other resource harvesting activities such as small-scale fisheries. We tested performance of the Square Mesh/Extended Funnel bycatch reduction device (BRD) in the bottom trawl shrimp fishery of the Gulf of California. Efficiency of the BRD was determined under controlled conditions in terms of exclusion rate of fish bycatch, shrimp-capture loss and exclusion of certain fish species selected as indicators. Average exclusion rate for finfish species was 37% and that for shrimp, 7%. Total bycatch was decreased by 40% in comparison to the control trawl (no BRD). Extrapolation of this result to the entire commercial fleet suggests that BRD use would allow the exclusion of 73 thousand tons of bycatch per year in the Gulf. Their use would also help the recovery of certain endangered species, such as Totoaba macdonaldi. For this endemic fish, the exclusion rate of juveniles in our trials was 81%. An economic analysis showed that with a shrimp-capture loss of 7%, an average shrimp boat will continue to realize profits, but that opportunity costs could make this type of shrimping financially unattractive.

AB  - This study forms part of a larger project in which five planimetric parameters have been used to study changes in the digestive epithelium of Littorina littorea under different environmental and physiological conditions. Our aim was to examine the effect of the reproductive cycle on these parameters in order to assess their usefulness as indicators of stress.
   A one way anova shows that the absolute parameters of mean epithelial thickness (MET), mean diverticulum radius (MDR) and mean luminal radius (MLR) vary significantly depending on the time of the year. This variation is highly correlated to the amount of digestive tissue present and hence negatively correlated to the reproductive state because gonad and digestive tissue volume are inversely related. Consequently, these parameters are not good indicators of stress. However, whereas the absolute size of the digestive acinus varies with the reproductive state of the animal, the MET, MDR and MLR retain the same proportions and therefore the ratios MET/MDR and MLR/MET remain constant. This makes them useful indicators of stress because they are independent of intrinsic variables such as the reproductive cycle.

AB  - The main objective of the article is an attempt to identify factors/determinants conditioning the development of enterprises in Poland in recent years. The author will also try to indicate the dominant behaviours related to the notion of entrepreneurship among the owners of the enterprises under study. In addition to the literature analysis, the author chosea survey in the form of a structured interview with business owners as another research method - the survey was carried out in 2015 and 2017 and in 2019/2020 in 200 purposively selected enterprises from the SME sector, which are based in Poland and were established in the last 5 years. After the analysis of the literature and the results of the conducted survey, obviously bearing in mind its pilot character, the author clarified the names of the selected indicators/determinants and expanded their list by those he considered useful from the point of view of the general purpose of the survey - 9 indicators/determinants. In the author's opinion, the developed indicators/determinants make it possible to assess the level of enterprise development (direction and pace of changes) depending on selected factors of the local and institutional environment, internal factors, the level of achieved financial results, sources of financing.

AB  - We tested the potential for sand calcites to serve as a novel paleoclimate archive by investigating their age and formation conditions. Fontainebleau sand calcites are Pleistocene in age (based on C-14 and U-Th dating) and were primarily formed during glacial periods. delta C-13 values increase with the depth at which these sand calcites formed, consistent with open and closed CO2 systems. Interpretation of the delta O-18-T relationship in sand calcites points primarily to their formation at a low temperature, around 2 degrees C in shallow ground water and at about 9 degrees C in deeper ground-water settings. Their occurrence, characteristics, and compositions suggest crystallization from paleo-ground waters in permafrost environments. Crystallization of sand calcites was triggered by degassing of cold carbonate-containing surface waters as they infiltrated warmer subsurface ground-water environments. We consider sand calcites to be important indicators of interactions between meteoric water and ground water in Pleistocene periglacial landscapes. Their disposition may point to specific features of periglacial landscapes, and their ages could permit an assessment of landscape incision rates. Large crystals and zoned spheroliths may, in fact, encapsulate continuous high-resolution records of continental glacial and periglacial paleoenvironments.

AB  - Image segmentation is an essential analysis tool in the field of computer vision, and the level set method has been widely used in image segmentation. Specifically, the edge-based level set models can reduce many undesired regions because they mainly rely on the edge information. However, the edge-based level set models are usually sensitive to the initial condition, which limits their application. To overcome this shortcoming, a global-to-local region-based indicator is designed in this paper, which is utilized to embed the region information into the edge-based models. Unlike the edge-based indicator frequently used in the edge-based models, the proposed region-based indicator can allow bidirectional motion of the active contour curve according to the region information. In general, the proposed region-based indicator can intrinsically incorporate the edge information and region information into one single energy function. Experimental results on synthetic images, natural images and medical images validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with some other level set models, the proposed method generally achieves better performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wi-Fi-based positioning technology has been recognised as a useful and important technology for location-based service (LBS) accompanied by the rapid development and application of smartphones since the beginning of the 21(st) century. However, no mature technology or method of Wi-Fi-based positioning had provided a satisfying output in the past 20 years, until recently, when the IEEE 802.11mc standard was released and hardware-supported in the market, in which a fine time measurement (FTM) protocol and multiple round-trip time (RTT) was used for more accurate and robust ranging without the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) involved. This paper provided an evaluation and ranging offset correction approach for Wi-Fi FTM based ranging. The characteristics of the ranging offset deviation errors are specifically examined through two well-designed evaluation tests. In addition, the offset deviation errors from a CompuLab WILD router and a Google access point (AP) are also compared. An average of 0.181 m accuracy was achieved after a typical offset correction process to the ranging estimates obtained from a complex surrounding environment with line-of-sight (LOS) condition. The research outcome will become a useful resource for implementing other algorithms such as machine learning and multi-lateration for our future research projects.

AB  - We developed a Localized Disaster Risk Management Index (DRMI) that measures how well local government units (LGUs) in the Philippines prepare for a disaster. Focusing on LGUs that have experienced at least one of the four hydrometeorological hazards, strong winds and rain, floods, landslide/mudslide, and big waves, we capture in one number the ex post and ex ante risk management strategies that influence post disaster outcomes. Given the nature of our data, we used the iterative principal component analysis to compute for the LGUs' Localized DRMI, which was then correlated with conditions, outcomes, and social indicators. Our results show a negative correlation between localized DRMI and recovery, which means that LGUs with high Localized DRMI scores are also those that have not fully recovered. This does not mean that these LGUs would be better off having lower scores. This result implies LGUs that perform well in terms of Localized DRMI scores are also those that frequently experience very severe disasters due to hydrometeorological hazards. Just as they are recovering from a disaster, another one hits them. This is corroborated by other correlation results: positive for severity and frequency, positive for poverty, and negative for LGUs' revenue.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - There is now an extensive body of academic literature examining how the environmental movement contributed to the colonization of Indigenous peoples and development of capitalism in northern Canada. This paper contributes to these discussions by considering how environmental assessment (EA) helped enable hydrocarbon extraction in the Qikiqtani (Baffin Island) region of Nunavut in the 1970s and 1980s. When exploration activities began to threaten the Inuit harvesting economy, communities protested with letters and petitions. The federal government responded to Inuit resistance by referring proposed exploratory drilling and extraction to its new EA process. While Inuit won significant victories during some assessments of proposed exploratory drilling and extraction, federal EA ultimately helped create the conditions for Inuit to consent to oil extraction. EA helped impose material compromises between Inuit and hydrocarbon industries, including preferential hiring of Inuit, a reduction in the scope of proposed extraction, and the rejection of especially controversial proposals for offshore drilling. These concessions, combined with a collapse in the market for sealskins due to international boycotts, persuaded several Qikiqtani communities to support oil extraction in the 1980s. The ensuing extraction and export of oil from the High Arctic accelerated processes of colonial dispossession and reinforced colonial political dynamics.

AB  - Levonorgestrel (LNG) and quinestrol (QUN) are typical endocrine disruptors that enter the soil via sewage irrigation and sludge return. However, the fates of both compounds in soil are not well-understood. Laboratory microcosm studies were conducted to fill the gap of understanding of LNG and QUN behavior in soils. High values of goodness-of-fit indices (GFIs) were obtained using the double-first-order in parallel (DFOP) model and the single-first-order (SFO) model to fit the degradation kinetics of LNG and QUN in soils, respectively. The end-points (DT50 and DT90) of LNG and QUN were positively correlated with soil total organic carbon (TOC). Soil water content and temperature were observed to be critical factors in degradation of LNG and QUN. The degradation rates of LNG and QUN were very slow under sterile and flooded conditions, indicating that the aerobic microbial degradation was dominant in the degradation of LNG and QUN. Moreover, major transformation products were identified, and biodegradation pathways of LNG and QUN were proposed. The present study is expected to provide basic information for ecological risk assessment of LNG and QUN in the soil compartment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different housing systems on behaviour and growth performance of fattening pigs. Forty Duroc x Meishan pigs aged 100 d were assigned into two housing systems: indoor deep litter (DL) housing (4 pens with 5 pigs/pen) and indoor pen with outdoor playground (PG; 4 pens with 5 pigs/pen). Pig behaviour, body weight, and feed intake were recorded and analysed. Results showed that DL pigs spent more time exploring (DL: 231.0 vs. PG: 178.0 s/h, P < .01), while PG pigs were more aggressive (PG: 6.6 vs. DL: 0.4 s/h, P < .01) and engaged in higher levels of abnormal behaviour (PG: 20.0 vs. DL: 3.2 s/h, P < .01), specifically stereotyped behaviour and mouth-holding/biting tail. No difference was observed for the final body weight and feed conversion efficiency. The results of this study suggest that the DL system improves pig welfare at aspects of exploratory behaviour and abnormal behaviour compared with the PG housing system under the conditions studied, providing a basis for the selection and design of optimum housing systems for pigs.

AB  - The service condition of the overhead line insulators is significantly affected by the contamination deposited on the insulator surfaces. The reliability of transmission lines is therefore affected in the case of insulator failures. Leakage current signature has widely been reported to be a good indicator of the contamination level on the insulators. Different characteristics extracted from leakage current can be used to sense and classify insulators based on their contamination levels. In this paper, a method based on short time modified Hilbert transform (STMHT) and sparse representation-based contamination level sensing of overhead line insulator has been proposed. STMHT is capable of enhancing the local characteristic of the leakage current waveform and provides a good technique for differentiating between similar kinds of data. Sparse representation-based classification is used for classification of the extracted features. Results show that the performance is comparable or even better with respect to the results reported in the literature. The present method is generic in nature and can be implemented for any other applications addressing topologically similar problems. All necessary experiments are conducted based on IEC 60507 standard.

AB  - We present a practical method to control erosion and soil conservation for agrarian activity. The method consists of four steps: (1) analyse the erosive state (as a percentage of the area affected) and soil losses (in m(3) ha (1)) by means of visual indicators (physical features on the soil surface that have been formed by erosion) and analyse environmental factors (as possible erodibility factors); (2) determine the factors of erodibility; (3) calculate the erosion threshold (value of the erodibility factor beyond which effective control of erosion is achieved), by statistical analysis of the databases collected in the field; (4) verify this result by applying a qualitative assessment of erosive intensity, using visual indicators. The erosion threshold is of particular interest for practical purposes because it can be used to improve the planning of agricultural activity, from the standpoint of soil conservation, thus promoting sustainable land use. This study makes the following main contributions to knowledge in this field:
   It presents a new method to address erosion control, based on determining the erosion threshold.
   Appropriate environmental and management conditions for effective erosion control are identified.
   The method is simple to apply, which facilitates its implementation. (C) 2018 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extensive agricultural losses are attributed to heat, often combined with drought. These abiotic stresses occur in the field simultaneously, namely in areas with Mediterranean climate, where grapevine traditionally grows. The available scenarios for climate change suggest an increase in the frequency of heat waves and severe drought events in summer, also affecting the South of Portugal. In this work we monitored several production-related parameters and evaluated the state of the oxidative stress response apparatus of two grapevine varieties, Touriga Nacional (TN) and Trincadeira (TR), with and without irrigation, during three field seasons (2010 to 2012). Overall, results point to a high correlation of most yield and stress-associated parameters with the specific characteristics of each variety and to each season rather than the irrigation treatments. In the season with the driest winter, 2012, the lack of irrigation significantly affected yield in TR, while in the two other seasons the impact of the irrigation regime was much lower. In 2012, the yield of TN was affected by environmental conditions of the previous season. The irrigation treatments significantly affected berry size rather than quality.

AB  - We inventoried lichens in Lake Clark (LACL) and Katmai (KATM) National Parks and Preserves. We assembled the known information on lichens in these parks by combining field, herbarium, and literature studies. Our results provide baseline data on lichen occurrence that may be used in resource condition assessments, vulnerability assessments, long-term ecological monitoring, and resource management. We report a total of 896 taxa of lichenized fungi from the Parks, adding 889 taxa to the total of seven taxa reported for the Parks by the National Park Service database and including ten new species first published elsewhere. An additional 15 lichenicolous fungi are reported here. Seven non-lichenized fungi associated with young living twigs of particular host species are also included. Sixteen species are new to Alaska, and six species new to North America (Caloplaca fuscorufa, Lecanora leucococca s.l., Ochrolechia brodoi, Protoparmelia memnonia, and Rhizocarpon leptolepis). Four new combinations are made, Cetraria minuscula, Enchylium millegranum var. bachmanianum, Lathagrium undulatum var. granulosum, and Protomicarea alpestris. Additional new species based on collections from the Parks have been described in separate publications.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate haematological and biochemical parameters with response to milk production of Jersey cows at high altitude in 2 different seasons (summer and winter). For each period, ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded and the temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated as indicator of thermal comfort zone for cattle. Clinically healthy lactating Jersey crossbred cows (70: 70 in each season) were selected for this study. A significant increase in RBC, Hb, and HCT was recorded in winter as compared to summer. Furthermore, MCV, MCH, MCHC and PLT levels also exhibited the similar trend; whereas, the WBC, lymphocyte, monocytes, and granulocytes values were higher in summer compared to winter. Glucose and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level showed a significant increase in summer but level of albumin went significantly higher in winter. Milk production level was significantly higher in summer. These results provided an insight into the haematological and biochemical responses of Jersey crossbred cows to different environmental conditions. Hence, this study will be helpful for the better dairy cattle management in different seasons for higher production at the cold arid high altitude region.

AB  - The present study describes the development of a neurocognitive paradigm: "Assessing Neurocognition via Gamified Experimental Logic" (ANGEL), for performing the parametric evaluation of multiple neurocognitive functions simultaneously. ANGEL employs an audiovisual sensory motor design for the acquisition of multiple event related potentials (ERPs)-the C1, P50, MMN, N1, N170, P2, N2pc, LRP, P300, and ERN. The ANGEL paradigm allows assessment of 10 neurocognitive variables over the course of three "game" levels of increasing complexity ranging from simple passive observation to complex discrimination and response in the presence of multiple distractors. The paradigm allows assessment of several levels of rapid decision making: speeded up response vs. response-inhibition; responses to easy vs. difficult tasks; responses based on gestalt perception of clear vs. ambiguous stimuli; and finally, responses with set shifting during challenging tasks. The paradigm has been tested using 18 healthy participants from both sexes and the possibilities of varied data analyses have been presented in this paper. The ANGEL approach provides an ecologically valid assessment (as compared to existing tools) that quickly yields a very rich dataset and helps to assess multiple ERPs that can be studied extensively to assess cognitive functions in health and disease conditions.

AB  - Few studies have examined how grazing intensity affects small Australian desert vertebrates, despite the large extent of the grazing industry and its potential effects on native biota. We examined small reptile, amphibian and mammal responses to two intensities ("grazed" and "less-grazed") of cattle grazing in the stony plains system of arid South Australia. The study was undertaken during wet La Nia conditions when abundance of most species was expected to be highest. Total rainfall over the study period was over twice the mean yearly rainfall. Small vertebrates were sampled with pitfall and Elliott traps. Responses of individual species were compared among three grazed and three less-grazed sites. One agamid species (Ctenophorus gibba) was captured more frequently at grazed sites, and two skink species (Ctenotus olympicus and Menetia greyii) at less-grazed sites. Mus musculus (an exotic mammal) was caught most frequently at grazed sites. No native mammal species responded to grazing intensity. Low-moderate livestock grazing in this study system, during periods of high rainfall, did not have a negative effect on most species studied. Complementary studies should compare responses during drought.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine lethal and sublethal effects of nitrite on the freshwater prawn, Palaemonetes argentinus (Nobili 1901). The 24, 48, 72 and 96 h median lethal concentration (LC50) of nitrite were found to be 103.07; 91.94; 82.39 and 62.53 mg L-1, respectively. The antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was positively correlated with the concentration of nitrite in the environment, thus increasing the formation of hydrogen peroxide, substrate of catalase (CAT), which also showed an increased activity under the same experimental conditions. Histological samples showed that nitrite exposure caused hyperplasia, necrosis and changes in the lamellar epithelium in gills; while the effects in the hepatopancreas were degenerative desquamation, epithelial deterioration and hyperplasia. In conclusion, nitrite toxicity in P. argentinus increases with time of exposure. Moreover, this study proves that histological analysis of crustacean gills and/or hepatopancreas is a useful tool to determine the presence of toxic concentrations of nitrite in the water. Additionally, the measurement of the activity of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD and CAT) as possible indicators of nitrite pollution should be considered in future studies.

AB  - The present study investigated the dissipation behaviors of 4 typical personal care products (PCPs)triclocarban (TCC), triclosan (TCS), tonalide (AHTN), and galaxolide (HHCB) in soils amended with biosolids under field conditions in North China. The results showed that the 4 target compounds were detected in all biosolids-amended soils at levels of a few nanograms per gram to thousands of nanograms per gram (dry wt). The residual concentrations of the 4 PCPs were found in the following order: TCC>TCS>AHTN>HHCB. Significant dissipation of the 4 PCPs was observed in the biosolids-amended soils, with half-lives ranging from 26 d to 133 d. Furthermore, repeated biosolids applications and a higher biosolids application rate could lead to higher accumulation of the 4 PCPs in the agricultural soils. Based on the detected concentrations in the field trial and limited ecotoxicity data, high risks to soil organisms are expected for TCC, whereas low to medium risks are expected in most cases for AHTN, HHCB, and TCS.

TI  - The Niger Delta's vulnerability to river floods due to sea level rise
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - An evaluation of vulnerability to sea level rise is undertaken for the Niger Delta based on 17 physical, social and human influence indicators of exposure, susceptibility and resilience. The assessment used geographic information systems (GIS) techniques to evaluate and analyse the indicators and the index of coastal vulnerability to floods, if sea level rise conditions are occurring. Each indicator value is based on data extracted from various sources, including remote sensing, measured historical data series and a literature search. Further on, indicators are ranked on a scale from 1 to 5 representing "very low" to "very high" vulnerability, based on their values. These ranks are used to determine a similar rank for the defined coastal vulnerability index (CVSLRI). Results indicate that 42.6% of the Niger Delta is highly vulnerable to sea level rise, such areas being characterised by low slopes, low topography, high mean wave heights, and unconfined aquifers. Moreover, the analysis of social and human influences on the environment indicate high vulnerability to sea level rise due to its ranking for type of aquifer, aquifer hydraulic conductivity, population growth, sediment supply and groundwater consumption. Such results may help decision makers during planning to take proper adaptive measures for reducing the Niger Delta's vulnerability, as well as increasing the resilience to potential future floods.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most important intercellular signaling molecules, and plays important roles in various biological systems. In this work, a unique Ru-II complex, tris[(5-(4-methylamino-3-aminobenzylamino)-1,10-phenanthroline)] ruthenium(II) hexafluorophosphate [Ru(MAA-phen)(3)][PF6](2), has been designed and synthesized as a luminescent probe for the detection of NO in aqueous media. The complex itself is almost non-luminescent, but can specifically react with NO under the aerobic conditions to afford its highly luminescent triazole derivative in aqueous media, [Ru(MTA-phen)(3)](2+) (MTA-phen: methyl-trazolebenzylamino-1,10-phenanthroline), accompanied by a 302-fold increase in luminescence intensity at 598 nm with a 130 nm Stokes shift. The luminescence response of [Ru(MAA-phen)(3)](2+) to NO is rapid, highly specific without interferences of other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, and highly stable against the pH changes in the range of pH 4.5-9.5. These features enable [Ru(MAA-phen)(3)](2+) to be used as a probe for the highly selective and sensitive luminescence detection of NO in weakly acidic, neutral, and weakly basic media.

AB  - Research has shown that time access restrictions in city centers might increase social sustainability aspects such as livability or safety, but might also increase the number of vehicles and the total distance travelled; which have negative environmental impact and can decrease economic sustainability. In this paper we see that this negative effect could also be the result of other access restrictions, like load factor restrictions, and may be related to factors other than the number of vehicles and total distance travelled. Such as if the distribution center is in the outskirts of the City and customers are situated outside the city center. In this study a common urban distribution network scenario is presented - the milk run - where only the load factor is changed. Increasing the load factor is usually regarded as a way of improving efficiency, but we observe that under certain conditions improving the load factor affects economic and environmental sustainability, by increasing total costs and emissions. Following insights from this study, policy makers and companies should be careful when using single key performance indicators in urban freight distribution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current research was carried out to find the most effective environmental factors in plant species distribution. For this purpose, a study was conducted in the Taleghan rangelands of Tehran province. Based on a vegetation map and field surveys, indicator vegetation types were identified. Within each type, 3 parallel transects with 150 m length, each containing 15 quadrates (according to vegetation variations) were established. The sampling method was randomized systematic. Quadrat size was determined for each vegetation type using the minimal area method. The floristic list and canopy cover percentage were determined in each quadrat. The topographic conditions (elevation from sea, aspect, and slope) were recorded in quadrat locations. Soil samples were taken from 0-30 cm in starting and ending points of each transect. Measured soil properties included depth, texture, organic matter, lime, pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, and potassium. To determine the most environmentally effective factors on plant distribution, multivariate techniques, including the principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) methods were applied. The results indicated that edaphically factors such as texture, potassium, and organic matter play a main role in the distribution of plant species.

AB  - The natural minerals pyrite and chalcopyrite have been used as the indicator electrode sensors using acetonitrile and propionitrile as solvents. The results show the exceptional advantage of pyrite and chalcopyrite as electrochemical sensors and also the possibility of the application of these electrodes for the determination in nonaqueous solutions where glass electrode shows many defaults. The behaviour of the pyrite and chalcopyrite indicator electrodes in nitriles were checked by titrating several bases and acids of different strengths using protons and lyate ions generated by the oxidation of some gallic acid esters and dihydroxy phenols, as well as m-cresol and 3-metoxy phenol. The results obtained by using these electrodes were compared with those obtained by the application of a glass electrode under the same conditions, and good agreement, reproducibility and accuracy were obtained. The standard deviation of the determination of the investigated acids and bases was less than 0.9%. In the potentiometric titrations with pyrite and chalcopyrite indicator electrodes, the potential is instantaneously established throughout. Both electrodes can be used without any time limit or without considerable divergence in potentials.

AB  - Kaplan, David S., and Pathania, Vikram-What influences firms' perceptions?
   Perceptions-based indicators are sometimes used to measure the quality of the business environment. For instance, firms are asked about the major constraints on business operations and expansion. Little is known, however, about what shapes their responses. In this paper, using perceptions-based indicators from 38 countries (84 country-year pairs) from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, we argue that firm responses are critically influenced by macroeconomic conditions. Paradoxically, we find that perceptions worsen during periods of high GDP growth. We also examine other indicators from the Enterprise Surveys that are objective measures of constraints, and find mixed evidence on how business constraints vary with the business cycle. Finally, we find that firms that introduce new product lines, which are likely those with the most interactions with regulatory agencies, have particularly bad perceptions of the business environment. We conclude that changes in firms' perceptions over time may not reflect changes in the business environment. Journal of Comparative Economics 38 (4) (2010) 419-431.

AB  - An enzyme-based biosensor was developed by co-immobilization of purified enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.5) and a fluorescence pH indicator on the tip of an optical fiber. Haloalkane dehalogenase catalyzes hydrolytic dehalogenation of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, which is accompanied by a pH change influencing the fluorescence of the indicator. The pH sensitivity of several fluorescent dyes was evaluated. The selected indicator 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was conjugated with bovine serum albumin and its reaction was tested under different immobilization conditions. The biosensor was prepared by cross-linking of the conjugate in tandem with haloalkane dehalogenase using glutaraldehyde vapor. The biosensor, stored for 24 h in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) prior to measurement, was used after 15 min of equilibration, the halogenated compound was added, and the response was monitored for 30 min. Calibration of the biosensor with 1,2-dibromoethane and 3-chloro-2-(chloromethyl)-1-propene showed an excellent linear dependence, with detection limits of 0.133 and 0.014 mM, respectively. This biosensor provides a new tool for continuous in situ monitoring of halogenated environmental pollutants.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment of normalised flood losses in Europe for the period 1970-2006. Normalisation provides an estimate of the losses that would occur if the floods from the past take place under current societal conditions. Economic losses from floods are the result of both societal and climatological factors. Failing to adjust for time-variant socio-economic factors produces loss amounts that are not directly comparable over time, but rather show an ever-growing trend for purely socio-economic reasons. This study has used available information on flood losses from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the Natural Hazards Assessment Network (NATHAN).
   Following the conceptual approach of previous studies, we normalised flood losses by considering the effects of changes in population, wealth, and inflation at the country level. Furthermore, we removed inter-country price differences by adjusting the losses for purchasing power parities (PPP). We assessed normalised flood losses in 31 European countries. These include the member states of the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, Croatia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
   Results show no detectable sign of human-induced climate change in normalised flood losses in Europe. The observed increase in the original flood losses is mostly driven by societal factors.

AB  - The potential of a Bacillus cereus isolate (NRRL 100132) as a biological agent for aquaculture has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The functionality of this isolate across a range of physiological conditions, including salinity, pH and temperature, based on rearing of high-value ornamental Cyprinus carpio, was investigated. Temperature had a significant influence on germination, specific growth rate and increase in cell number of B. cereus in shake-flask cultures, whilst salinity and pH did not have a measurable effect on growth. Controlled studies in bioreactors and modelling of the data to the Arrhenius function indicated the existence of high and low growth temperature domains. The rates of pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila suppression and decrease in waste ion concentrations (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and phosphate) were translated into a linear predictive indicator of efficacy of the B. cereus isolate at different temperatures. The present study confirmed the robustness of the B. cereus isolate (NRRL 100132) as a putative biological agent for aquaculture and further demonstrated a novel method for the assessment of in vitro biological efficacy as a function of temperature.

AB  - Vegetation is sensitive to climate changes; fossil pollen records are thus used as evidence for floral pattern changes linked with climatic shifts. Such an approach applied to West European/Mediterranean Pliocene-Pleistocene series has generated a paradigm in which abundant pollen of Artemisia (a principal constituent of steppe landscapes) is correlated with glacial episodes. Our study of an uppermost Pliocene series on Zakynthos island (Ionian sea, Eastern Mediterranean) mveals a behaviour opposite to the model mentioned above, in which Artemisia peaks are coeval with interglacial phases. This unusual occurrence of Artemisia with respect to glacial/interglacial cycles led us to consider the differences in species behaviour within the recent Artemisia genus (fossil Artemisia pollen has generally not been identified to the species level up to now). Our review of ecological conditions of some Maghrebian Artemisia species shows extremely large ranges of temperature and humidity. Palaeoclimatic interpretations based on Artemisia s.l. abundances thus require vigilance. The new evidence of Artemisia pollen peak in the Zakynthos Pliocene series has therefore major implications for our understanding of the complexity of palaeoclimatic patterns.

AB  - Mobilisation of contaminants is an important issue in environmental risk assessment of dredging projects. This study has aimed at identifying the effects of dredging on mobilisation of trace metals (Zn, Cu. Cd and Ph). The intensities and time scales of trace metal mobilisation were investigated during an experimental dredging project conducted under field conditions. The loss of contaminated dredge spoil is mainly reflected by increasing levels of trace metals in the suspended matter: dissolved trace metal concentrations in the water column are not significantly influenced bq the dredging activities, This indicates a strong binding mechanism of trace metals to the solid phase or a fast redistribution over sorptive phases in response to oxidation of e.g. trace metal sulphides. Given the differences in levels of reactive phases (Mn, Fe, sulphides and organic matter) between the riverine suspended matter and the sediments, changes in the levels of these parameters in the suspended matter upon dredging may give information on the processes influencing the behaviour of trace metals and on the potential loss of sediment during dredging operations. Therefore, we recommend to routinely measure these parameters in studies on contaminant behaviour related to dredging activities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ostracodes and agglutinated foraminifera characterize lagoonal, estuarine, marsh, and nonmarine depositional systems that span the land/sea transition. Using microfossil and sedimentary data, high-resolution paleoenvironmental change is documented in an Early Carboniferous marginal marine depositional system that was previously interpreted as nonmarine. There are five main paleoenvironmental phases: (1) low-energy bay dominated by the euryhaline marine ostracode Copelandella novascotica associated with glauconitic shale and primary framboidal pyrite; (2) restricted nearshore dominated by opportunistic paraparchitacean ostracodes (Shemonaella scotoburdigalensis, Shemonaella tatei, and Chamishaella sp.), Cavellina sp, and post-mortem Carbonita scalpellus associated with hummocky cross-stratified siltstone and shale; (3) coastal pond dominated by C. scalpellus and Carbonita rankiniana associated with pedoturbated calcareous mudstones; (4) distal lagoon dominated by paraparchitaceans, Bairdia sp, Geisina sp, and Youngiella sp, all associated with silty glauconitic shale; and 5) coastal marsh dominated by the agglutinated foraminifera Trochammina sp. associated with calcareous mudstones and in situ lycopsid trees. Low diversity, high dominance, and large populations characterize the microfossil assemblages that resemble modern ecosystems where physical and chemical conditions are unstable. The Horton Bluff Formation records the brackish-freshwater transition at the landward terminus of an Early Carboniferous marine transgression in the Maritimes Basin.

AB  - The relationship between allozyme genotype and survival of nymphs of the mayfly Isonychia bicolor (Walker) when exposed to acute mercury concentrations was tested in laboratory experiments. The probability of survival and individual times-to-death were found to be significantly different among genotypes at the glucose phosphate isomerase locus, but not at the phosphoglucomutase locus. This pattern was consistent for both summer and winter temperatures and for populations from 2 separate, unpolluted streams. Subsequent field surveys were conducted to determine if results of these acute laboratory tests could be extrapolated to the more chronic, sublethal conditions present in the South River, Virginia. Genotypes identified as sensitive and tolerant in the laboratory experiments showed no consistent relationship with environmental mercury levels in the South River. In fact, one heterozygote identified as tolerant was found to be more frequent at the reference site than at contaminated sites, and no significant between-site differences were observed in the frequencies of the most sensitive genotype. Consequently, despite fitness differences to mercury exposure among allozyme variants, we were unable to attribute any between-site differences in genetic structure in I. bicolor populations to adaptation to mercury pollution.

AB  - Laboratory studies have shown that Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) shrink if maintained in conditions of low food availability. Recent studies have also demonstrated that E. superba individuals may be shrinking in the field during winter. If krill shrink during the winter, conclusions reached by length-frequency analysis may be unreliable because smaller animals may not necessarily be younger animals. In this study, the correlation between the body-length and the crystalline cone number of the compound eye was examined. Samples collected in the late summer show an apparent linear relationship between crystalline cone number and body-length. From a laboratory population, it appears that when krill shrink the crystalline cone number remains relatively unchanged. If crystalline cone number is little affected by shrinking, then the crystalline cone number may be a more reliable indicator of age than body-length alone. The ratio of crystalline cone number to body-length offers a method for detecting the effect of shrinking in natural populations of krill. On the basis of the crystalline cone number count, it appears from a field collection in early spring that E. superba do shrink during winter.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the relative inactivation of MS2 coliphage (American Type Culture Collection strain 15597-B1) and heterotrophic plate count bacteria using raw surface water under a variety of naturally occurring conditions. It was found that the applied ozone dose and dissolved organic carbon had the most impact on ozone disinfection of MS2 coliphage and HPC bacteria. The dissolved organic carbon was found to compete for the ozone and significantly reduce the inactivation of both the coliphage and the bacteria. Furthermore, it was observed that the presence of any ozone residual inactivated greater than 4 logs MS2 coliphage and 2 logs heterotrophic plate count bacteria within a 30 second contact time. Ozone residuals greater than 0.20 mg/L inactivated greater than 5 logs MS2 coliphage and 3 logs heterotrophic plate count bacteria also within 30 second contact time. Comparison of inactivation studies indicate that MS2 coliphage is probably more sensitive to ozone than enteric viruses. It was concluded that the regulatory agencies should reevaluate their recommendations for using MS2 coliphage as an ozone disinfection indicator of enteric viruses.

AB  - Simple Summary Improving animal welfare, animal health and environmental issues is important in modern animal farming. In fattening of male turkeys, footpad dermatitis is a very frequent problem. Reducing faecal moisture is one way of controlling one source of footpad dermatitis. Therefore, in the present study, conducted under on-farm conditions, we added 0.2% enriched charcoal (known as a household remedy in therapy of diarrhoea and microbial imbalances) to the diet. Additionally, in a second experiment, the protein content of the diet was reduced by 1% from weeks 6-13 of life to slow down the growth rate and to reduce nitrogen in the litter. Three farms were visited four times during the fattening period to collect data on the birds. The charcoal-supplemented diet showed no effects on the performance of the birds or the examined health parameters. The protein-reduced and charcoal-supplemented diet did not influence the final bodyweight or the footpad status but reduced the mortality during the fattening period by 0.5%. In conclusion, enriched charcoal as 0.2% feed additive does not improve animal health, welfare or performance. Hence, a diet with temporarily reduced protein shows beneficial effects on the mortality rate and has no negative influence on the final body weight. Wet litter is the most important cause of footpad dermatitis in poultry, this in turn being a highly relevant animal-related welfare indicator. This field study was subdivided into two experiments. In Experiment 1, the standard diet was supplemented by 0.2% enriched charcoal, being a non-specific absorber and therefore might be promising in reducing faecal moisture. In Experiment 2, the experimental group received a reduced crude protein diet during weeks 6-13, combined with a 0.2% enriched charcoal supplementation. The trials were each conducted with two batches on three farms under on-farm conditions. The animals were observed at 6, 10, 14 and 18 weeks of age to collect data on body weight and different health parameters. The mortality and litter samples were analysed after slaughtering. In Experiment 1, performance and health were not affected despite higher dry matter content of the litter. In Experiment 2, the weight of birds receiving the protein-reduced diet was decreased significantly throughout the experiment. However, the slaughter weight did not differ. The mortality was reduced by 0.5% in the experimental group. Therefore, it was concluded that 0.2% of enriched charcoal is not a valuable feed-additive regarding animal health, while temporary protein reduction might have positive effects.

AB  - Upper Cretaceous mudstones are the most important source rocks in the Termit Basin, SE Niger. For this study, 184 mudstone samples from the Santonian-Campanian Yogou Formation and the underlying Cenomanian-Coniacian Donga Formation from eight wells were analyzed on the basis of palaeontological, petrographical and geochemical data, the latter including the results of Rock-Eval, biomarker and stable isotope analyses. Samples from the upper member of the Yogou Formation contain marine algae and ostracods together with freshwater algae (Pediastrum) and arenaceous foraminifera, indicating a shallow-marine to paralic depositional environment with fresh- to brackish waters. Terrestrial pollen and spores are common and of high diversity, suggesting proximity to land. Samples from the lower member contain marine algae and ostracods and arenaceous foraminifera but without freshwater algae, indicating shallow-marine and brackish-water settings with less freshwater influence. The wide range of gammacerane index values, gammacerane/C-30 hopane (0.07-0.5) and Pr/Ph ratios (0.63-4.68) in samples from the upper member of the Yogou Formation suggest a low to moderately saline environment with oxic to anoxic conditions. In samples from the lower member, the narrower range of the gammacerane index (0.23 approximate to 0.35) and Pr/Ph ratios (0.76-1.36) probably indicate a moderately saline environment with suboxic to relatively anoxic conditions. Petrographic analyses of the Yogou Formation samples show that organic matter is dominated by terrestrial higher plant material with vitrinite, inertinite and specific liptinites (sporinite, cutinite and resinite). Extracts are characterized by a dominance of C-29 steranes over C-27 and C-28 homologues. Results of pyrolysis and elemental analyses indicate that the organic matter is composed mainly of Type II kerogen grading to mixed Type II-III and Type III material with poor to excellent petroleum potential. Mudstones from the upper member of the Yogou Formation have higher petroleum generation potential than those from the lower member. Mudstones in the Donga Formation are dominated by Type III organic matter with poor to fair petroleum generation potential. Geochemical parameters indicate that in terms of thermal maturity the Yogou Formations has reached or surpassed the early phase of oil generation. Samples have T-max values and 20S/(20S+20R) C-29 sterane ratios greater than 435 degrees C and 0.35, respectively. 22S/(22S+22R) ratios of C-31 homohopanes range from 0.50 to 0.54. The results of this study will help to provide a better understanding of the hydrocarbon potential of Upper Cretaceous marine source rocks in the Termit Basin and also in coeval intracontinental rift basins such as the Tenere Basin (Niger), Bornu Basin (Nigeria) and Benue Trough (Nigeria).

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare growth performance, survival rate, physiological indicators and welfare of Atlantic salmon produced in a recirculation aquaculture system (RAS) or a flow-through (FT) system at identical temperature (13 degrees C), levels of dissolved oxygen (>85% saturation), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and water speed. In addition, the same parameters were followed up to four months after smolts seawater transfer. No significant difference in Atlantic salmon smolt growth performance was found during the production phase and up to four months after the transfer to sea cages. The cumulative mortality rate was within 1% prior to seawater transfer and at this point it was significantly higher for the RAS raised fish due to one week of increased mortality rate following vaccination. At the end of the experiment cumulative mortality was below 6% for both groups and did not differ between two groups. Although the growth performance has not reflected different production systems, several underlying differences on physiological and molecular level, as well as difference in welfare indicators were noted during the freshwater production phase. Atlantic salmon from the FT system showed a significantly higher mRNA expression of NKA alpha 1b at the seawater transfer compared to the RAS produced smolts. On the other hand, NKCC1, NKA alpha 1a, and CFTR1 were significantly down-regulated during the photo-manipulation period (day 64) in Atlantic salmon from RAS and NKA alpha 1a, and CFTR1 were significantly upregulated in the same group after three days in seawater compared to the FT-raised smolts. The RAS raised fish were better to regulate plasma chloride levels early after commencement of the full light regime. In addition, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and concentration of bicarbonate in the whole blood of smolts produced in the FT system were significantly higher than in RAS produced smolts prior to sea water transfer. Prevalence of fin damage and shorter operculum were significantly higher among smolts produced in the FT system at the seawater transfer. The significant difference in fin damage between the two groups of fish remained after four months in the sea.
   In total, 98% less water was used in RAS to produce Atlantic salmon smolt with similar performance and significantly lower prevalence of fin damage and operculum shortage versus more traditionally FT-system produced smolts, provided that the optimal conditions regarding stable temperature, tank conditions and water quality are met in FT-systems. This is the first experimental study that systematically compares the performance of Atlantic salmon smolt produced in environmentally controlled RAS and FT system during the freshwater phase and after transfer to sea cages.

AB  - In this study, seasonal and annual variability in the use of estuarine and ocean beaches by young-of-the-year bluefish, Pomatonlus saltatrix, was evaluated by indices of abundance in coastal areas of southern New Jersey (1998-2000). Biological and physical factors measured at specific sites were correlated with bluefish abundance to determine the mechanisms underlying habitat selection. In addition, integrative and discrete indicators of bluefish growth were used to examine spatio-temporal dynamics in habitat quality and its effect on habitat selection by multiple cohorts of bluefish. Intra-annual recruitment to coastal areas of southern New Jersey was episodic, and resulted from the ingress of spring-spawned bluefish (hatch-date similar to April) to estuarine beaches in late May to early June, followed by the recruitment of summer-spawned fish (hatch-date similar to early July) to ocean beaches from July to October. Bluefish utilized estuarine and ocean beaches in a facultative manner that was responsive to dynamics in prey composition and temperature conditions. The recruitment and residency of bluefish in the estuary (19981999) and ocean beaches (1998), for example, was coincidental with the presence of the Atlantic silverside Menidia nienidia and bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli, the principal prey species for bluefish occupying these respective habitat-types. Bluefish abundance in the estuary (2000) and ocean beaches (1999-2000) was also correlated with water temperature, with the greatest catches of juveniles coinciding with their optimal growth temperature (24 degrees C). Bluefish growth, estimated as the slope of age-length relationships and daily specific growth rates, equaled 1.27-2.63 mm fork length (FL) d- 1 and 3.8-8.7% body length increase d- 1, respectively. The growth of sagittal otoliths was also used as a proxy for changes in bluefish size during and shortly before their time of capture. Accordingly, otolith growth rates of summer-spawned bluefish were greater at ocean beaches relative to the estuary and were explained by the more suitable temperature conditions found at ocean beaches during the mid- to late summer. Notwithstanding the fast growth of oceanic summer-spawned bluefish, individuals spawned in the spring were still larger in absolute body size at the end of the summer growing season (similar to 240 and 50-200 mm FL for spring- and summer-spawned bluefish, respectively). The size discrepancy between spring- and summer-spawned bluefish at the onset of autumn migrations and during overwintering periods may account for the differential recruitment success of the respective cohorts.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine in steers the effect of two periods of fasting, either confined on the farm or transported by road, on their blood concentration of cortisol, glucose, beta-HBA, lactate and the blood values of leucocytes; PCV and plasmatic activity of CK. The study included two experiments, carried out during July 2001 (winter) and November 2002 (spring), in the province of Valdivia, Chile.
   One hundred and twenty steers from the same farm, breed, age (milk teeth or 2 permanent teeth) and live weight (average 450 kg) were used. In each experiment (winter - spring), 60 steers were bled by coccigeous venopunction, identified individually with ear tags and weighed. They were randomly allocated into four groups of 15 steers each: one group was transported by road for three hours without water or food, at the same time and under similar conditions, another group was kept confined in a pen at the farm. The other 2 groups were subjected to respectively similar conditions, but for a period of 16 hours. After treatments the steers were bled and weighed again.
   Plasma concentrations of cortisol were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA); the glucose concentrations by the GOD-PAP test without deprotenization (GL 2623, RANDOX(R)), lactate concentrations by the UV-enzimatic method; beta-HBA by using the enzymatic technique that uses the beta-hidroxibutirate deshidrogenase enzyme for measuring the pass from NAD+ to NADH; PCV and leucocytes values by using the SYSMEX KX - 4N haematological counter and the CK plasma activity was measured by the UV kinetic method. The stress indicators were checked for a normal distribution by visual inspection of a histogram of the variables with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When the distribution was not normal, the variables were normalised by taking a natural logarithm. Multivariable generalised linear regression models were used to determine the associations between the stress indicators and the independent variables. The independent variables were treatment (before transport or confinement, fasting in confinement for 3 hours, transported for 3 hours, fasting in confinement for 16 hours, and transported for 16 hours), and season (winter or spring).
   Steers that were transported for 3 h and those fasted in confinement for 16 h had significantly higher (P<0.01) cortisol concentrations than before treatment; the other treatments and season did not significantly (P=0.20) influence the concentration of cortisol. PCV values were significantly (P<0.01) decreased in steers confined for 3 h and significantly (P=0.02; P<0.01) increased in the steers transported for 3 and 16 h, respectively. The PCV values were also higher (P<0.01)in winter than in spring. Leukocyte values in steers did not show a consistent pattern but increased (P<0.01) in steers that were transported both for 3 and 16 h.

AB  - This study proposes a model and attempts to illustrate the relationship between the frequency of dynamic capability utilization and marketing capabilities, and how market, technology, and competitor turbulence may affect these relationships. The findings suggest that in a highly turbulent environment, frequent use of sensing and integration capabilities may cause certain changes in the impact of marketing capabilities, and in a highly competitive environment, marketing capabilities are positively correlated with company performance. The sample consists of 212 enterprises of China with a three-year vertical data span. The partial least square program Smart-PLS was used for data analysis. The careful management of dynamic capabilities (i.e., relational, sensory, and inclusive) is required to address environmental conditions to achieve capacity alignment and ultimately enhance performance. Our findings demonstrate that relationship capabilities are valuable to the organization and might even help improve its sensing and integrating capabilities. In a highly competitive environment, marketing capabilities contribute the most to company performance. The more frequent the environmental turbulence, the higher the impact of integration capabilities on marketing capabilities. This situation necessitates the organization's usage of dynamic capabilities to modify its marketing approach effectively between stable and turbulent environments.

AB  - Prolonged periods of extremely high temperatures with lack of precipitation mark heatwaves that pose health risks and damage ecosystems via rapid soil water depletion and reduced evaporative cooling. Identifying the conditions for the onset of heatwaves and their effects on land-atmosphere energy and mass fluxes remains a challenge. We propose using the generalized complementary relationship (CR) to estimate actual evaporation from heterogeneous landscapes overlain by different vegetation types (i.e., grasslands and forests) and quantify responses to radiation and air temperature anomalies. A strong correlation between air temperature and sensible heat flux anomalies deduced from FLUXNET data suggests that abrupt exceedances of sensible heat flux above climatological means are indicators for the onset of heatwaves. We capitalize on the coupling between latent and sensible heat fluxes and their links to soil moisture availability within the CR framework to predict anomalous increases in regional sensible heat flux associated with soil water depletion (low precipitation) and extreme evaporative demand (hot air and high radiation). The systematic and energy-constrained framework based on the CR concept provides insights into the triggering and feedbacks associated with heatwaves and hydro-climatic extremes such as regional droughts.

AB  - Dispersants with a low environmental impact are necessary for oil spill remediation. Thus, the biosurfactant produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas cepacia CCT6659 using industrial waste and formulated using a method of adding food preservative was evaluated for its toxicity against the vegetable Allium cepa and aquatic species such as the freshwater fish Poecilia vivipara and the bivalve Anomalocardia brasiliana. The biosurfactant was also applied in the removal of hydrophobic contaminant in sand and soils, in sea stones, in the dispersion and in the bioremediation of oil in seawater. The surfactant was considered to be of low toxicity for the bioindicators evaluated. As a petroderivative removal agent, the formulated tensoactive reached 76.55 % removal in soil and 84.50 % in sea stones. The biosurfactant was able to disperse 96.00 % of oil in seawater and promoted an increase in the biodegradation of oil by 70.00 % during a bioremediation process carried out in seawater.

AB  - There are currently no preventative options for recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and the only available treatments are palliative. This is partly due to a poor understanding of its etiopathogenesis. In this case-control study, we characterized the salivary proteome of patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis in the presence and absence of lesions. Through mass spectrometry-based proteomics and bioinformatics tools, we identified that the presence of oral ulcers is associated with several specific biological processes, including the metabolic pathways of vitamin B9, B12, nitrogen, selenium, and the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. These changes occurred only in the presence of clinically visible lesions, and there were no relevant differences between patients in anatomical regions unaffected by ulcers. Additionally, using western blot and ELISA assays, we verified that carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) and hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) proteins are highly expressed during the ulcerative and remission phases of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Our results cumulatively support saliva as an indicator of the pathophysiological changes, which occur during the clinical course of lesions. From a clinical perspective, we suggest that recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a condition triggered by temporary biological changes in people with lesions.

AB  - The Kerguelen Islands (49 degrees 26 ' S, 69 degrees 50 ' E) represent a unique environment due to their geographical isolation, which protects them from anthropogenic pollution. The ability of the endemic mussel, part of the Mytilus complex, to cope with moderate heat stress was explored using omic tools. Transcripts involved in six major metabolic functions were selected and the qRT-PCR data indicated mainly changes in aerobic and anaerobic energy metabolism and stress response. Proteomic comparisons revealed a typical stress response pattern with cytoskeleton modifications and elements suggesting increased energy metabolism. Results also suggest conservation of protein homeostasis by the long-lasting presence of HSP while a general decrease in transcription is observed. The overall findings are consistent with an adaptive response to moderate stresses in mussels in good physiological condition, i.e. living in a low-impact site, and with the literature concerning this model species. Therefore, local blue mussels could be advantageously integrated into biomonitoring strategies, especially in the context of Global Change.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the physiological and hematological parameters of sheep in Brazil. Therefore, 5,081 observations were used from previous experiments with animals from different Brazilian regions with the time of day, gender, breed, age, physiological characteristics, hematological and climatic variables. The animals were classified according to their stress level, and only data of non-stressed animals were used to calculate the reference values. Respiratory rate was the parameter that most differed from the normal range, with values above the limits usually reported for the species, being higher in commercial wool sheep. For hematological variables, differences were observed between the present results and the previously reported values in the literature. A higher number of red blood cells (RBC), lower hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were observed in young animals. A higher number of RBC and MCHC were noted in sheep crossed with local breeds. Considering that physiological and hematological parameters are indicators of the animal's pathological or physiological state, for a correct interpretation of the results, the use of reference values based on animals with similar racial characteristics and subjected to similar environmental conditions is recommended.

AB  - Renewable aviation fuel can be produced from all type of biomass, being those edible and non-edible the most studied. The technical feasibility of the production of renewable aviation fuel has been proved, but its price is still not competitive with that of its fossil counterpart. In order to reach this target, the use of waste feedstock to produce renewable aviation fuel is promissory; in particular, chicken fat stands out as a low-cost raw material with increasing availability. The conversion process for this raw material has not been economically evaluated, and neither it has been intensified. Therefore, in this work the modelling, simulation and intensification of the hydroprocessing of chicken fat to produce renewable aviation fuel is proposed. For this, conventional hydro treating processes are modelled and used to define the intensified ones, where complex configurations are used to perform the purification. All processes are compared in terms of economic and environmental indicators. Results show that the best scenario in terms of economic and environmental indicators is the process that include conditioning and reactive zones along with a direct intensified sequence; in this scenario there is the best tradeoff between the price of biojet fuel and the carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is known to reduce stereotypical behaviours in a wide range of captive animals, providing clear welfare benefits in many species. However, one of the most significant stressors faced by captive animals is live transport but whether enrichment can alleviate transport stress is unknown. Using behavioural measures as indicators of fish welfare, we investigated whether the addition of environmental enrichment can improve the welfare of ornamental fish during commercial transport. Pairs of bags containing variatus platy (Xiphophorus variatus) were transported by road with or without enrichment (plastic loops) from a UK wholesaler to one of two stores, the first and the last store on a delivery route. Transport time to the first store was short (< 4 h) and longer (> 6 h) to the second. Fish behaviour and incidences of mortality, disease and injury were recorded immediately following transport and during a four-week recovery period. Immediately post-transport, significantly fewer occurrences of erratic swimming were observed in the enriched group compared to the control group, and lower levels of chasing were recorded in the enriched group during recovery. This study is the first to demonstrate the behavioural benefits of enrichment during live transport of fishes under commercial conditions.

AB  - The Czech Republic is introducing new technological concepts for mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG) in coal-based energy industries. One such technology, in power plants, is post combustion CO2 capture from flue gases by activated carbon adsorption. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was used as the assessment tool to determine the environmental impacts of the chosen technology. This article focuses on a comparative LCA case study on the technology of temperature-swing adsorption of CO2 from power plant flue gases, designed for the conditions of the Czech Republic. The LCA study compares the following two alternatives: (1) a reference power unit and (2) a reference power unit with CO2 adsorption. The most significant changes are observed in the categories of climate change potential, terrestrial acidification, and particulate matter formation. The adsorption process shows rather low environmental impacts, however, the extended LCA approach shows an increase in energy demands for the process and fossil depletion as a result of coal-based national energy mix. The feasibility of the study is completed by the preliminary economical calculation of the payback period for a commercial carbon capture unit.

AB  - Know ledge of transport patterns of chemicals in groundwater is essential for environmental assessment of their potential impact. In the present study, the mobility of a chloride tracer injected into three different soils was investigated, using column experiments. The column tests were performed under steady-state conditions to determine parameters of chloride migration through soils. Based on breakthrough curves, pore-water velocity, dispersion coefficient and dispersivity constant were calculated for each soil sample using CXTFIT/STANMOD software. Pore-water velocity was in the range of 0.31 cm/min for fine sand, to 0.35 cm/min for silty sand and to 0.40 cm/min for vari-grained sand. The highest values of dispersion coefficient and dispersivity constant were observed for silty sand (0.55 cm(2)/min and 1.55 cm, respectively), while the lowest value was found for fine sand (0.059 cm(2)/min and 0.19 cm, respectively). Column experiments for chlorides (conservative tracer) are a preliminary stage for further research which will be undertaken to investigate migration parameters of selected neonicotinoids (reactive tracers) through different soils.

AB  - This study describes and evaluates improvements to the MARS crop yield forecasting system (MCYFS) for winter soft wheat (Triticum aestivum) in Europe, based on the WOFOST crop simulation model, by introducing autumn sowing dates, realistic soil moisture initialization, adding vernalization requirements and photoperiodicity, and phenology calibration. Dataset of phenological observations complemented with regional cropping calendars across Europe is used. The calibration of thermal requirements for anthesis and maturity is done by pooling all available observations within European agro-environmental zones and minimizing an objective function that combines the differences between observed and simulated anthesis, maturity and harvest dates. Calibrated phenology results in substantial improvement in simulated dates of anthesis with respect to the original MCYFS simulations. The combined improvements to the system result in a physically more plausible spatial distribution of crop model indicators across Europe. Crop yield indicators point to better agreement with recorded national winter wheat yields with respect to the original MCYFS simulations, most pronounced in central, eastern and southern Europe. However, model skill remains low in large parts of western Europe, which may possibly be attributed to the impacts of wet conditions.

AB  - Global environmental assessment (GEA) processes routinely deal with a wide range of divergent viewpoints. The entanglement of disputed facts and values within these viewpoints raises challenges for their legitimate treatment, particularly in solution-oriented GEAs. We offer a conceptualization of 'divergent viewpoints' in GEA processes covering both scientific and the political (normative) dimensions, focusing on actors' framing of environmental policy problems or on the suitability of particular response options. Based on extensive empirical research on three selected GEAs and a literature review, we distil nine general approaches which have been employed to respond to divergent viewpoints, and present these in terms of simplified, ideal-type strategies. We furthermore generate hypotheses about the advantages and drawbacks of each approach as well as conditions for success. Our analysis suggests that for policy-relevant divergent viewpoints highly disputed both on normative and scientific grounds, collaboratively exploring the practical implications of policy alternatives through GEAs is a particularly promising approach, although practical challenges remain. More broadly, this article contributes to a better understanding and more explicit discussion of existing, often implicit approaches within GEA processes for responding to divergent viewpoints. This article is part of a special issue on solution-oriented GEAs.

AB  - It is critical to extend and broaden the eco-industrial chain (EIC) by introducing new projects so that the stability of EIC network can be enhanced. At present, there is lack of effective control for project selection to eco-industrial park (EIPs) in China. This has led to low compatibility level of enterprises with the overall EIC network. By introducing the admission composite index, a framework is proposed in this study to assist the project selection in EIPs. It consists of three layers, i.e. target, criterion and variable. The preliminary index database is synthesized and simplified with Fuzzy Clustering Analysis (FCA). Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) was employed to determine the weighting of each indicator. On the basis of the evaluation criteria, the evaluation method of the index system under two different conditions were established. This enriches the theory and methodology of ecological industry development in China. Meanwhile, the index system is effectively verified via an empirical case study. Results show that the index system is feasible, and quantitative results are consistent with the practice. These findings provide a good practical reference for the decision making of project selection in EIPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A comparative chromatographic evaluation of chlorinated decarboxylated betanins and betanidins generated under activity of hypochlorous acid exerted upon these highly antioxidative potent decarboxylated pigments derived from natural sources was performed by LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS. Comparison of the chromatographic profiles of the chlorinated pigments revealed two different directions of retention changes in relation to the corresponding substrates. Chlorination of all betacyanins that are decarboxylated at carbon C-17 results in an increase of their retention times. In contrast, all other pigments (the non-decarboxylated betacyanins as well as 2-decarboxy- and 15-decarboxy-derivatives) exhibit lower retention after chlorination. During further chromatographic experiments based upon chemical transformation of the related pigments (decarboxylation and deglucosylation), the compounds' structures were confirmed. The elaborated method for determination of chlorinated pigments enabled analysis of a chlorinated red beet root extract that was submitted to the MPO/H2O2/Cl- system acting under inflammation-like conditions (pH 5). This indicates a promising possibility for measurement of these chlorinated pigments as indicators of specific inflammatory states wherein betacyanins and decarboxylated betacyanins act as hypochlorite scavengers.

AB  - Pecan [Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch] tree stem water potential (psi), shoot length, nut yield, and nut quality for the following treatments were evaluated in a commercial pecan orchard in Berrien County, GA; 1) current recommended irrigation schedule, 2) a reduced early season irrigation schedule, and 3) non-irrigated control. Water Stress on pecan occurred at approximate to -0.78 MPa using the pressure chamber to measure stem water potential. Regression analysis suggests that irrigation scheduling for mature pecan trees may be needed when volumetric water content reaches 10% on Tifton loamy sand soil. Water stress in pecan is correlated with soil moisture from budbreak through the end of nut sizing. Pecan trees bearing a moderate to heavy crop load may undergo water stress during the kernel-filling stage regardless of soil moisture level. Therefore, it is suggested that water stress during the kernel-filling period is a function of nut development, crop load, or both in addition to soil moisture. The reduced early season irrigation schedule provided a 38% reduction in irrigation water use with no significant effect on pecan tree water stress, yield, or quality, suggesting that pecan trees can tolerate moderate early season water stress with no effect on pecan yield or quality under southeastern U.S. environmental conditions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to clarify the taxon surrogacy hypothesis relative to vascular plants and bryophytes. A literature review was conducted to obtain papers that met the following criteria: (i) they examined species richness values; or (ii) they evaluated the species richness within the same study sites, or under the same spatial variation conditions. Twenty-seven papers were accessed. The richness of the two taxa, compared in 32 cases, positively co-varied in about half of the comparisons. The response to the spatial variation in environmental or human-induced factors of the two taxa in terms of species richness was rather variable. Based on current knowledge, the main documented findings regard forest habitats and nival gradients. In forest habitats, co-variation in species richness is likely when similar environments are analysed and seems to be strengthened for boreal forests. Along the nival gradient, a different response in terms of richness of the two taxa suggests that vascular plants cannot be considered good surrogates for bryophytes. (C) 2014 Academie des sciences.

AB  - Low temperature/natural drying of grain depends strongly on the climate. Being a slow process, experimental determinations are costly and difficult, so that developing a mathematical model and finding a proper method of solution is of great importance. The dryer model is composed of a first-order, hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) system, encompassing four dependent variables: grain moisture content, grain temperature, air temperature and air humidity, plus two independent variables: time and position along the bed depth direction. The bed system requires initial and boundary conditions, the latter of the Dirichlet type. In this work the following numerical methods for solving the set of dryer equations were compared: (1) explicit finite differences (2) implicit finite differences and (3) the method of lines. The performance parameters selected for the comparison were (a) drying time and (b) specific energy consumption. The influence of time and length steps of numerical solutions on such parameters was also assessed through indicators such as relative computing (CPU) time, prediction stability and truncation error.
   The results indicated that the method of lines was the most adequate to solve the compromise between these indicators. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate whether a preferential stimulation of microorganisms in anaerobically digested biosolids can occur after dewatering and if it can lead to pathogen indicator regrowth and odor generation upon storage. Laboratory incubation simulating biosolids storage indicates that both odorant generation, based on total volatile organic sulfur compound concentrations (TVOSCs) and pathogen indicator regrowth, based on fecal coliform densities follow similar formation and reduction patterns. The formation and reduction patterns of both odor compounds and fecal coliforms imply that groups of microorganism are induced if shearing disturbance is imposed during dewatering, but a secondary stabilization can be achieved soon after 1-2 weeks of storage. The occurrence of the induction is likely the microbial response to substrate release and environmental changes, such as oxygen, resulting from centrifuge shearing. The new conditions favor the growth of fecal coliforms and odor producing bacteria, and therefore, results in the observed fecal coliforms regrowth and odor accumulation during subsequent storage. However, when both substrate and oxygen deplete, a secondary stabilization can be achieved, and both odor and fecal coliforms density will drop. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for real-time/reliable/low-maintenance distributed monitoring systems, e. g., wireless sensor networks, has been becoming more and more evident in many applications in the environmental, agro-alimentary, medical, and industrial fields. The growing interest in technologies related to sensors is an important indicator of these new needs. The design and the realization of complex and/or distributed monitoring systems is often difficult due to the multitude of different electronic interfaces presented by the sensors available on the market. To address these issues the authors propose the concept of a Universal Intelligent Sensor Interface (UISI), a new low-cost system based on a single commercial chip able to convert a generic transducer into an intelligent sensor with multiple standardized interfaces. The device presented offers a flexible analog and/or digital front-end, able to interface different transducer typologies (such as conditioned, unconditioned, resistive, current output, capacitive and digital transducers). The device also provides enhanced processing and storage capabilities, as well as a configurable multi-standard output interface (including plug-and-play interface based on IEEE 1451.3). In this work the general concept of UISI and the design of reconfigurable hardware are presented, together with experimental test results validating the proposed device.

AB  - IJsselmeer was formed in 1932 through the closure of the Afsluitdijk that separated the artificial lake from the former Zuiderzee estuary. The palaeoecology of IJsselmeer was studied on a 63-cm-long sediment core. Lithology and microfossil data, particularly the diatom flora, clearly show the transition from the marine Zuiderzee into the freshwater IJsselmeer. Trophic conditions in IJsselmeer since 1932 have been inferred by qualitative and quantitative diatom-based approaches: by plotting the distribution of trophic categories based on published trophic indicator values, by a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) yielding relative total phosphorus (TP) changes and by applying a transfer function in order to calculate TP concentrations. All three approaches indicate that IJsselmeer initially was meso- to eutrophic. A first hypertrophic period is indicated for the mid-1940s, likely due to internal loading. After 1960, the phosphorus load steadily increased and TP in IJsselmeer reached highest concentrations (ca. 150 mu g l(-1)) in the 1980s as confirmed by monitoring data since 1975. The monitored data show that the TP concentration continuously decreased after 1985 due to successful environmental protection measures. This trend is not (or not yet) evidenced by the diatom data and thus, the diatom-inferred TP concentration.

AB  - Ants are often considered as good indicators of change of management in different habitats. They have been used sporadically to evaluate large scale transformations involving reafforestation. In the present study, the ant assemblages at 15 forest sites are compared. The sites differ in history, age and forest management. Our results show that there are clear changes in ant assemblages with developmental stage but even after 25 years not all forest species are present. Natural succession and planting of trees with or without any other management, resulted in only open country species, and some from forest and wet grassland colonizing these new forests. Sometimes gynes of target forest species arrived in new forests from nearby mature forest, but apparently were unable to start a colony. We attribute this findings to the lack of appropriate vegetation structure and litter characteristics, which determines the forest ant fauna, more than the dispersal of ant gynes. Further investigations should enable us to predict if these conditions can be produced by 50-100 or more years of forest succession and adequate management.

AB  - The possible effect of fishing on dominance patterns in the South African south coast demersal trawl fishery is assessed using Abundance Biomass Comparison (ABC) curves for the period 1986-2003. The ABC method compares the ranked distribution of abundance among species against the similar distribution of biomass among species. The temporal pattern in the ABC curves and the W-statistic for two depth groups (< 100m and 101-200 m), and for the whole area combined, shows a gradient of change in the demersal assemblages from neutral (W >= 0) towards negative (W < 0), suggesting a disturbed or stressed condition. This corresponds to the onset of longline fishing effort in 1994, still ongoing in 2003, superimposed upon declining trawl effort in the same region. The ABC method shows promise as a guide for assessing the effects of fishing on fish communities, being based on established r- and k-selection theory. More modelling and comparative work is needed to establish acceptable ranges for the W-statistic, and their application in an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

AB  - Transit traffic through the Austrian Alps is of major concern in government policy. Pollutant burdens resulting from such traffic are discussed widely in Austrian politics and have already led to measures to restrict traffic on transit routes. In the course of an environmental assessment study, comprehensive measurements were performed. These included air quality observations using passive samplers, a differential optical absorption spectroscopy system, a mobile and a fixed air quality monitoring station, and meteorological observations. As was evident from several previous studies, dispersion modeling in such areas of complex terrain and, moreover, with frequent calm wind conditions, is difficult to handle. Further, in the case presented here, different pollutant sources had to be treated simultaneously (e.g., road networks, exhaust chimneys from road tunnels, and road tunnel portals). No appropriate system for modeling all these factors has so far appeared in the literature. A prognostic wind field model coupled with a Lagrangian dispersion model. is thus presented here and is designed to treat all these factors. A comparison of the modeling system with results from passive samplers and from a fixed air quality monitoring station proved the ability of the model to provide reasonable figures for concentration distributions along the A10.

AB  - Thirty lakes in England and Wales were characterised by the distribution and abundance of chironomid species, collected as pupal exuviae, in correlation with chemical and physical measurements. Alkalinity and lake volume were the best predictors of chironomid species assemblage among lakes. Conductivity, lake volume and altitude were the best variables discriminating lake classes based on species distribution. A biological classification, constrained by conductivity, was used to calculate indicator species scores. A conductivity gradient of indicator species assemblages was produced to demonstrate how temporal or spatial reference conditions could be inferred. Conductivity, lake area and catchment area were the best predictors of profundal species distribution. Potential lake anoxia increased in explanatory importance after exclusion of littoral species. Alkalinity, catchment area and lake area significantly explained distribution of genera. Compared with a classification derived from 208 littoral and profundal species, discriminant analysis of best subsets of indicator taxa found 97 % of lakes were correctly classified using 15 profundal species and 73 % were correct using 7 genera. It was concluded that the pupal exuvial technique was an easy and effective method for characterising large lakes, as required for implementation of the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Hydrocarbon and fatty acid components of sediments from two large remote lakes in northern Canada, Lake Athabasca and Great Slave Lake, are compared with those from two large lakes in the heavily populated Great Lakes Basin, Lakes Ontario and Erie. Studies concentrated on modern sediments dating back 70-150 years, the period during which anthropogenic effects due to development would be expected for these basins. Normal alkane and fatty acid biogeochemical markers are useful for tracking the impacts of land-use changes to the sediments of these lakes. Carbon preference indices indicate the predominance of natural sources, and point to events and trends related to petroleum contamination in all four lakes, especially the Great Lakes. Normal alkane and fatty acid biogeochemical markers yielded different assessments of the relative amounts of aquatic sources of organic matter, suggesting that diagenetic processes alter the aquatic fatty acid profiles and affects their reliability as source indicators. The ratio of unsaturated to saturated n-C-16 acids appears to be diagnostic of depositional conditions that affect early diagenesis of fatty acids. Application of the biogeochemical marker approach to these lakes highlighted the differences in the degree of development in their watersheds.

AB  - For adequate quantification of soil quality, specific indicators need to be measured spatially. The choice of indicators, however, depends on the use to which the quality assessment is to be put. The Multiple-Variable Indicator Kriging (MVIK) method provides a novel means of integrating these factors into a single index. The quality of virgin farmland for maize (Zea mays L.) farming was evaluated on a 250 m x 250 m plot. Soil samples were collected from 100-cm-deep auger holes dug on 30 m x 30 m grids in the field. Soil pH, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Al++, organic C, and soil depth to plinthite were used as indicators for the assessment. The MVIK method was used to integrate these factors into a single index. Based on the variogram of the index, additional points were interpolated by kriging and a suitability probability contour map produced. Areas of low probability for meeting the criteria required for maize farming are indicated on the map. Soil conditions responsible for the failure to meet the criteria were identified, and ameliorative measures suggested. The usefulness of this technique for land evaluation for soil management and for environmental purposes was also discussed.

AB  - In The Netherlands Ranunculus hederaceus is a rare species that occurs in running waters. It appears to be confined to zones with a constant supply of mineral-poor groundwater, originating from highly fertilized fields.
   The relation between species performance and chemical composition of the water was investigated by means of response analysis. No relation was found unless the mineral content of the water was multiplied with stream velocity (yielding a measure for mineral supply per time unit). In the latter case significant correlations were found for calcium, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride and sulphate.
   We discuss whether low P-availability in the system could limit biomass production of Ranunculus hederaceus, although this appeared to be unlikely, Competition for light with algae and large helophytes is more likely to be a major reason for the absence of the species in stagnant waters.
   The situation near Oudemolen illustrates the indicative value of the species. Detailed investigations showed that artificial drainage changed the original mesotrophic conditions into eutrophic circumstances, which are much more favourable for this species. Hence, the increase of a rare plant species like Ranunculus hederaceus does not always indicate the well-being of a nature reserve.

AB  - This article proposes a model of journalistic creativity based on 21 in-depth interviews conducted with seasoned front-line journalists and award winners from the field, together with 405 journalism students and student journalists. The said model frames "journalistic creativity", which is hinged on the concepts of media professionalism from the traditional perspectives of journalism literature and political ideology albeit least studied in the academia - especially in journalism studies. As exemplified by the interviews and surveys conducted for this study, respondents seem to believe that creativity has now been taking a more prominent role especially in the manner of news presentation. Ostensively, they agree that creativity could only take place when the environment (accounting for media professionalism and political stance) allows. This study spotted the way media professionalism and political ideology serve as boundaries for journalists; however, there is always space for journalistic creativity especially when the conforming environment meets the conditions of consistent media professionalism and consistent political ideology. In addition, this study also presents how journalistic creativity plays out in day-to-day journalism so as to present the best of journalistic work.

AB  - In 'Justice and Nature', Thomas Nagel claims that social institutions are not responsible for inequalities caused primarily by nature, as opposed to socially caused inequalities. I evaluate this claim. To do so, I distinguish causal responsibility from substantive responsibility. I argue that Nagel rightly identifies conditions in virtue of which social institutions are not substantively responsible for an inequality, but the causal responsibility of nature is irrelevant for that assessment. The natural/social distinction is, I hold, misleading, and I offer two pragmatic reasons to stop using it. Besides, past criticisms to the natural/social distinction have questioned whether identifying the causal responsability of nature for an inequality is descriptively meaningful, epistemically possible, and morally relevant. My reconstruction of Nagel's view avoids these criticisms, I explain, by depriving the causal responsibility of nature of any role to identify an inequality as naturally caused. Moreover, I show that my reconstruction of Nagel's view, purged of the natural/social distinction, helps to justify the asymmetrical treatment of class-based inequalities and inequalities among people with different native endowments in the Rawlsian principle of fair equality of opportunity.

AB  - Tilio cordata Mill. is considered to be the main tree species resistant to urban conditions and it is widely used in the greening of cities. The aim of the study is to assess the patterns of growth and development of small-leaved linden plantations in the urban environment. The research is based on the method of sample areas where continuous enumeration survey has been carried out. The study of urban greening objects was conducted using the methods of landscape assessment and complete enumeration of trees in alley plantings. It was found that Tilia cordoto Mill. grows in all districts and zones of the city of Ufa, occupying 34.4% of green areas. During this research it was found that artificially created alley plantings of Tilia cordate, Mill. are more well-kept and have well-developed crowns which create a tree shade sometimes 8-10 meters wide (the average crown projection being 7 m). Since alley plantings have repeatedly been pruned, trees in this area are characterized by a large increase in diameter and strong height growth stagnation. Thus, when studying linden plantings of the same age, a sharp difference in the size and shape of trees was observed.

AB  - Sustainable development considers the development that achieves the present economic goals, without obstructing the future development in a sense of satisfying the needs of society and endangering the environment. Recently, the entrepreneurship phenomenon has been widely recognized as an important path towards sustainable development, positively contributing to the development of society. Thus, in the paper, the empirical evidence on linkages between entrepreneurial activity indicators and social development goals is provided. To examine the linkages, the data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and Sustainable Development Goals Index were used. The empirical results suggest that entrepreneurship represents an important factor for fostering sustainability, particularly in opportunity-driven and innovative entrepreneurial activities. The results show, that both of them have a positive impact on sustainable development, while the necessity-driven entrepreneurial activity negatively affects sustainable development. This could be explained by the fact that necessity entrepreneurs are not likely to become the entrepreneurs to implement a promising business opportunity, but rather to earn an income. To achieve the sustainable development goals as well as entrepreneurship should become the national priority by introducing new policies and measures, that is, making the conditions, through which entrepreneurship could achieve positive contributions to the development of the society.

AB  - Modern technology has enabled us to capture the ills of pollution including its growth at an alarming level. In the early part of 2020 the global shutdown due to Covid-19 caused the environment to `Reset' itself by cleaning it's rivers, oceans and skies. Clean energy helps to maintain a clean environment. We are introducing an ecofriendly solar bicycle which will support a pollution free environment. In addition, it will also support the good health of the rider as bicycle riding will engage a lot more balance and coordination than riding a car. It is pocket friendly and convenient way to travel short distance. Assembly consist of BLDC motor, Solar panel, Boost converter, Lead Acid Battery, Motor controller, throttle which works as an accelerator and a battery indicator. The solar panel is used to charge the lead acid battery through boost converter, which drives the BLDC motor connected to Pedal pass. While cycling if pedal is used, motor consumes less power and so the distance travelled will be doubled. To enhance the visual experience of user, Battery indicator is provided to monitor the battery status. The Motor controller acts as a brain of the bicycle. It orchestrates every component in the bicycle. During Cloudy Weather conditions USB charger can be utilized as an alternative to charge the battery.

AB  - Annual rhythms in humans have been described for a limited number of behavioral and physiological parameters. The aim of this study was to investigate time-of-year variations in late arrivals, sick leaves, dismissals from class (attendance), and grades (performance). Data were collected in Dutch high school students across 4 academic years (indicators of attendance in about 1700 students; grades in about 200 students). Absenteeism showed a seasonal variation, with a peak in winter, which was more strongly associated with photoperiod (number of hours of daylight) compared with other factors assessed (e.g., weather conditions). Grades also varied with time of year, albeit differently across the 4 years. The observed time-of-year variation in the number of sick leaves was in accordance with the literature on the seasonality of infectious diseases (e.g., influenza usually breaks out in winter). The winter peak in late arrivals was unexpected and requires more research. Our findings could be relevant for a seasonal adaptation of school schedules and working environments (e.g., later school and work hours in winter, especially at higher latitudes where seasonal differences in photoperiod are more pronounced).

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the bacterial communities in rearing water treated with commercial plastic biological ball filters named as Bio-ball in marron culture for 60days. Inclusion of Bio-ball in the aquaculture tanks showed improvement in water quality parameters and enrichment of bacterial communities in terms of operational taxonomic units. The water treated with Bio-ball showed significantly less nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphorus and high dissolved oxygen concentration than untreated control group. At phylum level, Proteobacteria was dominant in both control and treated water, whereas Firmicutes was found to be significantly (P<005) enriched in Bio-ball treated water. Among the classified genus, Aquabacterium and Polunucleobacter were most dominant in control and Bio-ball treated water respectively. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size exhibited 31 indicator bacterial genus, 10 in control and 21 in treated condition, suggesting the enrichment of microbial lineages with addition of Bio-ball. The bacteria Haliscomenobacter, Hypnocyclicus, Pajaroellobacter and Vibrio were found to be significantly (P<0001) correlated with higher pH, nitrate, nitrite, phosphorus and ammonia in control tanks, whereas Corynebacterium was linked to higher temperature in treated water. Overall results suggest that Bio-ball filter media significantly improved the water quality and microbial populations in aquaculture tanks.

AB  - Semi-stabilized dune systems are important indicators of Quaternary drought variability across central North America. The South Texas sand sheet (STSS) is the southernmost relict dune system on the Great Plains, and is exposed to higher evapotranspiration and moisture variability than similar landscapes farther north. In this study, a combination of surface and sub-surface remote sensing is used to analyze the semi-stabilized dune landscapes of the STSS in order to delineate distinct aeolian sediments that can represent generations of sedimentation or particular climate conditions. The combination of multi-resolution analysis of a LiDAR dataset, electromagnetic conductivity surveys, and XRF scans of soil cores are shown to be useful tools for deconstructing and modeling the environmental history of the STSS. Optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of identified surfaces suggests that the STSS is older than previously thought. Since dune systems are excellent repositories of climate and biophysical data for a landscape, and are also sensitive to changes in climate and ecology, the methodology employed in this study can be used to characterize the vulnerability of other similar environments to climate change through the Holocene and over the next century.

AB  - In recent years, the public discussion on welfare measurement 'beyond GDP' has considerably gained momentum in Germany. Among other developments, a growing political interest in the National Welfare Index (NWI) and its regional adaptation (Regional Welfare Index, RWI) points to the possibility of change. The NWI was created in 2009 with support from the Federal Ministry of Environment to improve sustainability and welfare accounting in Germany at the federal level, by developing a methodology based on the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). In response to a demand by political actors, it was adapted for the state level in 2011. Results both on the national and the regional level show striking divergences between NWI/RWI and GDP, but also between different German states. Challenges remain with regard to data availability, methodology and political adoption. However, there is growing recognition of the NWI/RWI as a serious alternative and support for the improvement of the data necessary for its calculation. Drawing on our experience, we discuss some theses on conditions that may favour or impede the adoption of alternative welfare measures.

AB  - The hydromorphological state and habitat quality of the selected streams in the Negev Desert was taken under consideration in the paper. Field studies were conducted in September 2014 on selected 500 m sections of streams (Nahal Be'er Sheva, Nahal Hebron) characterized by noticeable anthropopressure as well as on streams (Nahal Sansana, Nahal Yatir, Nahal Hatira) without visible human pressure. The survey of the hydromorphological state of selected streams was carried out using a British method, the River Habitat Survey (RHS). The hydromorphological state and habitat quality of the tested streams, based on the habitat naturalness indicator (HQA), as well as the habitat modification indicator (HMS), places the analysed streams of weak anthropopressure in class III-moderate (Nahal Yatir, Nahal Hatira) and IV-poor (Nahal Sansana). Bad hydromorphological state (class V) is the characteristic of the Nahal Hebron and Nahal Be'er Sheva streams with significant human pressure. However, it is important to verify RHS method and the classification of a hydromorphological state, especially the HQA index, and adapt them to the reference conditions in arid and semi-arid areas.

AB  - Soil passage through sand dunes has previously been shown to remove enteric micro-organisms very effectively, and hence is used for the production of drinking water. However, enterococci have occasionally been isolated from abstracted water (after dune passage) in one of the dune infiltration areas in the Netherlands. Enterococcus moraviensis was the most frequently isolated species. Until now, no faecal sources of this species have been reported and the potential for growth under certain environmental conditions was reported for other Enterococcus species. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of E. moraviensis to grow in habitats present in the dune passage process (dune vegetation, sediment from abstraction wells, biofilm developed using abstracted water and soil). Different concentrations of boiled and filtered (0.45 mu m) plant extracts obtained from dune vegetation supported growth (up to 6 log), with maximum concentrations after 4 to 6 days at 15 degrees C. Although E. moraviensis was shown to be able to attach to the biofilm, no growth was observed in biofilm or in sediment and soil. These observations confound the use of E. moraviensis as a faecal indicator.

AB  - Granite-derived soils are widespread in the farmland of Korea in general. In contrast, Jeju Island has mainly volcanic ash soils. Soils and weather condition in Jeju Island created a unique agricultural system. We identified the features of ground-dwelling insects in farmlands of Jeju Island. This study was conducted in four areas (Samdal-ri and Susan-ri in Seogwipo city, and Dongmyeong-ri and Suwon-ri in Jeju city) in Jeju Island, Korea. Field surveys were carried out twice in summer (June) and autumn (September) in 2013. Ground-dwelling insects were sampled quantitatively by using pitfall traps. As a result, in total 3322 individuals, 137 species, 48 families and 8 orders were investigated in farmlands of Jeju Island. Especially, members of Coleoptera and Hymenoptera accounted for a large proportion of ground-dwelling insect communities. The numbers of species and individuals for major taxonomic groups showed significant regional and seasonal differences. This study implied that the seasonal and regional differences of ground-dwelling insect communities were affected by surrounding land use patterns, life history patterns of each taxonomic group and farmland management.

AB  - Desalination becomes in many parts of the world and also in Europe a promising option to combat water stress in water scarce regions. However, also the question of sustainability and environmental impacts of this technology is in focus of numerous studies and discussions. Especially, the focus is set on high energy demand and disposal of generated brine. In this study, the conventional desalination technology in Europe reverse osmosis (RO) has been compared to the newly developed membrane based technology Memstill (R) by means of life cycle assessment (LCA). The objective is to define clearly conditions when the environmental impacts are lowest. The results reveal not only the strong dependency of the energy supply and demand but also the potential to reduce the environmental impacts while combining with alternative renewable energy supply. The reverse osmosis can be combined with renewable energies and Memstill (R) with cogeneration or waste heat. The global warming potential can even be reduced by 98% when RO is combined with wind energy instead of using the electricity grid mix of Spain. Memstill (R) is especially favourable to RO for feed water with higher salt content due to its almost salt concentration independent energy demand. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil vapour intrusion is now commonly evaluated as part of human health risk assessments at contaminated sites where buildings or other structures are located in close proximity to volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in subsurface soils and groundwater. Investigation of the vapour intrusion pathway often requires that VOC concentrations in the soil gas adjacent to buildings and structures be characterized as part of the risk assessment process. This paper presents the design of a new soil gas monitoring well and a sampling procedure that effectively eliminate concerns about soil gas sample dilution due to short-circuiting of atmospheric air and help to ensure the collection of representative soil gas samples. The results of a parametric numerical modelling study that was applied to address the air short-circuiting issue and the technical rationale for the new soil gas monitoring well (SGMW) design are presented in this paper along with recommended soil gas sampling procedures in various soil conditions. The SGMW design rationale and methodology outlined in this paper considered the effects of soil moisture content and permeability, the depth to the sampling screen interval, and the soil gas sample extraction rate.

AB  - Microbial quality of reclaimed water can be adequately interpreted by graphical adjustment of experimental results to a lognormal probability distribution; the method serves to verify the degree of conformity to the proposed distribution and to visualize the time variability of the results. A conventional physico-chemical treatment can inactivate up to 1.0 mu log of common bacterial indicators, while maintaining time variability below 1.0 (mu log/100 ml). Dissolved organic matter in the influent will significantly alter the performance and the reliability of disinfection process, highlighting the need for improved adjustments of disinfectant dose to actual quality of treated water. Although those process may reach inactivation rates as high as 6.0 mu log for common bacterial indicators, their reliability may be considerably affected, forcing standard deviations beyond 3.0 (mu log/100 ml). Natural processes can provide inactivation rates from 3.0 to 3.5 for common microbial indicators, under the weather conditions studied. Although those values are lower than those of physical and chemical disinfectants, the reliability of natural processes is more stable, with standard deviations ranging from 0.65 to 1.1 (mu log/100 ml). Natural processes are particularly sensible to external inputs of microbial indicators, due to the presence of wildlife.

AB  - This trial was conducted to assess the suitability of one local and eight introduced lucerne (Medicago sativa) cultivars to seasonally dry conditions in the semi-arid region of west China. The foliage yield, root biomass, decline in plant density and proline accumulation in leaf were significantly different between the nine lucerne cultivars after two dry seasons. `Ameristand201' and `Algonquin' cultivars performed well based on foliage yield. Root biomass of `Ameristand201' and `Sandili' was significantly greater than that of the other seven cultivars. `Ameristand201' was the best cultivar in drought resistance, with higher proline accumulation in its plant leaves. `Sandili' and `Longdong' cultivars both had good persistence and a low decline in plant density with time. Adopting the Analytical Hierarchy Process, a new procedure for evaluating lucerne genotypes for semi-arid land was proposed by combining these indicators based on experts' and farmers' suggestions. The suitability of the nine cultivars decreased in the order: `Ameristand201', `Sandili', `Algonquin', `Amerigraze401', `Deft', 'Goldenempress', `Derby', `Sitel', and `Longdong'. This study indicated that `Ameristand201' and `Sandili' were the cultivars most suitable for sowing in the semi-arid regions of west China.

AB  - Forage yield and density are common selection criteria for assessing the suitability of lucerne varieties in high rainfall conditions and under irrigation. However, selection criteria for assessing the suitability of lucerne varieties is not well defined in dryland farming systems. This study combines forage yield, plant density, root biomass and proline content in the plant leaf to compare the suitability of 1 local and 8 introduced lucerne ( Medicago sativa) varieties over 3 years in the dry environment of west China. The results of this study indicated that the above measurements significantly differed among the 9 lucerne varieties, and also showed that suitability of lucerne varieties varied based on different indicators. Ameristand 201 and Algonquin performed well in terms of forage yield. Ameristand 201 and Sandili were well-adapted varieties based on root biomass and Ameristand 201 was the first selected variety in terms of drought resistance. Combining initial establishment density and its decline over years indicated that Sandili maintained good persistence. A cluster analysis of 9 lucerne varieties indicated that Ameristand 201 was very suitable for sowing in the dry Loess Plateau, a high water-erosion region in west China.

KW  - conservation
AB  - It has been suggested that minor, fluctuating differences in size of bilateral traits could validly indicate individual differences in developmental stability. One plausible reason for instability to occur could be lowered population size, which has been suggested to increase fluctuating asymmetry due to inbreeding, for example. We measured seven wing asymmetries of three Coenonympha butterfly species in central Sweden. One species is abundant (C. pamphilus), one rather common (C. arcania), and one rare (C. hero). We expected that if fluctuating asymmetry is a reliable indicator of population quality and thus a useful tool for conservation purposes, the most abundant species should show lowest asymmetry and the most endangered, the highest. Contrary to our expectations, the highest wing asymmetry was found in the relatively common species C. arcania and the most abundant and rare species did not show significant differences in levels of wing asymmetry. Our results obtained from three Coenonympha species hence suggest that the use of fluctuating asymmetry as an indicator of population conservation status may be misleading. Possible increase in asymmetry of small and/or isolated populations of butterflies may be masked by local differences in environmental conditions that could have high impact on bilateral development as well.

TI  - Assessing ecological sustainability of slash-and-burn agriculture through soil fertility indicators
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the near- and long-term impact of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture on soil fertility in the village of Kembera, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Soil fertility is widely viewed as one of the key limits to sustainable production in slash-and-burn agroecosystems. A chronosequence of sites ranging from currently cultivated swiddens to a 28-yr fallow was surveyed. Organic C, cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, nitrate, extractable basic cations, available and total P, and extractable Al were measured as indicators of soil fertility Inferred short-term trends point to significantly improved soil fertility conditions after burning in currently cropped swiddens relative to falloffs. During the fallow, soil organic C, CEC, nitrate, total P, and extractable basic cations all manifest positive associations with fallow length after 3 to 11 yr of fallow; No declines in soil parameters were detected between plots based on the frequency of past slash-and-burn activity Therefore, there is no evidence that slash-and-burn agriculture in Kembera has degraded these soil resources. While the results of this study suggest that slash-and-burn agriculture in Kembera has been ecologically sustainable, recent changes in socioeconomic factors influencing farmer's land-use decisions cast doubt upon the future sustainability of this agroecosystem.

AB  - In the course of two growing seasons (1992 and 1993) there was investigated the zonation of vegetation with reference to soil conditions at the saline grassland in the vicinity of Inowroclaw Soda Plants at Matwy town. In data analysis there were used: classification method - hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis and as well as two ordination techniques: Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). As a result of the classification analysis five vegetation zones were distinguished, related to the following communities: community with Festuca rubra, Potentillo-Festucetum arundinaceae, community with Euphorbia lucida and Phragmites australis, Triglochino-Glaucetum maritimae and Puccinellio distantis-Salicornietum brachystachyae. The ordination techniques used in the analysis have demonstrated that out of the measured soil properties the most essential part, in the formation of the grassland vegetation zonation, played the content of chloride ions (which was used here as the main salinity measure), while moisture and pH were of minor importance. All the measured environmental factors accounted for only a low percentage (26.5% in 1992 and 17.2% in 1993) of the total vegetation variation, what might suggest that besides chloride ions another factor might have affected the development of zonation.

AB  - Several studies have indicated that the early life stages of freshwater mussels are among the most sensitive aquatic organisms to inorganic chemicals, including copper. However, little is known about the toxic mode of action and sub-lethal effects of copper exposure in this group of imperiled animals. In this study, the physiological effects of long-term copper exposure (survival, growth, copper bioaccumulation, whole-body ion content, oxygen consumption, filtration rate, ATPase activities, and biomarkers of oxidative stress) were evaluated in juvenile (6 month old) mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea). The mussels' recovery capacity and their ability to withstand further acute copper challenge were also evaluated in secondary experiments following the 28 day exposure by assessing survival, copper bioaccumulation and whole-body ion content. Mussels chronically exposed to 2 and 12 mu g Cu/L showed significantly higher mortality than those held under control conditions (mortality 20.9, 69.9 and 12.5%, respectively), indicating that juvenile L. siliquoidea is underprotected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) biotic ligand model (BLM)-derived chronic water quality criteria (WQC) (2.18 mu g Cu/L) and the hardness-derived USEPA WQC (12.16 mu g Cu/L). Soft tissue copper burden increased equally for both copper exposures, suggesting that chronic toxicity is not associated with copper bioaccumulation. Several physiological disturbances were also observed during chronic copper exposure. Most relevant was a decrease in whole-body sodium content paralleled by an inhibition of Na+K+-ATPase activity, indicating a metal-induced ionoregulatory disturbance. Filtration and oxygen consumption rates were also affected. Redox parameters (reactive oxygen production, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, and glutathione (GSH) concentration) did not show clear responses, but membrane damage as lipid peroxidation (LPO) was observed in both copper exposures. Mussels previously held in control conditions or pre-exposed to 2 mu g dissolved Cu/L were able to maintain their ionic homeostasis and did not experience mortality after the 4-d recovery period. In contrast, those previously exposed to 12 mu g dissolved Cu/L exhibited 50% mortality indicating that they had already reached a 'point of no return'. Pre-exposure to copper did not influence mussel response to the copper challenge test. As observed for the chronic exposure, mortality of mussels held in the absence of copper and submitted to the challenge test was also associated with an ionoregulatory disturbance. These results indicate that ionoregulatory disruption in freshwater mussels chronically exposed to copper is the main mechanism of toxicity and that redox parameters do not appear to be useful as indicators of sub-lethal copper toxicity in these animals.

AB  - The baurusuchids were terrestrial notosuchian crocodyliforms from the Upper Cretaceous of South America. The present study analyzes a partial postcranial skeleton, MPMA 62.0002.02, collected in strata from the Adamantina Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtia, Bauru Basin) near the General Salgado municipality, Sa similar to o Paulo state, Brazil. The specimen was identified as a notosuchian, and more precisely to the family Baurusuchidae because of the presence of a dorsal protuberance on the postzygapophysis, robust ribs, a scapula with a dorsal convex border, and a strong middle constriction. The presence of bone tissues with different growth rates signifies that at least some baurusuchids present different allometric rates for the humerus, vertebrae, and osteoderms. The results also show that there may be a shift between fast and slow growth rates throughout life. Our results suggest a a possible correlation between the developmental delay of these animals and the seasonal environmental changes in semiarid conditions. The histological and morphological descriptions proved to be efficient for identifying the Baurusuchidae family, as well as for defining indicators to comprehend the biology of extinct species.

AB  - Social disadvantage is thought to correlate with and might indeed be compounded by insufficient transport infrastructure. Additionally, the prevalence of pedestrian mode choice for trips is shown to be affected by levels of social disadvantage and vulnerability. For elementary school-age children and their guardians, these relationships could complicate daily mode choice and travel with respect to getting to school. This research explores the spatial dependence of socioeconomic and pedestrian network service indicators through a comparative spatial analysis of pedestrian level of service (LOS; Landis et al. 2001) and social deprivation index (SDI; Butler et al. 2013) across suburban census tracts comprising the Putnam City School District in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Results indicate statistically significant clusters where substandard pedestrian LOS and challenging socioeconomic conditions colocate at specific census tracts in the study area, along with significant effects demonstrated under spatial lag regression modeling. Implications for planning and public health are discussed, inclusive of both social (public awareness initiatives, walking school buses) and physical (improvements to the pedestrian environment) intervention.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different salinity levels on tissue histology, blood biochemistry, and genes transcription of the GH/IGF system in juvenile golden trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Five experimental salinity levels (0, 8, 16, 24, and 32 parts per thousand) were selected to domesticate juvenile O. mykiss for 7 days. Histological characteristics changed with salinity, including higher ionocites area and epithelium thickness in gills, narrow lumen of collecting tubules in kidneys, and high numbers of goblet cells in the intestines. Similarly, increments in slits, degenerate hepatocytes, and individualization of hepatocytes have been shown in fish reared in the 32 parts per thousand salinity group. The lowest triglyceride (TG) and the highest level of total protein (TP) were detected in fish reared at the 32 parts per thousand group. The genes transcription of the GH/IGF system altered in response to the increase of salinity. The present results add to the understanding of the physiological responses of O. mykiss on salinity stress and would be helpful in formulating strategies to optimize the aquaculture of this species in environments with fluctuating patterns of salinity.

AB  - The term "sustainability" is flexible as it needs to function in many different contexts and across many issues. At the same time, this flexibility makes it difficult to assess and easy to misuse. Over the last three decades, numerous sustainability assessment tools have been developed to better define the term. In this paper, we critically address these attempts and argue that the flexibility of the term is not solely problematic, but allow people to create their own sustainability imaginaries, by which we mean a society's understanding of how environmental resources should be used. We show this through a case study, the Martin Brod village in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where, within a few years, the inhabitants changed their sustainability imaginaries in parallel with shifting external socio-economic conditions and expectations. We primarily applied qualitative research methods. Our results show that changing sustainability imaginaries was made possible due to the flexibility of the term which enabled otherwise disempowered local inhabitants to have agency. Consequently, a stricter definition of sustainability may have unintended consequences for people struggling to maintain a political voice in settings such as Bosnia and Herzegovina.

AB  - The success of ecosystem restoration following mining could be improved through consideration of the soil microbial community, which forms the foundation of ecosystems. Through sequencing we can assess the response of the microbial community to stresses such as stockpiling, and measure community recovery. We sequenced fungal and bacterial communities associated with intact Banksia woodland reference soils and stockpiled topsoil stored for one to ten years following sand mining in Western Australia. We found that both bacterial and fungal richness declined, but that the fungal community returned to a state similar to reference soils, whereas the bacterial community did not. Notably, Bradyrhizobium was absent from 10-year soils, indicating a possible lack of inoculum available to colonize legumes that are often used for revegetation. Soil fungi and bacteria respond differently to stockpiling and key taxa such as Bradyrhizobium could be lost. In addition, changes in the bacterial community may signal a reduction in plant-available nitrogen and a shift towards more anaerobic conditions consistent with previous studies. These changes in microbial communities support previous findings of reduced plant performance on 10-year stockpiled soils and emphasize the importance of considering soil age during restoration.

AB  - The article presents data from many years of research that confirms the fact that the system of teaching younger students based on the method of learning activity creates conditions for successful cognitive, social and personal development of children in primary school. Students aged 10-11 show a higher level of mastery of key competencies than their peers who study on the basis of traditional methods and techniques of organizing educational work. It is reliably established that the" developing educational environment" allows children to form higher results on such important indicators of learning ability as the ability to separate the known from the unknown and ask questions about the unknown. The indicators of development of the basics of theoretical thinking (content analysis, depth of planning, reflection) in children who study on the basis of the method of learning activity are higher than in children who study in a traditional school. The "developing educational environment", in contrast to traditional schools, contributes more to the effective development of children's social competencies - the ability to interact, overcome cognitive conflict, and exercise mutual control and evaluation of actions performed.

AB  - The Hindu-Kush Himalaya region extends over 4 million km(2) across the eight countries. Knowingly, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is considered the principal altitudinal permafrost constituent on earth and is deemed as the third 'pole'. Among which, the Zoige wetlands are located in the northeastern boundary of QTP, wrapping a total area of 6180 km(2) with an average altitude of 3500 m. This entire region is the hotspot for methane emission since the last decade. Given the importance of methane emission, many studies have focused on the effect of environmental fluctuations on the overall methane profile and, more recently on the methanogenic community structure. The current review summarizes recent advancements of the methanogenic community and methane profile and outlines a framework for better understanding of the microbial ecology of the Zoige wetlands, China. Moreover, as microorganisms are indispensable to biogeochemical cycles, especially for methane, they are believed to be the best indicators to identify the condition of wetlands. Hence, we suggest that, underpinning the microbial profile could help understand the status of a wetland. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The quality of water, under the influence of the wastewater treatment plant's discharges, makes the simulation of the water parameters a key issue, broadly when considering intermittent rivers. In the case of study, the Pracana reservoir works as an example of the characterization, monitoring and control of the impact of several wastewater treatment plants' discharges, directly contributing to water quality. Proenca-a-Nova's wastewater treatment plant contributes directly to the Pracana reservoir (Central Portugal), which is a protected field. Twelve georeferenced water samples were gathered, between the sewage discharge and downstream to the Pracana reservoir, at almost equal distances. Sampling campaigns were taken during three different periods: rainy winter (January), intermediate conditions (March) and dry season (June). The following chemical parameters were analyzed: biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), dissolved oxygen (DO), dry residue, P-total, N-total, pH, temperature and microbiological parameters. DO, BOD5 and microbiological parameters served as indicators for environmental pollution evaluation. A coupled hydrodynamic and water dispersion model, QUAL2kw, was used for water's quality simulation. The results lead to conclude that the water quality is acceptable for multiple purposes, except for human consumption, mainly due to moderate-to-high values of BOD5.

AB  - The article focuses on the environmental and economic assessment of animal/poultry manure utilisation technologies as the sources of the greatest negative impact on environment from agriculture. This procedure is especially topical in the context of current transition to BAT system in Russia. Russian BAT reference books on intensive rearing of pigs and intensive rearing of poultry came into force on June 1, 2018. At present, the large-scale livestock farms face the difficult task of selecting efficient technologies for manure utilisation with due account for their performance potential and the opportunities for end products use. To address the relevant practical issues, the criteria for the environmental and economic assessment of technologies were developed for selecting the rational technological solutions adjusted to the conditions of particular agricultural enterprises. Environmental assessment was based on the nitrogen saving coefficient. The developed approaches were applied to a dairy farm for 2600 head, a poultry factory for 1 million head and a full-cycle pig rearing complex for 16,500 head. The best suited technologies of animal/poultry manure utilisation were substantiated for these enterprises, which would allow achieving the reduction in environmental pollution by nutrients at the economically justified costs.

AB  - Epidural anesthesia is a pain relief treatment mainly used for pregnant women during delivery. The procedure is described as an injection of anesthetic fluid into an epidural space using a hemodynamic Tuohy needle. The correct identification of epidural space is crucial for successful anesthesia, but due to the blindness of the procedure, the existing methods can fail with potentially severe consequences for patients. Since the tissue preceding the epidural space has high density, the strain significantly changes when the needle reaches the proximity of the epidural space, and this change can be used as an indicator. Distributed fiber optic sensors, working with an optical backscatter reflectometer, can improve the scenario by measuring the strain along each section of the epidural needle. This work goes beyond the epidural space identification: distributed strain data detect strain events leading to a potential failure to reach the epidural space before the procedure is finalized. The experiments have shown that the penetrations along different paths (with different speeds, with misalignment, and with rotation) result in different strain patterns. The proposed method has been validated on phantoms reproducing the epidural space, in different insertion conditions.

AB  - The effects of climate change are likely to be dependent on local settings. Nonetheless, the compounded effects of global and regional stressors remain poorly understood. Here, we used CO2 vents to assess how the effects of ocean acidification on the seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, and the associated epiphytic community can be modified by enhanced nutrient loading. P. oceanica at ambient and low pH sites was exposed to three nutrient levels for 16 months. The response of P. oceanica to experimental conditions was assessed by combining analyses of gene expression, plant growth, photosynthetic pigments and epiphyte loading. At low pH, nutrient addition fostered plant growth and the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. Overexpression of nitrogen transporter genes following nutrient additions at low pH suggests enhanced nutrient uptake by the plant. In addition, enhanced nutrient levels reduced the expression of selected antioxidant genes in plants exposed to low pH and increased epiphyte cover at both ambient and low pH. Our results show that the effects of ocean acidification on P. oceanica depend upon local nutrient concentration. More generally, our findings suggest that taking into account local environmental settings will be crucial to advance our understanding of the effects of global stressors on marine systems.

AB  - Rarefaction Curves are frequently used in Environmental Impact Assessments to evaluate sampling sufficiency, but without clear guidelines of how to ensure that the assumptions of the methods are met. Infrastructure projects in the Brazilian Amazon and elsewhere often occupy extensive areas in remote locations with difficult access, and random sampling under such conditions is impractical. We tested the influence of sampling unit (sample or individual), and geographic distance between samples on rarefaction curve s, and evaluated the magnitude of errors resulting from the misuse of rarefaction curve in decision making, using frogs from four Amazonian sampling sites. Individual-based rarefaction curve were steeper than those generated by sample-based rarefaction curve. Geographic distance influenced the number of exclusive species in a predictable fashion only in one area, and not in the Environmental Impact Assessment site. Misuse of rarefaction curve generated large errors in the identification of vulnerable taxa. Because the rarefaction curve model is sensitive to the assumption of randomness and geographic distance can influence it unpredictably, we suggest that rarefaction curve should generally not be used to estimate sample completeness when making management decisions for environmental licensing purposes.

AB  - A series of experiments were carried out under controlled environments and field conditions (2002-2008) to evaluate populations of the potential oilseed crop Cuphea PSR23 for indicators of evolution under cultivation and to assess its level of domestication in comparison with its wild parents. Cuphea PSR23, a selection with reduced seed shattering, resulted from a cross between two wild species (C. viscosissima and C. lanceolata). Phenotypic traits, singly or in combinations, and nutrient ratios measured on plants and seed of all three species were subjected to a set of multivariate statistical analyses procedures to identify and assess indicators of phenotypic divergence of Cuphea PSR23 from its wild parents over several planting-harvesting-seed selection cycles. Results of this assessment suggested that Cuphea PSR23 is phenotypically distinct from its wild parents (with 84.9 % correct classification in canonical discrimination). Compared to its wild parents, Cuphea PSR23 displayed stronger relationships between plant- and seed-based traits with seed yield; exhibited enhanced multivariate relationships between yield components (expressed as principal components and path analysis coefficients); and had larger oil content stored in larger seeds. However, this phenotypic divergence did not fully separate Cuphea PSR23 from its wild parents as indicated by the level of multivariate trait integration, a few shared principal components, and incomplete discrimination.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a signalling molecule involved in many biological processes in bacteria, plants and mammals. However, little is known about the role and biosynthesis of NO in fungi. Here we show that NO production is increased at the early stages of the transition from vegetative growth to development in Aspergillus nidulans. Full NO production requires a functional nitrate reductase (NR) gene (niaD) that is upregulated upon induction of conidiation, even under N-repressing conditions in the presence of ammonium. At this stage, NO homeostasis is achieved by balancing biosynthesis (NR) and catabolism (flavohaemoglobins). niaD and flavohaemoglobin fhbA are transiently upregulated upon induction of conidiation, and both regulators AreA and NirA are necessary for this transcriptional response. The second flavohaemoglobin gene fhbB shows a different expression profile being moderately expressed during the early stages of the transition phase from vegetative growth to conidiation, but it is strongly induced 24 h later. NO levels influence the balance between conidiation and sexual reproduction because artificial strong elevation of NO levels reduced conidiation and induced the formation of cleistothecia. The nitrate-independent and nitrogen metabolite repression-insensitive transcriptional upregulation of niaD during conidiation suggests a novel role for NR in linking metabolism and development.

AB  - Cypripedium macranthos var. rebunense is a well-known endangered terrestrial orchid that is endemic to the cool-temperate Rebun Island off the coast of northwestern Hokkaido, Japan. The present study aimed to identify suitable methods for conservation of this orchid through management of the natural vegetation. We analyzed the vegetation types and plants growing sympatrically with this orchid using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination. Reproductive orchids can survive in various broad-leaved and short to medium-height herbaceous meadows with high plant species richness at a small scale in coastal regions. In order to maintain C. macranthos var. rebunense populations, succession to dense and tall large-leaved herbs, Sasa scrub, shrubs, and trees, should be suppressed. Favorable vegetation for the establishment of seedlings of this orchid includes narrow-leaved, medium-sized grasses, sedges, herbs, mosses, and prostrate mat-forming shrubs. The ground cover offered by these plants and their litter may favor stability of moisture, temperature, and suitable light conditions at the ground surface. In situ seed sowing at such 'safe sites' is a potential low-impact technique to enhance seedling recruitment of this orchid.

AB  - Sediments of core YSJD-86GC (referred to as 86GC) collected from the southern South China Sea were selected for environmental magnetic studies. Combined with the published chronological framework, sediment magnetic properties were revealed for the study area since the MIS3 stage. The rock magnetic results indicate that low-coercivity magnetite is the main magnetic mineral within the sediments. Also, a certain amounts of hematite are present. The King plot and Day plot, which reflect the magnetic particle size, show that fine-grained pseudo-single-domain phase magnetic particles dominate the magnetic minerals in the sediments. Comparison of magnetic parameters and geochemical indicators show that magnetic properties of core 86GC sediments reflect a terrigenous input. Simultaneously, magnetic characteristics of the studied sediment are influenced by the quantity of terrigenous sediment input, oxidation-reduction conditions of the provenance area, and the transportation environment and distance. Sea level fluctuation caused by global climate change was the main factor for variation in concentration of magnetic minerals and magnetic particle size of the studied core sediments. Thus, variation of sediment magnetic properties in the study area can be used as an indirect indicator of sea level fluctuation.

AB  - The assessment of age-at-death in non-adult skeletal remains is under constant review. However, in many past societies an individual's physical maturation may have been more important in social terms than their exact age, particularly during the period of adolescence. In a recent article (Shapland and Lewis: Am J Phys Anthropol 151 (2013) 302-310) highlighted a set of dental and skeletal indicators that may be useful in mapping the progress of the pubertal growth spurt. This article presents a further skeletal indicator of adolescent development commonly used by modern clinicians: cervical vertebrae maturation (CVM). This method is applied to a collection of 594 adolescents from the medieval cemetery of St. Mary Spital, London. Analysis reveals a potential delay in ages of attainment of the later CVM stages compared with modern adolescents, presumably reflecting negative environmental conditions for growth and development. The data gathered on CVM is compared to other skeletal indicators of pubertal maturity and long bone growth from this site to ascertain the usefulness of this method on archaeological collections.

AB  - Dynamic reduction of fault strength is a key process during earthquake rupture. Many mechanisms for causing coseismic weakening have been proposed based on theory and laboratory experiments, including silica gel lubrication. However, few have been observed in nature. Here we report on the first documented occurrence of a natural silica gel coating a fault surface. The Corona Heights fault slickenside in San Francisco, California, is covered by a shiny layer of translucent silica. Microstructures in this layer show flow banding, armored clasts, and extreme comminution compared to adjacent cataclasites. The layer is composed of similar to 100 nm to 1 mu m grains of quartz, hydrous crystalline silica, and amorphous silica, with 10-100 nm inclusions of Fe oxides and ellipsoidal silica colloids. Kinematic indicators and mixing with adjacent cataclasites suggest the shiny layer was fluid during fault slip. The layer therefore represents a relict silica gel that formed during fault motion, and which could have resulted in frictional instability. These observations confirm that the silica gels formed in rock friction experiments do occur in natural faults and therefore that silica gel formation can act as a dynamic weakening mechanism in faults at shallow crustal conditions.

AB  - Monitoring and interpretation of the changes to the vegetation of rangelands are key functions for ecological models and sustainable management. Field work was well organized to generally represent the rangelands in the province of Nevsehir, in Central Anatolia, Turkey, in the year 2008. A modified wheel-point method with a loop was used to detect the basal cover of species of vegetation. There were 185 species in 31 sample sites throughout Nevsehir Province. Ordination analysis was performed with the Integrated System for Plant Dynamics software package, which includes detrended correspondence analysis and sample-centered principal components analysis. A gradient analysis showed that 30 sample sites represented a relatively homogeneous area, and there were 50 plant species found as promising indicators. Only 8 plant indicator species (Poa pratensis, P. alpina, Chrysopogon gryllus, Festuca valesiaca, Bromus cappadocicus, Stipa holosericea, Cynodon dactylon, and Trachynia distachya) and bare ground demonstrated clear responses along the pastoral impact gradient. For this reason, changes in the abundance of these indicators occurred on 3 management units of this ordination gradient. It is recommended that these species be used to monitor and assess trends in vegetation change and range conditions in Central Anatolia.

AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the origin and to reconstruct the geological evolution of lignites from the Drmno field (Kostolac Basin, Serbia). For this purpose, petrological and organic geochemical analyses were used. Coal from the Drmno field is typical humic coal. Peat-forming vegetation dominated by decay of resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, followed by prokaryotic organisms and angiosperms. The coal forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Peatification was realised in a neutral to slightly acidic, fresh water environment. Considering that the organic matter of the Drmno lignites was deposited at the same time, in a relatively constant climate, it could be supposed that climate probably had only a small impact on peatification. Therefore, variations in compositions of macerals and biomarkers indicate changes in the water level, due to seasonal drying of the mire, which caused vegetation differences in the palaeoplant communities and changes in the redox conditions (from anoxic to slightly oxic) during peatification. Diagenetic transformations of the organic matter were mainly governed by microbial activity, rather than thermal alteration.

AB  - In addition to its mass concentration, the health effects of urban particulate matter may depend on its particle size distribution and chemical composition. Yet air pollution regulations rely on exclusively bulk PM10 concentration measurements, without regard to their potentially different health effects under different conditions. Aerosols from various sources are well known to contain a plethora of toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic constituents such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Extensive public health studies established the link between mass concentrations of PM2.5/PM10 and health problems within the population. However, little is known about the relative importance of PM from different sources and the effect of seasonality on the toxicity. Here we present the application of a simple and sensitive method for the direct assessment of the overall ecotoxicity of various PM2.5/PM10 samples collected on filters. The method is based on the Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition bioassay that has been standardized for solid samples, representing a relevant biological exposure route. Direct emission samples proved to be significantly more ecotoxic than photochemically processed aerosol, thus marked differences were observed between the ecotoxicities of urban PM10 in summer and winter. These effects of urban PM10 may be useful supplementary indicators besides the mass concentrations of PM2.5/PM10 in cities.

AB  - The commercially important marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean mussel) is considered a valuable bioindicator, due to its exposure to various pollutants and extreme environmental conditions. Environmental responsive genes, such as the hsp90s, protect the structure and function of cells and accomplish a significant task in cellular homeostasis. To study the hsp90s in M. galloprovincialis a genomic library was screened and two hsp90s were isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that the two genes exhibit great similarities in both the 51 non-coding and the coding region but differ in the 31 non-coding region, as well as in three introns, due to the presence of repeated sequences. Few synonymous substitutions in the coding region of the genes result to an identical predicted polypeptide, which belongs to the cytoplasmic HSP90 subfamily. The 5' non-coding region contains a non-translated exon and multiple binding sites for various transcription factors. The presence of a p53 binding site in the promoter of the isolated genes raises questions about the possible implication of hsp90s in the molluscan leukemia. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed a rapidly growing interest in the biological basis of human mate choice. Here we review recent studies that demonstrate preferences for traits which might reveal genetic quality to prospective mates, with potential but still largely unknown influence on offspring fitness. These include studies assessing visual, olfactory and auditory preferences for potential good-gene indicator traits, such as dominance or bilateral symmetry. Individual differences in these robust preferences mainly arise through within and between individual variation in condition and reproductive status. Another set of studies have revealed preferences for traits indicating complementary genes, focussing on discrimination of dissimilarity at genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). As in animal studies, we are only just beginning to understand how preferences for specific traits vary and inter-relate, how consideration of good and compatible genes can lead to substantial variability in individual mate choice decisions and how preferences expressed in one sensory modality may reflect those in another. Humans may be an ideal model species in which to explore these interesting complexities.

AB  - Soil characteristics in palaeosols are an important source of information on past climate and vegetation. Fingerprinting of soil organic matter (SOM) by pyrolysis-GC/MS is assessed as a proxy for palaeo-reconstruction in the complex of humic layers on top of the Rocourt pedosequence in the Veldwezelt-Hezerwater outcrop (Belgian loess belt). The fingerprints of the extractable SOM of different soil units are related to total organic carbon content, delta C-13 and grain-size analysis. Combined results indicate that the lower unit of the humic complex reflects a stable soil surface, allowing SOM build-up, intensive microbial activity and high decomposition. Higher in the profile, decomposition and microbial activity decrease. This is supported by a shift in the isotopic signal, an increased U ratio and evidence of wildfires. Although the chemical composition of the extracted SOM differed greatly from recent SOM, fingerprinting yielded detailed new information on SOM degree of decomposition and microbial contribution, allowing the reconstruction of palaeo-environmental conditions during pedogenesis.

AB  - Microbial reactions play an important role in regulating pore water chemistry as well as secondary mineral distribution in many subsurface systems and, therefore, may directly impact radionuclide migration in those systems. This paper presents a general modeling approach to couple microbial metabolism redox chemistry, and radionuclide transport in a subsurface environment. To account for the likely achievement of quasi-steady state biomass accumulations in subsurface environments, a modification to the traditional microbial growth kinetic equation is proposed. The conditions for using biogeochemical models with or without an explicit representation of biomass growth are clarified. Based on the general approach proposed in this paper, the couplings of uranium reactions with biogeochemical processes are incorporated into computer code BIORXNTRN Version 2.0. The code is then used to simulate a subsurface contaminant migration scenario, in which a water flow containing both uranium and a complexing organic ligand is recharged into an oxic carbonate aquifer. The model simulation shows that Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides may vary significantly along a flow path. The simulation also shows that uranium(VI) can be reduced and therefore immobilized in the anoxic zone created by microbial degradation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seabirds and marine fish share habitats and food webs, but there is too little contact between the disciplines that study them. Fish stock assessment models, designed for use on teleost fishes with high fecundity, high recruitment variability, and continued growth throughout life, may be strengthened by inclusion of seabird data. In some circumstances seabird-based indices of prey abundance could assist in calibration of sequential population analysis of fish stocks. Seabird energy acquisition rates, equivalent to fisheries catch per unit effort, are the most promising avian indicators of stock size. Seabird data may be useful in predicting recruitment of commercial fisheries and in improving estimates of natural fish mortality. The impact of seabird predation on fish stocks depends on the age of targeted fish and their subsequent growth and mortality. Yield-per-recruit analyses, derived from fisheries science, suggest that under plausible conditions the impact of seabird predation on fish stocks may be amplified by avian preference for small prey. Increased collaboration between seabird biology and fisheries science will benefit conservation of both birds and fish.

AB  - Women face discrimination in many aspects of social and economic life, especially in a patriarchal society. Disproportionate behaviour of society towards women exacerbates the challenges of disaster for them. Hence, in different hazard studies, women are inevitably considered to be the most vulnerable. Though women's vulnerability to hazard is realized and often highlighted, their capability to absorb, recover and adapt to a disaster situation remains unclear, unrecognized, and less appreciated in the existing socio-economic condition of Bangladesh. This research intends to identify the potential socio-economic indicators of household disaster resilience that are sensitive to gender differences. These indicators represent the possible sectors of gender discrimination that are unavoidable while building household resilience. The study was conducted in four villages located in the southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh, which continues to be impacted by hazards like floods, cyclones, thunderstorms, and salinity intrusion. Disaster resilience was assessed separately for men and women of the study areas considering the selected gender sensitive indicators. It is seen that women in these areas are still lagging behind men in terms of disaster resilience, but they are making notable progress in health, community engagement, education, and economy.

AB  - Evaluating driving factors of river ice freeze-up and break-up is critical for the understanding associated with river ice processes, as well as for providing a means to predict potential natural hazards of river ice formation or deformation. Spatiotemporal changes from fifteen years (2000-2015) of MODIS reflectance band 2 images were analyzed in pixel-wise linear regressions to be used as an indicator of the rates of ice freeze-up and break-up along the Slave River (Canada). The random forest algorithm was used to model the rates using river corridor slope, effective width, shape, and sinuosity as a set of predictor variables. The results reveal that the selected predictor variables can explain about 80% and 70% of the variations in ice freeze-up and break-up rates along the Slave River respectively. The slope was the most important factor in determining both freeze-up and break-up rates, followed by shape, effective width, and sinuosity. The spatiotemporal patterns of river freeze-up and ice-cover break-up obtained from the analysis of MODIS data and geomorphological variables show strong agreement with ground observations and hydrometeorological conditions along the Slave River.

AB  - This study explores the cycling usage and frequency determinants in college campuses located in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area. The study discerns the attitudes of individuals toward the proposed infrastructure and environmental improvements with the goal of promoting biking to campus. We develop a structural equation model (SEM) using the travel information of 780 individuals, which was collected between December 2014 and June 2015. The results indicate risk factors have a higher explanatory value on bike-to-campus frequency than campus infrastructure and program. We further examine how and to what extent mixed populations on college campuses respond to latent factors. The findings pinpoint that males are less concerned about the risk-related indicators such as theft and road and environment-related obstacles such as poor road conditions. However, females have a positive attitude toward campus-related improvements such as pro-bike programs. Overall, students show a negative attitude toward the road and environmentally-related obstacles compared to staff and faculty. Minority groups, specifically African American and Asian, show a positive attitude toward campus-related improvements, unlike white participants. The findings can assist planners and advocates in implementing effective policy measures to increase bike-to-campus frequency.

AB  - Simulation modelling tools have been widely adopted for the evaluation of alternatives in transport planning, management and logistics. The complexity that underlies in transport systems and logistics necessitate the integration of different models that are capable of overcoming limitations that may exist individually to each model. Towards this direction, this paper aims to integrate two simulation software and use the integrated model for the evaluation of traffic and logistics measures in the wider area of Volos Port, Greece. The built model is able to simulate the traffic conditions on a transport network along with port's intra-logistics processes and is used to evaluate a set of measures in the year 2030, by comparing it with the situation in the year 2030 without having implemented any new measure. For the evaluation, a set of indicators is used to gauge the environmental and transport impacts. The analysis is completed by using a multi-criteria decision making tool to generate the Logistics Sustainability Index (LSI) to summarize the information that is provided by the indicators. The results show that the use of integrated simulation models can provide a holistic impact evaluation of complex decisions with a high level of accuracy.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate yield, grain quality characteristics, and cost-effectiveness of different crop protection methods in the cultivation of spring wheat using two levels of mineral fertilization of crops. The study shows that the combined application of the herbicide Lintur 70 WG (dicamba and triasulfuron) with ethephon or chlormequat chloride did not adversely affect spring wheat productivity. The highest yield was obtained in the treatment with intensive fertilization (5.18 t ha(-1)) and in the treatments with the application of herbicide in combination with ethephon (5.26 t ha(-1)). The chemical crop protection methods caused significant differences in grain test weight. In turn, mineral fertilization modified all the studied grain quality characteristics. An analysis of the indicators used to evaluate the economic effects of the spring wheat production technologies investigated showed a clear advantage of the lower intensity technology over the more intensive technologies, which should be associated with the high costs of mineral fertilization that were not compensated by the yields obtained. In analyzing the production and economic effects, treatment with the application of the herbicide in combination with ethephon under basic mineral fertilization conditions proved to be most beneficial.

AB  - The use of gene expression-based classifiers has resulted in a number of promising potential signatures of patient diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy. However, these approaches have also created difficulties in trying to use gene expression alone to predict a complex trait. A practical approach to this problem is to integrate existing biological knowledge with gene expression to build a composite predictor. We studied the problem of predicting radiation sensitivity within human cancer cell lines from gene expression. First, we present evidence for the need to integrate known biological conditions (tissue of origin, RAS, and p53 mutational status) into a gene expression prediction problem involving radiation sensitivity. Next, we demonstrate using linear regression, a technique for incorporating this knowledge. The resulting correlations between gene expression and radiation sensitivity improved through the use of this technique (best-fit adjusted R-2 increased from 0.3 to 0.84). Overfitting of data was examined through the use of simulation. The results reinforce the concept that radiation sensitivity is not driven solely by gene expression, but rather by a combination of distinct parameters. We show that accounting for biological heterogeneity significantly improves the ability of the model to identify genes that are associated with radiosensitivity.

AB  - Effects of three biocides, esfenvalerate, picoxystrobin and triclosan, were studied in a Soil-Multi-Species (SMS) test system with four springtail- and one earthworm species exposed for eight weeks. All biocides affected springtail population growth negatively, and species- and chemical specific differences had clear impacts on their dominance structure. We suggest that differences in vulnerability may be influenced by activity related to species-specific vertical distribution in the soil. The responses of the springtail Folsomia fimetaria differed strongly from previous results from a single-species experiment with the same biocides. Survival of juvenile earthworms was more sensitive to biocide exposure than weight gain, and earthworm performance was significantly correlated with springtail abundance. Feeding activity of soil organisms measured with the bait lamina test system was a sensitive criterion for esfenvalerate and picoxystrobin exposure, but not for triclosan. The results suggest that interspecific interactions such as resource- and interference competition may influence the toxicity of biocides. SMS test systems may hence be a suitable method for investigating direct and indirect effects in combination under standardized laboratory conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The distribution of free sterols in a sulfur-rich lacustrine sediment of Miocene age deposited in the ancient crater lake of the Nordlinger Ries (southern Germany) was investigated and compared with the corresponding distributions of esterified and kerogen-bound sterols. The three fractions exhibited the same suite of principal sterols, with 4 alpha,24-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol, dinosterol and dinostanol displaying the highest concentrations and relative abundances. The distributions of sterols, steroidal ketones, n-alkanols and isoprenoid alcohols suggest a prevalent deposition of autochthonous aquatic organic matter under saline conditions. In particular, the high abundance of 4 alpha,24-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholestan-3-one, dinosterone and dinostanone and the corresponding 4-methyl sterols indicates the importance of dinoflagellate productivity in this former crater lake and its significant contribution to the sedimentary lipids in the Nordlinger Ries sediment. The similarity in structures and relative abundance of the major 4-methyl sterols and the corresponding steroidal ketones suggest that they are biosynthetically linked.

AB  - We measured seasonal effects of wastewater treatment plant (WTP) effluent on growth, survival, and accumulation of microbes in oysters near a major WTP in Mobile Bay, AL. Despite higher nutrients near the WTP, seasonal conditions rather than distance affected chlorophyll a concentration and oyster growth. In summer and fall, when oyster growth was higher, delta N-15 parts per thousand in oysters near the WTP changed through time to reflect delta N-15 parts per thousand in effluent (approx. -4 parts per thousand). Microbial indicators (male-specific coliphage, fecal coliforms) were highest in oysters near the WTP in all seasons and correlated with delta N-15 parts per thousand in fall and summer. Increased riverine discharge and slower acquisition of delta N-15 parts per thousand likely confounded correlations in winter/spring. Although we did not detect gross ecological effects of wastewater exposure for oysters, data indicated wastewater-derived particles entered the local food web and accumulated in oysters. These data highlight the importance of using multiple indicators of wastewater exposure and considering both seasonal and spatial effects when defining wastewater influence on a system or species.

AB  - It is well known that protozoan grazing can be an important agent of mortality for suspended bacteria, both in marine and freshwater environments. Considering that the presence of fecal contamination is a frequent phenomenon in these environments, and that Escherichia coli and the genus Enterococcus are indicators of microbiological water quality, the effect of protozoan grazing on E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis in Los Padres Lagoon waters (Buenos Aires, Argentina, 37 degrees 56'30 '' S, 57 degrees 44'30 '' W) was herein analyzed. Microcosm assays were carried out, simulating lacustrine conditions, confronting suspensions of autochthonous bacterivorous protozoans with suspensions of autochthonous and collection strains of E. coli and E. faecalis, combined and individually. Daily counts were made for evaluating bacterial survival and the number of ciliates. The results obtained indicate that there is a preferential sequence for bacterial removal in the water, where E. faecalis is more grazing-resistant than E. coli. Moreover, it was noted that the origin of bacterial strains influenced their sensitivity for grazing, at least in the short term (e.g. the collection strains were less affected). We conclude that protozoan grazing can modify the relative abundance of fecal indicator microorganisms, thus altering the results of water quality studies.

AB  - The minute snail Pupilla alpicola (Stylommatophora: Pupillidae) is known as a threatened glacial relict restricted to treeless calcareous fens with Holocene continuity, mainly in the Alpine and Carpathian regions. We summarize all available data on the distribution of P. alpicola and analyse its ecological requirements in the Western Carpathians both at a larger, regional scale (162 sites) and at a smaller, within-site scale (10 sites). Viable populations of Pupilla alpicola occurred in 31 sites out of the 162 fens studied. Water conductivity, Ellenberg's indicator values for soil reaction, light and nutrients were the main ecological variables that explained these occurrences. The species preferred sites with extremely high calcium carbonate precipitation, low nutrients and sparse herb vegetation cover. Its present distribution in the Western Carpathians is strongly related to a spatial-temporal continuum of calcareous fens throughout the Holocene; none of the modern populations was located further than 40 km from the known palaeorefugium. Direct fossil evidence shows that these palaeore-fugial fens have persisted since the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. A conservation strategy for this rare species needs to take account of both historical continuity and the maintenance of appropriate ecological conditions.

AB  - Zooplankton communities are an important component of the pelagic food web, but they are absent from the list of biotic elements to be considered for the assessment of ecological status in Annex V of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). We report here on an assessment of zooplankton populations across 32 lakes that represent a gradient of alkalinity and anthropogenic impact, primarily owing to nutrients and/or acidity. Acidic and oligotrophic lakes were typified by a high relative abundance of cladocerans, but with some key taxa groups absent from the most acidified lakes. Zooplankton total abundance increased across the trophic gradient. This interplay between acidity and productivity provides the potential to assess effects of anthropogenic pressure on zooplankton communities. Incorporation of ecological function, as opposed to structure, can additionally be evaluated through community attributes, particularly fecundity and size distribution. The assessment of the zooplankton can be cost-effective and related to reference conditions. Reasons for this omission from the requirements of monitoring under the Water Framework Directive are unclear, but this should not preclude the use of zooplankton communities if they can provide a valuable component for ecological assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biosurfactant production was investigated using two strains of Bacillus subtilis, one being a reference strain (B. subtilis 1012) and the other a recombinant of this (B. subtilis W1012) made able to produce the green fluorescent protein (GFP).
   RESULTS: Batch cultivations carried out at different initial levels of glucose (GO) in the presence of 10 g L-1 casein demonstrated that the reference strain was able to release higher levels of biosurfactants in the medium at 5.0 <= G(0) <= 10 g L-1 (B-max = 104-110 mg L-1). The recombinant strain exhibited slightly lower levels of biosurfactants(B-max = 90-104 mg L-1)but only at higher glucose concentrations (G(0) >= 20 g L-1). Under these nutritional conditions, the fluorescence intensity linked to the production of GFP was shown to be associated with the cell concentration even after achievement of the stationary phase.
   CONCLUSION: The ability of the genetically-modified strain to simultaneously overproduce biosurfactant and GFP even at low biomass concentration makes it an interesting candidate for use as a biological indicator to monitor indirectly the biosurfactant production in bioremediation treatments.

AB  - We describe a design algorithm to build a cardiac myocyte with specific spatial dimensions and physiological function. Using a computational model of a cardiac muscle cell, we modeled calcium (Ca2+) wave dynamics in a cardiac myocyte with controlled spatial dimensions. The modeled myocyte was replicated in vitro when primary neonate rat ventricular myocytes were cultured on micropatterned substrates. The myocytes remodel to conform to the two dimensional boundary conditions and assume the shape of the printed extracellular matrix island. Mechanical perturbation of the myocyte with an atomic force microscope results in calcium-induced calcium release from intracellular stores and the propagation of a Ca2+ wave, as indicated by high speed video microscopy using fluorescent indicators of intracellular Ca2+. Analysis and comparison of the measured wavefront dynamics with those simulated in the computer model reveal that the engineered myocyte behaves as predicted by the model. These results are important because they represent the use of computer modeling, computer-aided design, and physiological experiments to design and validate the performance of engineered cells. The ability to successfully engineer biological cells and tissues for assays or therapeutic implants will require design algorithms and tools for quality and regulatory assurance.

AB  - New clinical indicators. Health-related quality of life. In the last decades the need of better measurements of health outcomes has increased the interest for new clinical indicators. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has emerged in this context as a multidimensional model approach where the patient is the exclusive source of information. The main objective of HRQoL measurement is to provide a global evaluation of the impact of diseases and the consequences of treatments over the daily life of the patients. The instruments developed for that purpose are questionnaires; either generic - for the comparison between different diseases-, or specific-aimed to evaluate particular conditions. These questionnaires must demonstrate several psychometric properties, such as reliability, validity, responsiveness, and for some authors also feasibility. In many areas, HRQoL studies have demonstrated to increase the knowledge of the natural history of diseases and its global consequences, beyond the classic health outcomes information based on morbidity and mortality rates. This knowledge may assist in the design of epidemiological studies and improve the comparison of strategies in therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, some controversial issues remain such as the clinical implications of absolute scores obtained, and the need for updating the content of the instruments in accordance with the changes in natural history of diseases under evaluation.

AB  - Twenty-one strains of commercial wine yeasts and 17 non-Saccharomyces species of different provenance were surveyed for their ability to produce hydrogen sulphide in synthetic grape juice medium indicator agar with different nitrogen sources, as well as in natural grape juice. Bacto Biggy agar, a commercially available bismuth-containing agar, was used to compare our results with others previously reported in the literature. Under identical physiological conditions, the strains used in this study displayed similar growth patterns but varied in colony color intensity in all media, suggesting significant differences in sulphite reductase activity. Sulphite reductase activity was absent for only one strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All other strains produced an off-odor to different extents, depending significantly (P < 0.05) on medium composition. Within the same species of some non-Saccharomyces yeasts, strain variation existed as it did for Saccharomyces. In natural musts, strains fen into three major groups: (i) nonproducers, (ii) must-composition-dependent producers, and (iii) invariable producers. In synthetic media, the formation of sulphide by strains of S. cerevisiae results from the reduction of sulphate. Therefore, this rapid screening methodology promises to be a very useful tool for winemakers for determining the risk of hydrogen sulphide formation by a given yeast strain in a specific grape juice.

AB  - Calls to use target, limit and threshold reference points to achieve precautionary management goals have increased substantially in recent years. For many fisheries there is little chance of conducting formal stock assessments, and indicators of stock status have to be based on changes in measurable quantities such as catch rates and percentiles of the length distribution of the catch. Use of such empirical indicators for management decisions also requires a choice of appropriate reference or trigger levels for the indicators. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to examine the performance of alternative indicators and associated reference points in terms of their ability to correctly identify the biological conditions that they were designed to measure. This study examines the performance of several potential empirical indicators for broadbill swordfish off eastern Australia, taking into account uncertainties in stock structure, current status, and future trends in fishing effort. Indicators based on catch rates are shown to be potentially very misleading. In contrast, indicators based on the mean length or mean weight of the catch perform better, because these quantities change in a more predictable manner with abundance. Nevertheless, reference points based on these quantities are frequently triggered either too early or too late.

AB  - The ability to identify genetic regulation of quantitative traits is often complicated by environmentally induced variation. The purpose of this study was to determine if the variance in biomass and physiological traits is larger for populations of genetically distinct individuals (genets) compared with populations of genetically identical individuals (ramets) of the same species. Spartium junceum L. was used for this study because it is a weedy species, and variation in quantitative traits is important for its invasive characteristic. Several mean growth traits were significantly different between ramet and genet populations. The variance in biomass traits was higher for genet populations in 26 of 30 comparisons with ramet populations. In contrast, few mean physiological traits differed between ramet and genet populations, and trait variance was equal between the two population types in 23 out of 30 comparisons. Thus, even under uniform growth conditions in a greenhouse, environmental variance accounts for a large proportion of population variance in physiological traits. Environmental variance also accounted for ca. 33% of phenotypic variance in biomass traits. The results of this study have important implications for common garden and reaction norm studies of genetic determination of quantitative physiological traits.

AB  - Breeding adult male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., develop an elaborate breeding signal, the primary component of which is ventral red coloration. In laboratory dominance tests staged under illumination conditions that maintained or eliminated male perceived coloration, this study examined (1) the relationship between male coloration and fighting ability and (2) the applicability of three hypotheses for the current function of male coloration in male-male competitive interactions. In pairs of males from a Long Island, NY, population matched for size and prior dominance experience, the more brightly coloured males were more likely to initiate and win under white light. The effect of colour on dominance success was lost under replicates illuminated by coloured-light treatments that masked the signal by eliminating its visual contrast. The loss of competitive advantage associated with more conspicuous coloration was not an artefact of illumination manipulations, since the effects seen under white light were maintained under a coloured-light treatment that maintained male coloration. These data suggest that red belly coloration of males functions as a threat signal. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Effects of sub-optimal housing on inactivity vary across species and experiments, probably because inactivity is heterogeneous, reflecting both positive states (e.g. relaxation) and negative ones (e.g. fear). We therefore aimed to identify specific subtypes of inactivity that could indicate poor welfare in mink, by comparing their behaviour in enriched and non-enriched conditions (the former having been previously demonstrated to be highly preferred by mink and to enhance their welfare). We assessed this in three groups of subjects, as well as after housing conditions were reversed for the last group. During live scans, inactive animals were scored for posture, location, and whether awake or apparently asleep. Data on temperament and physiological stress indicators were also collected for one group; these confirmed that non-enriched housing increased faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM; P = 0.040). Non-enriched housing also increased locomotor stereotypy in females (sex x housing: P = 0.004). Inactivity in the nest-box (vs. in the open cage) was higher among females in non-enriched housing (housing x sex: P < 0.001), and increased by 20% of observations after enrichment removal (P = 0.018) for both sexes. Furthermore, males With fearful temperaments spent the most time inactive in the nest-box (sex x temperament: P = 0.054), while females whose FCM decreased most when given enrichment also showed the largest decreases in this behaviour (sex x FCM change: P = 0.019). Together, this suggests that inactivity in the nest-box may reflect anxiety-induced hiding. Lying awake (i.e. prone with eyes open) was also higher in non-enriched housing (3.1% of observations vs. 1.7%; P = 0.002); furthermore, this subtype of inactivity increased after enrichment removal (by 1.0% of observations; P = 0.021), and decreased when non-enriched mink were given enrichment (by 2.4% of observations; P = 0.004). This behaviour did not co-vary with fearfulness, however, nor with FCM (both P > 0.05). This suggests that lying awake is not fear-related (e.g. not reflecting enhanced vigilance) but instead reflects some other negative state. Effects on inactivity subtypes as defined by posture were less consistent. For example, time spent lying belly down tended to decrease in mink moved from non-enriched to enriched cages (P = 0.054), but enriched mink spent significantly less time belly down (in one of the three groups; P = 0.002). Overall, two subtypes of inactivity, lying in the nest-box and lying awake seem likely to be valid indicators of housing-induced poor welfare in this species, being consistently increased by non-enriched cages. Lying in the nest-box may indicate fear or anxiety, and lying awake, a boredom-like state. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The First Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE 1) intensive experiment, conducted between November 14 and December 15, 1995, covered an oceanographically complex region, including the subtropical (ST), Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ), Subantarctic (SA), and polar water masses. Oceanographic and atmospheric sampling to identify the chemical and biological communities that might affect biologically produced, aerosol precursors in these water masses was carried out from the RV Discoverer and FRV Southern Surveyor. Sea surface temperature was not a good indicator of water mass during ACE 1. The physical structure east of 147.5(degrees)E was more complex than west of this longitude. Nutrient concentrations (nitrate, silicate) in the mixed layer increased, but ammonia concentrations decreased from ST to polar waters. Ammonia concentrations in surface waters exceeded > 5 mu M, and ammonia fluxes peaked at 12 mu M m(-2) d(-1) in ST water near Cape Grim between November 27 and 30. Seawater dimethyl sulfide (DMSsw) concentrations averaged 1.7 +/- 1.1 nM with maximum values near 6 nM in ST waters. The flux of dimethyl sulfide to the atmosphere averaged 4.7 +/- 5.0 mu M m(-2) d(-1), with peak fluxes (> 40 mu M m(-2) d(-1)) in SA water. DMSsw increased significantly only in SA waters during the experiment. Surface chlorophyll a concentrations measured from the FRV Southern Surveyor ranged between 0.3 and 0.6 mg m(-3). Surface chlorophyll-a concentrations along the Discoverer cruise track were similar, but 5 phytoplankton blooms (> 1 mg m(3)) were found. Integrated column chlorophylls ranged from 29.4 mg m(-2) in SA water to 53.2 mg m(-2) in ST water. Modeled primary production rates were ranged between 409 mg carbon m(-2) d(-1) in the polar front to 3180 mg carbon m(-2) d(-1) in ST water near Cape Grim. Mixed layer phytoplankton growth rates, estimated from net primary production, were 0.31 d(-1) in the SAF to 1.07 d(-1) in STCZ water east of Tasmania. Grazing dilution experiments showed microzooplankton grazing and phytoplankton growth rates were tightly coupled, with net growth rates ranging from - 0.13 d(-1) to 0.22 d(-1). During the ACE 1 intensive period, the surface waters were in transition from the deeply mixed, winter conditions to the shallowly stratified, spring conditions. The spring phytoplankton bloom was just beginning in the northern water masses, and isolated blooms were present at several locations in SA surface waters. The low standing stocks of chlorophyll and tightly coupled grazing rates may have been responsible for the low concentrations of DMS and NH3 in the region, and the generally low fluxes of these compounds to the atmosphere during the ACE 1 intensive experiment.

AB  - Key elements of Industry 4.0 are the digitization of products and production, enterprise information systems, robotic workplaces, communication infrastructure, and of course, employees. Industry 4.0 transforms production from stand-alone automated units to fully integrated automated and continuously optimized production environments. According to the prediction of Industry 4.0, new global networks will be created based on the interconnection of production equipment into CPS systems. These systems will be the basic building block of the so-called "smart factories", and will be able to exchange information autonomously, trigger the necessary actions in response to current conditions and mutually independent inspections. The aim of this article is to describe the issue of readiness models for the Industry 4.0 concept, which are commonly used as tools for conceptualizing and measuring the maturity of an organization or process related to a specific target state. Characteristic for the models is their use because, on this basis, it is possible to identify the current readiness for the concept of Industry 4.0 comprehensively in the whole company or in various sub-areas.

AB  - An expanded dinuclear copper(II) complex (1) derived from a biphenyl-based hexaazamacrocyle (L) was synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray analysis, exhibiting a boat-shaped cavity with an elongated Cu-II...Cu-II distance of 11.01 angstrom. The dinuclear copper(II) complex was investigated for a verity of biologically relevant anions including carboxylates (oxalate, citrate, tartrate, glutamate, adipate, acetate and benzoate), oxoanions (phosphate, sulphate, perchlorate and nitrate), and halides (fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide) by competitive fluorescence titrations via indicator displacement assay (IDA) using an external dye (Eosin Y) in water-methanol solution at neutral pH. The receptor was shown to exhibit strong affinity for oxalate, providing the binding trend: oxalate (log K=6.07)>citrate (log K=5.74)>phosphate (log K=5.02)>tartrate (log K=4.78)>glutamate (log K=4.42)>adipate (log K=4.31)>acetate (log K=4.14)>benzoate (log K=4.01). No interaction was observed for other anions including sulphate, perchlorate, nitrate, fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide under the identical conditions.

AB  - In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) initiated a program for the re-evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavor ingredients. This publication, fifth in the series, evaluates the safety of NFCs containing linalool and/or other characteristic mono- and sesquiterpenoid tertiary alcohols and esters using the safety evaluation procedure published by the FEMA Expert Panel in 2005 and updated in 2018. The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of the NFC intended for commerce and organization of the chemical constituents of each NFC into well-defined congeneric groups. The safety of each NFC is evaluated using the well-established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept in addition to data on absorption, metabolism and toxicology of both the constituent congeneric groups and the NFCs. Sixteen NFCs, derived from the Lavandula, Aniba, Elettaria, Daucus, Salvia, Coriandrum, Ribes, Guaiacum/Bulnesia, Citrus, Pogostemon, Melaleuca and Michelia genera, were affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under their conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients based on an evaluation of each NFC and the constituents and congeneric groups therein.

AB  - Peatlands accumulate organic matter (OM) under anaerobic conditions. After drainage for forestry or agriculture, microbial respiration and peat oxidation induce OM losses and change the stoichiometry of the remaining organic material. Here, we (i) evaluate whether land use (cropland CL, grassland GL, forest FL, natural peatland NL) is associated with different peat stoichiometry, (ii) study how peat stoichiometry changes with OM content and (iii) infer the fate of nitrogen upon soil degradation. Organic C and soil N were measured for 1310 samples from 48 sites in Switzerland, and H and O for 1165. The soil OM content and C/N ratio were most sensitive to land use and are hence best suited as indicators for peatland degradation. OM contents (CL<GL<FL<NL), H/C, O/C, C/N ratios, and OM oxidation states were significantly different between land use types in top- and subsoils. With decreasing bulk OM content, C was relatively depleted while H and particularly N were higher. The data suggest very high N mobilization rates from strongly decomposed peat in agricultural topsoil. A comparison to peat C and N from mostly intact peatlands of the Northern hemisphere reveals that agriculture and, to a lesser extent, forestry induce a progressed state of soil degradation.

AB  - Soil quality is a measurement used to calculate how well the soil will perform its functions and ensures the assessment of soils based on their physical, chemical and biological characteristics. The aim of this study was to facilitate the determination of soil quality, with soil properties selected by multi-criteria application, in a shorter time compared to that of conventional soils tests. A soil quality index (SQI) was determined by measuring the soil parameters under laboratory and field conditions in lands where agriculture has been taking place for many years. Based on the results of the factor analysis the 12 soil characteristics were selected for assessing the SQIs of each of the soil samples. The SQI results determined from physical, chemical, and biological soil properties with regards to total weight was calculated as 35.96%, 33.92%, and 30.12%, respectively. Based on the results of this study, it was determined that only 4 physical, 5 chemical and 3 biological properties could be used to evaluate soil quality. The selected indicators can be used in subsequent studies for the assessment of soil quality in areas where intensive agriculture has been used for many years.

AB  - Since the first reports on foam sclerotherapy, multiple studies have been conducted to determine the physical properties and behavior of foams, but relatively little is known about their biological effects on the endothelial cells lining the vessel wall. Moreover, a systematic comparison of the biological performance of foams produced with different methods has not been carried out yet. Herein, a 2D in vitro method was developed to compare efficacy of commercially available polidocanol injectable foam (PEM,Varithena) and physician-compounded foams (PCFs). Endothelial cell attachment upon treatment with foam was quantified as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy, and was correlated with foam physical characteristics and administration conditions. An ex vivo method was also developed to establish the disruption and permeabilisation of the endothelium caused by sclerosing agents. It relied on the quantitation of extravasated bovine serum albumin conjugated to Evans Blue, as an indicator of endothelial permeability. In our series of comparisons, PEM presented a greater overall efficacy compared to PCFs, across the different biological models, which was attributed to its drainage dynamics and gas formulation. This is consistent with earlier studies that indicated superior physical cohesiveness of PEM compared to PCFs.

AB  - We used the Slacks-based Model (SBM) to calculate the environmental efficiency value of industrial cluster districts in China based on the panel data of 30 regions from 2007 to 2014, at the same time, in order to make a comparative analysis with the economic efficiency values not considering carbon emissions, the model presented by Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) for estimating technical and scale inefficiencies in data envelopment analysis was used to calculate the environmental efficiency not considering the desirable output of carbon emissions, and we also analyzed the regional differences in China's environmental efficiency. The results showed that the environmental efficiency value of industrial cluster districts in China ranged between 0.83 and 0.94 not considering carbon emission, and it had a certain degree of reduction when considering the effect of undesirable output, maintaining values between 0.74 and 0.84, and which showed that there was much room for improving the environmental condition of the industrial cluster districts in China Carbon emission had a great impact on the environment of China's industrial cluster, which resulted in a greater degree of efficiency loss. And it showed that the carbon emissions showed a great difference to the sensitivity degree of influence on regional environmental efficiency.

AB  - Modeling of a clinical lab carbon footprint is performed in this study from the aspects of electricity, water, gas consumption and waste production from lab instruments. These environmental impact indicators can be expressed in the form of the CO2 equivalent. For each type of clinical test, the corresponding consumption of energy resources and the production of plastics and papers are taken into consideration. In addition, the basic lab infrastructures such as heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, lights, and computers also contribute to the environmental impact. Human comfort is to be taken into account when optimizing the operation of lab instruments, and is related to the operation of HVAC and lighting systems. The detailed modeling takes into consideration the types of clinical tests, operating times, and instrument specifications. Two ways of disposing waste are classified. Moreover, the indoor environment is modeled. A case study of the Biochrom 30+ amino acid analyzer physiological system in Alder Hey Children's Hospital is carried out, and the methods of mitigating the overall environmental impacts are discussed. Furthermore, the influence of climate on the results is investigated by using the climate data in Liverpool and Athens in October.

AB  - In conditions of modern economic and political destabilisation in Ukraine, human capital of the child population is considered as the most reliable indicator of socioeconomic development of the country and its regions. The primary goal of the study is the analysis of health status as the main element of human capital among the child population aged 0-14, and external and family environmental factors influencing this population group in the city of Lviv (in the light of available statistics and materials of the author's own sociological research). Research results show a potential crisis of human capital among the child population in Lviv city. Results of own field research show a statistically important correlation between the willingness of parents to have more children and the following independent variables: number of members in the household, and the household's income. The state of health among the child population showed a significant correlation between the following variables: household's income, life satisfaction among parents, availability of healthcare in the place of residence, financial affordability of healthcare, physical activity among children, influence of noise and unpleasant scents.

AB  - Assessing the level of food security requires a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of government policies to support the agro-industrial complex and determining the nature of the analyzed socio-economic processes in order to determine the key factors that influence on them, identify weaknesses and potential problem situations that have a negative impact on food security. The result of the construction of indicative systems is the possibility of interpreting the results obtained in order to develop a state program for ensuring food security and assessing the effectiveness of the proposed measures of influence. For modeling purposes, the method named as "Partial Least Squares Path Modeling" or "Projecton Latent Structures Path Modeling" was used based on panel data from the regions of southern Russia for 2014-2016. The obtained results confirm the possibility of using indicative models for constructing multivariate forecast estimates for the influence of scenario variants of the state support policy concerning the agro-industrial complex on the level of competitiveness of domestic producers and resistance to negative external influences, as well as modeling of general or partial equilibrium conditions in food markets in order to assess the appropriateness of state impact in case if some indicators overcame critical values and food security reduced.

AB  - Air quality became a concern of highest priority in cities and town agglomerations, worldwide. Professional environmental monitoring strategies are prerequisites for supplying appropriate programmes destined to maintain air quality. Due to their capacity of bioaccumulation, tree species may be used as biomonitoring agents within programmes of monitoring air quality in urban spaces. The present study aims to emphasize the ability of A. hippocastanum L., and T. cordata Mill. leaves to be used as biomonitoring agents of air pollution with Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd. Atomic Absorption Spectrometry was used for quantification of the heavy metals from leave matrices. The statistic software package IBM-SPPS Statistics was used for statistical analyzes. The results show that A. hippocastanum L. leaves may be considered as a useful tool for biomonitoring Cu pollution and T. cordata Mill. leaves, for biomonitoring Pb, Cd, and Zn, pollution, in conditions of air pollution with Pb, and alarming air Cu concentrations. Gasoline/Diesel exhausts and abrasion of tires and brake linings are supposed to be the major sources of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd air pollution in considered urban area.

AB  - The availability of suitable spawning habitats for gravel-spawning fish is an important indicator for Alpine river reaches regarding hydro-and morphodynamic components of fluvial ecosystems. This paper presents advances in habitat modelling techniques of suitable spawning habitat conditions for brown trout (Salmo trutta) by applying multivariate fuzzy-logical habitat modelling in combination with a three-dimensional numerical sediment-transport model. The fuzzy-logical approach considers multiple particle size classes to evaluate the suitability of sediment characteristics (sediment spawning index, SSI). It is then combined with hydraulic characteristics to compute spawning habitat suitability (HSIspawn). The study site is part of the River Spoel in the Swiss National Park in the Central Alps of Switzerland. The modelling approach was applied to two spawning seasons (2009 and 2010) and provides information about the spatial distribution of suitable spawning habitats. The simulated results indicate a good model performance when comparing the simulation results with observed spawning redds. The predictability of the modelling approach allows further investigations into new management scenarios to improve the hydro-and morphodynamic situation in the River Spoel and to increase the availability of suitable spawning habitats for brown trout.

AB  - Organic matter in peat deposits undergoes slow microbial decomposition, which causes permanent material change, including reduction in volume of solids, and is a significant factor in the development of creep settlements for such deposits. Microorganisms accountable for decomposition are readily available in peat, although generally less populous compared with other soils on account of the unfavourable environment. This paper presents a novel experimentallaboratory study that stimulates the growth of microorganisms in a fibrous peat and hence its decomposition rate. The carbon/nitrogen ratio and pH value of the peat were adjusted within optimum ranges for microbial activity to occur by blending sufficient amounts of pulverised fuel ash and urea with the wet peat. This process did not adversely affect indigenous microbial populations within the peat. Blended material was incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 30 degrees C over periods of up to 126 days. Microbial populations increased by approximately 3500-and 1800-fold under aerobic and anaerobic incubation, respectively, which was an indicator of increased decomposition rate. Water content, specific gravity of solids, volatile organic content and fibre content were measured both before and after incubation treatment. Fibre content was found to be approximately inversely proportional to incubation period, with relatively greater reductions in fibre content occurring for blended material under aerobic conditions.

AB  - This work illustrates the toxicological impact of pesticide methyl parathion (MP) (dust-2 % active ingredient, a.i.) on growth and reproduction performance in tropical earthworms: Metaphire posthuma (endogeic), Lampito mauritii (anecic) and Allolobophora parva (epigeic). A total of three concentrations (a.i. g kg(-1) dry test soil), 1.00 (T-1), 1.125 (T-2) and 2.25 (T-3) of MP, were applied in test substrate to examine the impact on mortality, individual live weight changes and reproduction patterns in test species over 60 days under laboratory conditions. MP caused significant mortality in all tested species, and median lethal dose (LD50) for L. mauritii, M. posthuma and A. parva was 24.85, 23.64 and 22.67 mg a.i., respectively. The individual live weight loss was 27.0-37.0 % in L. mauritii, 36.0-57.1 % in M. posthuma and 1.2-11.0 % in A. parva in different test concentrations. The pesticide-exposed worms produced less cocoons than control, but in L. mauritii, an unusual reproduction (hormesis) was recorded. Results suggested the species-specific toxicity of MP against tropical earthworms.

AB  - Conditional mating strategies enable individuals to modulate their mating behaviour depending on 'individual status' to maximise fitness. Theory predicts that variation in individual quality can lead to differences in mating preferences. However, empirical evidence is scarce particular in terms of variation in male and female strategies. Here, we experimentally investigated quality-dependent variation in mating preferences concerning reliable quality indicators in Pelvicachromis taeniatus, a colourful cichlid fish with mutual mate choice and ornamentation. Males as well as females were artificially manipulated in phenotypic quality by different feeding regimes. Ornamentation was connected to individual quality in both sexes. Males and females showed conditional mating strategies in different directions. Males showed prudent choice by preferring females of similar quality. In contrast to males, low-quality females preferred highly ornamented males, whereas high-quality females showed neither preferences for high- nor for low-quality males. The results suggest that individuals aim for specific benefits depending on individual quality. Furthermore, the conflicting conditional mating preferences of males and females might lead to sexual conflict, implicating a highly dynamical mating system that evolves even in absence of environmental changes.

TI  - The pseudonymn franchise: exercise conditions of a posture indicator
T2  - NEOHELICON
LA  - English
AB  - According to Michel Foucault, the interpretation of texts in certain areas-the literary domain in particular-is subject to a "fixed position" or "lock", supposedly "provided" by the authorial figure, at least when functional modalities are not manipulated or perverted. As a specific institution, literature "authorizes" certain impostures which would not be sanctioned in other arenas of socio-cultural practice. This "franchise", however, which was granted to the corporation of men of letters, appears to be subject to restrictions. The establishment of an "authorial posture" (J,rme Meizoz) must adhere, in effect, to certain constraints that different types and uses of the pseudonym forefront and bring to light. In terms of posture, it would seem that the writer is not permitted to undo, by use of an inauthentic signature, certain parameters of his identity without designating the fictional nature of this process. Alternatively and otherwise, it falls within the nature and scope of discourse to restore the foundations of truthfulness which are presumed to, and perhaps ultimately must, underlie any statement issued by the author. This essay proposes to expose the workings and functions of such authorial stance by exploring the relationship between and among the strategies of authors who have adopted this particular brand of "pseudonym"aEuro"the heteronymous type, and critical reception of their texts.

AB  - The ability of the brain to adapt to environmental demands implies that neurons can change throughout life. The extent to which single neurons actually change remains largely unstudied, however. To evaluate how functional properties of single neurons change over time, we devised a way to perform in vivo time-lapse electrophysiological recordings from the exact same neuron. We monitored the contralateral and ipsilateral sensory-evoked spiking activity of individual L2/3 neurons from the somatosensory cortex of mice. At the end of the first recording session, we electroporated the neuron with a DNA plasmid to drive GFP expression. Then, 2 wk later, we visually guided a recording electrode in vivo to the GFP-expressing neuron for the second time. We found that contralateral and ipsilateral evoked responses (i.e., probability to respond, latency, and preference), and spontaneous activity of individual L2/3 pyramidal neurons are stable under control conditions, but that this stability could be rapidly disrupted. Contralateral whisker deprivation induced robust changes in sensory-evoked response profiles of single neurons. Our experiments provide a framework for studying the stability and plasticity of single neurons over long time scales using electrophysiology.

AB  - Adjuvants are additional ingredients used to make herbicide treatment more effective by lowering herbicide rate together with maintaining or enhancing biological efficacy and crop selectivity. Spray solution and herbicide activity can be influenced by adjuvants in many ways. Dividing adjuvants into particular groups is often complicated as they can influence more physical characteristics of spray solution and we still miss detailed terminology. From the point of view of their function we can classify them as surfactants, colorants - spray indicators, drift control agents, foam adjuvants, thickeners, deposition adjuvants, adhesive agents, antifoam agents, water conditioning agents, buffering agents, UV absorbents etc. The most important group of adjuvants is represented by surfactants. These agents enhance biological activity of herbicides by increasing and accelerating the penetration of active ingredient into leaf tissue. Surfactant molecules are amphipatic - composed of two parts, each of them attracted by different phase. One end of the molecule (head group) is hydrophilic while the other (tail) is hydrophobic, creating a "bridge" between two phases and thus decreasing surface tension of spray drops. Following agents are used as surfactatns: mineral and plant (mostly esterified) oils, or synthetic compounds like dissociable salts or esters, non-ionic surfactants based on alcohols and fatty acids, organosilicates and other chemicals.

AB  - The effects of 4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) on oxidative stress induced by glutathione (GSH) depletion in single human erythrocytes were investigated using microfluidic technique and fluorescence imaging. Most cell-based toxicity evaluations on GSH are performed with bulk experiments based on analysis of cell populations. This work established a single-cell toxicity evaluation method to statistically analyze the GSH amount in single erythrocytes incubated with AAP in different concentrations. The experimental conditions of cell flow rate and cell concentration were optimized. The GSH contents in erythrocytes decreased with increasing dose of AAP. At low concentration, AAP had a little effect on GSH; while at high concentration, MP led to GSH depletion reaching a maximum of 14.53%. The depletion of GSH leads to a significant shift to a more oxidizing intracellular environment. This study provides basic data for presenting the effect of MP on GSH in erythrocytes and is helpful for understanding its toxicity during the blood transportation process. In addition, it will also complement studies on the environmental risk assessment of AAP pollution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Walkability is a well-known count of how conducive an area is to walking to and from chosen destinations. Calculation of a walk score is widely used in accessibility studies to determine the ease or difficulty of travel by foot between one point and another. The main purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated methodology (Remote Sensing, GIS and Spatial Web Technology) to model urban green space walkability, which enables local residents to make informed decisions that will improve their living conditions and physical health related to the neighbourhood environmental quality. We discuss the modelling of urban green space walkability by utilising web-based Geographical Information System (web-GIS) to calculate eco-friendly walk scores based on the presence of green spaces by integrating Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) data and other GIS datasets. We use this spatial web technology to help local residents make decisions related to neighbourhood environmental quality, such as how to choose an eco-friendly living space when buying a home or how to find the shortest or greenest route to walk to improve their health.

AB  - The growing introduction of new technologies inside vehicles represents a set of extra information sources. Its use can interfere with the driving activity and induce performance decrements. An on-road experiment was conducted to investigate how drivers reacted to the simultaneous interaction with in-vehicle systems. Forty-eight subjects (elderly, reference and novice) participated in the tests. They were asked to interact with one (road guidance system) or two (road guidance system and mobile phone) on-board devices. Their performance was evaluated for the turn left manoeuvres and main effects of system conditions were revealed. The simultaneous interaction with both in-vehicle systems induced participants to some performance decrements on the driving task: higher number of late activations of the turning indicator; lower mean speeds before the intersection; lower values of instant speed at the beginning of the turn manoeuvre; higher steering wheel variability; activations of the braking pedal with less pressure, later, and performing a higher number of strokes; and also less glances towards important areas of the environment. No significant difference was observed for the guidance task. The comparison between driver groups' performance did not reveal enough significant differences in order to draw a general conclusion.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed a rapidly growing interest in the biological basis of human mate choice. Here we review recent studies that demonstrate preferences for traits which might reveal genetic quality to prospective mates, with potential but still largely unknown influence on offspring fitness. These include studies assessing visual, olfactory and auditory preferences for potential good-gene indicator traits, such as dominance or bilateral symmetry. Individual differences in these robust preferences mainly arise through within and between individual variation in condition and reproductive status. Another set of studies have revealed preferences for traits indicating complementary genes, focussing on discrimination of dissimilarity at genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). As in animal studies, we are only just beginning to understand how preferences for specific traits vary and inter-relate, how consideration of good and compatible genes can lead to substantial variability in individual mate choice decisions and how preferences expressed in one sensory modality may reflect those in another. Humans may be an ideal model species in which to explore these interesting complexities.

AB  - Global climate change is expected to shift species ranges polewards, with a risk of range contractions and population declines of especially high-Arctic species. We built species distribution models for Svalbard-nesting pink-footed geese to relate their occurrence to environmental and climatic variables, and used the models to predict their distribution under a warmer climate scenario. The most parsimonious model included mean May temperature, the number of frost-free months and the proportion of moist and wet moss-dominated vegetation in the area. The two climate variables are indicators for whether geese can physiologically fulfil the breeding cycle or not and the moss vegetation is an indicator of suitable feeding conditions. Projections of the distribution to warmer climate scenarios propose a large north- and eastward expansion of the potential breeding range on Svalbard even at modest temperature increases (1 and 2 degrees C increase in summer temperature, respectively). Contrary to recent suggestions regarding future distributions of Arctic wildlife, we predict that warming may lead to a further growth in population size of, at least some, Arctic breeding geese.

AB  - Thirty gravid, female shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynehus platorynchus) were captured in the Lower Missouri River in March 2004 to evaluate the effectiveness of physiology, telemetry and remote sensor technology coupled with change point analysis in identifying when and where Scaphirhynchus sturgeon spawn. Captured sturgeons were instrumented with ultrasonic transmitters and with archival data storage tags (DST) that recorded temperature and pressure. Female sturgeon were tracked through the suspected spawning period. Thereafter, attempts were made to recapture fish to evaluate spawning success. At the time of transmitter implantation, blood and an ovarian biopsy were taken. Reproductive hormones and cortisol were measured in blood. Polarization indices and germinal vesicle breakdown were assessed on the biopsied oocytes to determine readiness to spawn. Behavioral data collected using telemetry and DST sensors were used to determine the direction and magnitude of possible spawning-related movements and to identify the timing of potential spawning events. Upon recapture observations of the ovaries and blood chemistry provided measures of spawning success and comparative indicators to explain differences in observed behavior. Behavioral and physiological indicators of spawning interpreted along with environmental measures may assist in the determination of variables that may cue sturgeon reproduction and the conditions under which sturgeon successfully spawn.

AB  - The activity of glycolytic enzymes and the expression levels of myosin RNA was monitored in the white muscle of juvenile spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) reared under different temperature regimes. A group of individually tagged juvenile spotted wolffish was reared for 6 months at 4, 6, 8, and 12 degrees C. After the rearing trial, biopsy samples were taken from white muscle of each individual and the relationship between individual growth, enzyme activity, and myosin expression was investigated. A positive relationship between the activities of two glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) and individual growth rate was observed. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and specially developed primers for myosin mRNA and 18S rRNA for spotted wolffish, we were able to detect differences in the relative myosin expression between experimental groups, and a positive relationship between myosin expression and specific growth rates was observed. These methods may be useful as an indicator of growth rate in wild fish and a fast and reliable indicator of growth potential under culture conditions. The method also has the potential to measure differences in white muscle synthesis in fish reared under variable environmental parameters and during different life history stages.

AB  - The optical character of waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) is of concern for several reasons. Algal photosynthesis, which produces oxygen for waste oxidation in WSPs, is influenced by attenuation of. sunlight in ponds. Disinfection in WSPs is influenced by optical characteristics because solar UV exposure usually dominates inactivation. The optical nature of WSPs effluent also affects assimilation by receiving waters. Despite the importance of light behaviour in WSPs, few studies have been made of their optical characteristics. We discuss simple optical measures suitable for routine monitoring of WSPs (including at sites remote from laboratories): optical density of filtrates - an index of dissolved coloured organic (humic) matter, visual clarity - to provide an estimate of the beam attenuation coefficient (a fundamental quantity needed for optical modelling) colour (hoe) - as an indicator of general WSP 'condition' and irradiance attenuation quantifying depth of light penetration. The value of optical characterisation of WSPs is illustrated with reference to optical data for WSPs in. NZ (including high-rate algal ponds) treating dairy cattle wastewater versus domestic sewage.,We encourage increased research on optical characteristics of WSPs and the incorporation of optical measures in monitoring and modelling of WSP performance.

AB  - Periphyton communities on artificial substrata were successfully utilised as a biological indicator of the potential eutrophic effects of wastewater discharge into coastal waters off Perth, Western Australia. Biomass and percentage carbonate content measurements of periphyton communities grown in situ indicated that the periphyton primary production (organic weight) was enhanced in the vicinity of the discharge outlets, with a significant negative correlation between distance north of the northern outlet in Whitfords Lagoon and periphyton organic weight (OW) observed in autumn at a depth of 4 m (r = -0.704, P < 0.001). However, this response was primarily limited to the relatively calm autumn season and substrata at depths of 2 m and 4 m. Thus, in favourable conditions phytoplankton and high relief reef communities are more likely to exhibit a eutrophic influence (in the form of enhanced primary production) of the treated wastewater discharge. Laboratory studies confirmed that treated wastewater, diluted 100-fold to estimate surface concentrations above the wastewater outfalls in the field, stimulates periphyton growth above levels recorded in unpolluted seawater (F = 12.485; P = 0.0073).

AB  - We evaluated the effect of various genotypes of pea (Pisum sativum L.) to delay the development of ascochyta blight, caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella pinodes, at the seedling stage under controlled conditions. We assessed leaflets, stipules and stems, separately. We compared genotypes on the basis of four variables assessing resistance: incubation period (IP), appearance of disease scoring 3 (DS3), disease progress rate (r(d)) and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). For leaves, a continuous variation was observed between pea lines in disease severity at all times and disease progress curves were similar for the various genotypes. Partial resistance was defined as a delay in first symptom appearance and disease development. Resistance factors are thought to be involved in the very early stages of the interaction. Similar results were obtained for stipules and leaflets, suggesting similar mechanisms of resistance in these two organs. Stem and leaf resistances were also strongly correlated. We found that IP could discriminate genotypes but that factors associated with disease progress (DS3, AUDPC and r(d)) were more informative. We suggest that further genetic analyses should be based on growth-chamber methods, with AUDPC as the variable measured.

AB  - Former industrial landfills on Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge were found to contain polychlorinated biphenyls (Aroclor-1254) at levels posing risks to wildlife. This case study reports on a risk assessment that used both deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) methods to provide risk managers with point estimates of risk, as well as multiple descriptors of uncertainty and variability around the risk estimate. Problem formulation identified mink (Mustela vison) as the higher trophic level assessment endpoint. Exposure analysis estimated Aroclor 1254 doses to mink using a multi-species food web model with probabilistic exposure parameters. Toxicity reference value point estimates and distributions were obtained from the literature. Risk characterization used quotient and probabilistic methodologies. Deterministic quotient analysis corroborated remedial goals originally established in the Record of Derision. Probabilistic risk analysis estimated projected post-remediation soil conditions as having a 7% probability of inducing significant reproductive impairment in mink. A probabilistic approach, while giving greater insight into the consequences of uncertainty and variability inherent in data and risk analyses, can present risk managers with a more ambiguous basis for proceeding with a remedial action. This suggests that more sophisticated risk assessment techniques will not necessarily provide an easier path to remedial decisions.

AB  - A variety of physiological and biochemical measures have been proposed in the literature as indicators of environmental quality. Here we report studies which were designed to determine if hemolymph hemocyanin concentrations in blue crabs Callinectes sapidus could be correlated with environmental water quality. To this end hemocyanin concentrations were measured in hemolymph of blue crabs collected from North Carolina, Florida, and Texas, USA. Blue crabs from isolated estuarine systems in eastern North Carolina (i.e. Albemarle/Pamlico Sound area) had significantly lower concentrations of hemocyanin in their hemolymph than crabs from reference areas (i.e. Core and Currituck Sounds). These lower concentrations could be correlated with reduced dissolved oxygen and chronic hypoxia, but not with any known sources of anthropogenic contamination. Among crabs from Tampa Bay (Florida) and the Houston (Texas) Ship Channel there was a negative correlation between the degree of industrialization and organic contaminants in the digestive gland and sediments and hemocyanin concentration. In the Houston Ship Channel decreased dissolved oxygen confounded the possible correlation with contaminants. In all areas sampled, lower concentrations of hemocyanin were not correlated with either the apparent health or sex of the crabs or with salinity.

AB  - The investigation of phytolith variations in plant-soil systems provides a good opportunity to quantitatively study taphonomic effects on phytoliths in soil, and evaluate their representation of the aboveground plant community. In this study, the assemblage and size variations of phytolith morphotypes in a bamboo (Dendrocalamus ronganensis) forest plant-soil system were analyzed to study how well soil phytoliths represent the overlying plant community and the taphonomic processes acting on phytoliths. Phytolith content and morphotype assemblages differed between organs of D. ronganensis. There were no apparent differences in phytolith morphotypes of components of the plant-soil system (fallen leaf, mold and soil). The phytolith assemblage of raw leaves showed a high positive correlation with soil-system samples. Compared to (June and January) raw leaves, fallen leaves exhibited decreased percentages of ACUTE BUIBOSUS, STOMA (Representativeness coefficient less than 1), and increased BUWFORM FIABELLATE, RONDEL and ELONGATE (R-values higher than 1). Soil phytolith morphologies were different due to phytolith dissolution in the soil. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on soil phytolith morphologies and assemblages should consider phytolith preservation and taphonomy in soils as well as sediments. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The energy transition has shown that fossil generation can be complemented with renewable energy and other resources capable of providing flexibility to the energy system's operation, in compliance with the wholesale electricity market's rules. This paper proposes a market-based methodology for introducing flexible demand in the energy dispatch, optimizing the scheduling of electricity system operation in the short-term, and considers the challenge of implementing an incentive scheme for participants in demand-response programs. The scheme includes the criteria of the elasticity of substitution and a renewable energy quota. This methodology is focused on a strategic demand shift to minimize the cost of supply; increase the dispatch of renewable energy; control CO2 emissions; and satisfy the generation, demand, and transmission operating constraints. These conditions encourage the development of a simulation tool that allows a sensitivity analysis to aid decision-making by operators and agents. The proposed methodology optimizes the operational cost of generation supply and specific performance indicators to determine the percentages of demand shift, the amount of CO2 emissions, the ratio of unserved power, the demand benefits obtained from an incentive scheme, and the natural market behavior.

AB  - The life cycle phase of fossil fuel extraction is mainly considered in the life cycle assessment (LCA) when evaluating the energy production processes. It is then only one of many unit processes, which contribute to the blurring of mining-relevant results. There are few items in the literature focusing exclusively on the lignite mining phase and analysing the specific mining conditions and associated environmental impacts. The article focuses on the LCA of lignite mining processes on the basis of data coming from a Polish mine. The technology for opencast lignite mining is noted for its high production efficiency, high level of recovery and lower risk as regards the safety of workers when compared with underground mining systems. However, the need to remove large amounts of overburden to uncover the deposit contributes to a much greater degradation of the landscape. Analysing the results obtained, several key (hot spot) elements of the lignite mining operations were distinguished for modelling the environmental impact, i.e.: calorific value, the amount of electricity consumption, the manner in which waste and overburden are managed. As a result there is a high sensitivity of the final indicator to changes in these impacts.

AB  - Seaports are major intermodal structures in the global supply chain, where multiple stakeholders search for profitable and resilient maritime lines. Shipowners reduce the distance between the northern and southern hemispheres by connecting hub ports. Hosting a global hub port implies competitive advantages to the municipality. However, operational bottlenecks loosen the port-city relationship. One of the main conflicts in this relation is the land port access, a hard-to-be-mapped, random operation. The traffic flow rise noticed in developed countries' ports and, more recently, in emerging markets, causes congestion and air pollutant emissions in terminal surroundings. Current models for road port access are static, single-window non-synchronized truck appointment systems. As a contribution, this case study develops a dynamic model of road port access. Also, it verifies the effectiveness of its application in the port-city relationship indicators in an emerging market global hub port, the Port of Santos, faced with ports of developed countries, prospecting optimal conditions to its implementation in an environment with significant institutional obstacles.

AB  - Petrographic, organic, and inorganic geochemical analysis of the solid bitumen and host shales from the Middle and Late Jurassic-age Sargelu and Naokelekan Formations of the Banik section, northernmost Iraq, was undertaken. The aim was to understand their derivation and preservation, as well as examine the carbon and oxygen isotopes, and paleoredox proxies under which the solid bitumen and host sediments were deposited. Petrographic analysis of both formations revealed the presence of solid bitumen high reflectance (first phase) and solid bitumen low reflectance (second phase). The equivalent vitrinite reflectance indicates that the solid bitumen of the two formations probably accumulated within the shale reservoirs following oil migration from source rocks located within the same formations. Mineralogical study (XRD and SEM - EDX) revealed that the shales hosting the solid bitumen also contain clay minerals (illite, rectorite, chlorite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite) as well as carbonate minerals, quartz, alkali feldspar, and pyrite. Carbon and oxygen isotope data along with paleoredox indicators suggest that both the solid bitumen sources and host shales in both formations formed within a shallow-marine setting, most probably under anoxic conditions where water circulation was restricted.

AB  - Soil structure conditions the interaction between the physical-hydraulic, chemical, and biological attributes and determines the potential of soil productivity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the structure of soils of areas subjected to soybean production and the impacts of soil structure on crop yield. In total, 28 soybean production areas were selected in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, and analyzed for particle size, soil organic carbon and aggregates. Data of soil attributes were subjected to descriptive analysis, Pearson's correlation and Kruskal-Wallis test at p <= 0.05. In general, considering the non-irrigated soybean production areas, it was found that soils with mean sand content between 100.00 and 800.10 g kg(-1) and clay content between 120.00 and 627.80 g kg(-1) showed average soybean yield of 3,536.36 kg ha(-1). Soils that had aggregates with mean weight diameter and mean geometric diameter above 1.50 mm showed soybean yield equal to or greater than 3,370.67 kg ha(-1). Soils of similar textural groups can define different levels of soybean yield, depending on characteristics such as the type of management adopted and production technology applied in the soybean production area.

AB  - In order to select and recommend the optimal parking lot for the users, a novel intelligent selection algorithm based on the grey relational analysis considering user preferences is proposed. The parking-lot evaluation index system consisting of indicators in effectiveness, convenience, economy, environmental attribute and agreeableness is firstly established. The comprehensive weight determination method combining the expert estimation method with the user preference settings is proposed to determine the comprehensive weight of each evaluation index, and this method can meet the personalized needs of individual user to the greatest extent. The evaluation indexes considering various representative objective and subjective influential factors including the driving distance between the current location and the target parking lot, the walking distance between the target parking lot and the destination, the remaining parking spaces, the parking fee, the condition of the hardware facilities and service quality are determined, and the corresponding comprehensive weight of each evaluation index is calculated. Then the parking lots near the destination are evaluated by the grey relational analysis in order to select the optimal one to the user for parking reservation. This algorithm has been proven to be effective by the APP on Android mobile phones.

AB  - Architectural design is a building system that has room composition and design products that take into account environmental conditions. The thing that most influences the environment and user comfort is lighting, where the more evenly distributed light in the room, the better the level of comfort. The importance of this lighting, so in designing, must think about the process of lighting quantitation in the room. One method of lighting quantitation in the room is the calculation of the Daylight Factor (DF). The value of DF is affected by Sky Component (SC). On the DF, the object used is a window and outside lighting factors. Based on the quantitation process, this research has the idea of analyzing three different variants of space in the character of the wall. In this paper, the best window position is obtained based on the value of the largest number of DF distributions in the room. Optimization in this study can be obtained by calculating the standard deviation value of the DF distribution for each window opening shift. The window position is considered optimal or the best in the DF distribution in the room, if it has the highest DF mean value and the smallest DF variant value.

AB  - In this experiment we studied the influence of chemical fertilizers on physiological indices and the amount of protein in two soybean varieties, Atlas and Hodgson. Researches has been carried out between 2017-2019 at Didactic Station of BUASMV Timiwara with different doses of chemical fertilizers. Observations and measurements were made on plant physiology and yield characteristics. The process of accumulation of dry substances in different organs of the plant during the vegetation period is dependent to the effectiveness of fertilization. The dynamics of the total water content in the plant and especially its modification under the influence of chemical fertilizers is of interest for the appreciation of the process of formation of dry substances, respectively of agricultural harvest. In both varieties between the experimental and the control variant, significant differences appeared in all followed indicators, the most favorable variant being N45P63K45. Superior results were registered at Atlas, better adapted to the ecological conditions of the reference area. Fertilizers are decisive factors in the increase of yield and the quantity of protein, although this plant has the capacity to supply some of the necessary nitrogen with bacterial symbionts. High doses of phosphorus did not produce higher yields compared to moderate ones.

AB  - The aim of this paper was the evaluation of the ecotoxic effects of three sulphonylurea compounds, commonly used as herbicides against weeds in agriculture by mathematical models. The tests were performed both in laboratory and field conditions to study the changes in soil urease, considered a key enzyme for regulating soil nitrogen transformation and a sensitive indicator to herbicides. Mathematical models accurately reproduced the behavior of urease from chemically treated soil samples, based on real, observable processes. Besides, they simplify the view regarding the activity of the selected enzyme, as there are many factors and complicated biogeochemical processes, which might interfere. Overall, we conclude that, for the cambic chernozem model analyzed here, the normal (label-recommended) chlorsulfuron and amidosulfuron doses do not perturb soil urease activity and the former compound is more urease-friendly than either amidosulfuron or tifensulfuron. In the context of the long-term use of these herbicides, our research underlines the importance of mathematical models and the prefiguration of a map for the differentiation of field / laboratory experiments, for the most accurate highlighting of the biochemical imbalances caused by the chemical substances, the risk of overdose and the toxicity risk for soil and environment.

AB  - Hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) is a toxic heavy metal that discharged by many industries into the water streams. It is the most toxic form of chromium compound, which causes significant damage to receiving ecosystems. A microalgal species, Chlorella sp., was used as a biosorbent material to remove Cr (VI) from Cr-contaminated effluents. Furthermore, different variables: pH, temperature, contact time, Cr (VI) concentration and algal dose, were optimized in order to determine the optimum conditions that achieve the highest removal efficiency. The optimization process was achieved through two steps: one factor at a time (OFAT) experiments followed by 2(5) general full factorial. Moreover, molecular identification was performed using 18S rRNA in order to demonstrate the species of Chlorella, and it was identified as Chlorella sorokiniana. The highest chromium removal efficiency of 99.6793% was achieved at 100 ppm Cr (VI) after three days' contact time. Chlorophyll `a' estimation as a growth indicator stated that Chlorella sorokiniana can tolerate 100 ppm Cr (VI) for three days' exposure. The results suggested that Chlorella sorokiniana is a good biosorbent material and it distinguished by its high ability to uptake Cr (VI) from solutions.

AB  - The paper discusses the possibilities of incorporating sensors and indicators into the environment of an Industry 4.0 digital factory. The concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is characterized via a brief description of the RAMI 4.0 and I4.0 component model. In this context, the article outlines the structure of an I4.0 production component, interpreting such an item as a body integrating the asset and its electronic form, namely, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). The formation of the AAS sub-models from the perspectives of identification, communication, configuration, safety, and condition monitoring is also described to complete the main analysis. Importantly, the authors utilize concrete use cases to demonstrate the roles of the given I4.0 component model and relevant SW technologies in creating the AAS. In this context, the use cases embody applications where an operator wearing a SmartJacket equipped with sensors and indicators ensures systematic data collection by passing through the manufacturing process. The set of collected information then enables the operator and the system server to monitor and intervene in the production cycle. The advantages and disadvantages of the individual scenarios are summarized to support relevant analysis of the entire problem.

AB  - Petrography and chemistry of minerals showing that Eocene alkaline volcanic rocks in southwestern of Germi (Talesh zone, NW Iran) mostly have basaltic composition. Mineralogically these rocks are composed of diopsidic clinopyroxene and labradoritic plagioclase phenocrysts. The microlithic and glassy groundmass composed of sanidine, clinopyroxene, biotite, pargasitic amphibole and magnetite associated with devitrified glass. Clinopyroxenes show relatively high Mg-numbers (0.76-0.93), low Al-VI (mostly <0.1), suggesting relatively low-pressure (similar to 5), and water content similar to 2.5 to less than 10% and high oxygen fugacity (-8.38-11.51) of crystallization condition. High amount existence of magnetite coexisting with amphibole and biotite mineral confirm high fugacity of the host magma. According to clinopyroxene and feldspar thermometry, estimated crystallization temperature varies between 1106 degrees C to similar to 1200 degrees C. The clinopyroxene and amphibole mineral composition of studied rocks indicate that they have been formed in a backarc basin environment. Mineral chemistry in the current zone shows that composition and genesis of common minerals these magmatic rocks are similar to Pushtasar basaltic rocks in the northern part of this area.

AB  - The environmental impact of heavy metal (Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Ni, Sr-90 and Cs-137) transport and transformation in the Hangzhou Bay (China) was assessed through a comprehensive model that integrates hydrodynamics, sediment and heavy metal transport. A mechanistic surface complexation model was used to estimate the adsorption and desorption of heavy metal by suspended sediment under different aqueous chemistry conditions. The dynamics of metal exchange to and from the seabed was also assessed. The primary processes regulating heavy metal distribution, i.e., convection-diffusion, adsorption-desorption, sedimentation-resuspension, as well as other physical and chemical processes related to mass exchange between adjacent sediment layers, were considered in detail. The accidental discharge of Cs-137 was simulated as an example and results showed that Cs-137 transported along the coast driven by tidal flow. Most Cs-137 distributed near the outfall and accumulated in the seabed sediment. The proposed model can be a useful tool for predicting heavy metal transport and fate and provide a theoretical basis to guide field sampling, assessment of risks and the design of remediation strategies.

AB  - Facial mimicry has been suggested to be a behavioral index for emotional empathy. The present study is the first to investigate the link between facial muscle activity and empathy for pain by facial electromyographic (EMG) recording while observers watched videos depicting real-life painful events. Three types of visual stimulus were used: an intact painful scene and arm-only (needle injection) and face only (painful expression) scenes. Enhanced EMG activity of the corrugator supercilii (CS) and zygomaticus major (ZM) muscles was found when observers viewed others in pain, supporting a unique pain expression that is distinct from the expression of basic emotions. In the intact video stimulus condition, CS activity was correlated positively with the empathic concern score and ZM activity, suggesting facial mimicry mediated empathy for pain. Cluster analysis of facial EMG responses revealed markedly different patterns among stimulus types, including response category, ratio, and temporal dynamics, indicating greater ecological validity of the intact scene in eliciting pain empathy as compared with partial scenes. This study is the first to quantitatively describe pain empathy in terms of facial EMG data. It may provide important evidence for facial mimicry as a behavioral indicator of pain empathy.

AB  - With an ever increasing population, biological wastewater treatment process has a crucial importance in the world. Activated sludge can be defined as a microbial community and consists of free, flocculated and filamentous bacteria, protozoa, rotifers and other invertebrates. Many studies on the relationships between protozoa and physicochemical and operational parameters have showed that species of these communities represent an important indicator of the wastewater treatment process efficiency. At a certain concentration, heavy metals and other pollutants are toxic to most microorganisms. The protozoa community is represented by interacting organisms, including species that are sensitive, intermediate or resistant in their tolerance to pollutants. The focus of the research was to determine the effect of 3 metals (copper, chromium and zinc) on the activated sludge viability. Experiments were conducted in a continuous flow bioreactor (simulating the conditions of a WWTP) fed with real wastewater and inoculated with activated sludge obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant. Microscopic determinations were used to evaluate the diversity and dynamics of the activated sludge biocenosis community. The study emphasised that all three metals had a more or less impact on the protozoa community highlighting both the most sensitive and the most resistant species.

AB  - This study presents a global analysis of urban water supply vulnerability in 71 surface-water supplied cities, with populations exceeding 750 000 and lacking source water diversity. Vulnerability represents the failure of an urban supply-basin to simultaneously meet demands from human, environmental and agricultural users. We assess a baseline (2010) condition and a future scenario (2040) that considers increased demand from urban population growth and projected agricultural demand. We do not account for climate change, which can potentially exacerbate or reduce urban supply vulnerability. In 2010, 35% of large cities are vulnerable as they compete with agricultural users. By 2040, without additional measures 45% of cities are vulnerable due to increased agricultural and urban demands. Of the vulnerable cities in 2040, the majority are river-supplied with mean flows so low (1200 liters per person per day, l/p/d) that the cities experience 'chronic water scarcity' (1370 l/p/d). Reservoirs supply the majority of cities facing individual future threats, revealing that constructed storage potentially provides tenuous water security. In 2040, of the 32 vulnerable cities, 14 would reduce their vulnerability via reallocating water by reducing environmental flows, and 16 would similarly benefit by transferring water from irrigated agriculture. Approximately half remain vulnerable under either potential remedy.

AB  - Pollen analysis of Middle Pleistocene sediments from the Yangtze Delta Plain provides a paleoecological reconstruction and has implications for stratigraphic correlation in East China. The pollen assemblage is characterized by high values of Fagus (16.8% on average), which is unusual because Fagus is generally present only sporadically in other lowland Quaternary pollen records from the region. In addition to Fagus, the assemblage has a rich diversity of broad-leaved deciduous trees, including Quercus, Ulmus, Carpinus/Ostrya, Juglans, Betula, and Liquidambar, as well as conifers, including Pinus, Picea, Abies, Larix, and Tsuga. Thus, the pollen flora suggests a broad-leaved deciduous forest mixed with abundant conifers, which developed under cooler and more humid conditions than present. The stable pollen sequence throughout the studied section suggests a stable environment. Beech forests also characterize the Middle Pleistocene of Taiwan and Japan, and thus may be a stratigraphic indicator of the Middle Pleistocene in East Asia. The Yangtze Delta Plain may have been an important refugium for the last survival of Fagus in the lowlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Efforts were made to evaluate the source of enterococci levels at a recreational beach. Four monitoring efforts were implemented which included tidal studies, hourly sampling, runoff sampling, and spatially intensive sediment sampling. Spatially intensive sediment sampling indicated that enterococci concentrations consistently decreased away from the inter-tidal zone, both seaward and landward. During dry conditions, the highest concentrations in the water were observed during high tide (71 +/- 48 CFU/100 mL) and lower concentrations were observed during low tide (4 +/- 3 CFU/100 mL). Runoff was characterised by very high levels (11,700 CFU/100 mL). Results from these monitoring efforts collectively showed that the source of enterococci to the study beach is geographically located within the inter-tidal zone. Wash-in from the inter-tidal zone through tidal action and runoff plays a major role in controlling enterococci levels within the water column. Such results are significant in identifying the source and transport mechanisms of enterococci, which can subsequently be used as part of a modelling effort aimed at predicting enterococci levels at recreational beaches.

AB  - A peat-sequence covering the last 16 ka (16 000 cal. yr BP) from Braamhoek wetland, eastern South Africa, was analysed in terms of phytolith and diatom composition. The fossil peat was rich in phytoliths, while diatoms were less prominent, probably as a result of degradation during wetland plant growth associated with silica uptake. With this study we present the first continuous phytolith and diatom record from South Africa covering the Late Pleistocene and Holocene period. The phytolith assemblages indicate a clear dominance of C-3-grasses within the wetland throughout the sequence. The fossil diatom record infer changes in past moisture conditions. Unlike the modern wetland, which is dominated by benthic and aerophilic diatoms, the Late Pleistocene-early Holocene wetland favoured growth of planktonic species. Abundance of planktonic diatoms suggests three main phases when water depth was deeper than today; at c. 13.6 ka, 11.3 ka and 10.4-10.0 ka. These indications of past fluctuations in humidity mostly provide confirmation of previously published indications of pollen, charcoal fragments and isotopes in the same core, but the siliceous microfossil data also help to refine the paleo-environmental interpretation of the sequence.

AB  - Significant environmental benefits are claimed for local food systems, but these biophysical indicators are increasingly recognised as inadequate descriptors of supply chain ethics. Social factors such as health are also important indicators of good practice, and are recognised by the organic and local food movements as important to the development of rounded sustainable agricultural practices. This study compared the self-reported health status of farm workers in the United Kingdom, Spain, Kenya and Uganda who were supplying distant markets with fresh vegetables. Workers on Kenyan export horticulture farms reported significantly higher levels of physical health than did Kenyan non-export farm workers and workers in the other study countries. Mean health levels for farm workers in the United Kingdom were significantly lower than relevant population norms, indicating widespread levels of poor health amongst these workers. These results suggest that globalised supply chains can provide social benefits to workers, while local food systems do not always provide desirable social outcomes. The causal mechanisms of these observations probably relate more to the social conditions of workers than directly to income. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since conjunctive water use for agriculture is turning out to be a major environmental challenge in some river basins. there is all urgent need to quantify future water availability and water demand to identify whether there is a surplus or deficit of water. This is of great importance in developing water management plans for a basin or a state. In this paper. the Basin-wide Holistic Integrated Water Assessment (BHIWA) model developed at the International Commission oil Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) was used in all attempt to simulate the water balance of the study basin. the Qiantang River basin in China, as well as to analyse the impacts of land and water use on return flows Of this basin, The model was run on a monthly basis, and was calibrated by comparing the calculated and observed data. Furthermore. the BHIWA model was applied to Simulate historic conditions of the basin dating back to 1980 and for future scenarios to analyse the effects of water policies and multiple demands oil water resources. The results calculated from this model indicated how the model could be a useful tool for basin-level integrated water assessment. particularly in small river basins.

AB  - Ciscoes Coregonus artedi are coldwater stenotherms that are sensitive indicators of ecological stressors, such as eutrophication and climate warming, that reduce coldwater habitat. Temperature and oxygen profile data were collected during cisco mortality events at 17 lakes during an unusually warm summer in Minnesota in 2006. Combinations of temperature and oxygen from the profiles were mapped onto a two-dimensional niche space to directly quantify an oxythermal lethal niche boundary for ciscoes. Quantile regression was used to estimate the niche boundary that described lethal combinations of oxygen and temperature for cisco. The fitted lethal oxythermal niche boundary exhibited a curvilinear interaction between lethal temperatures and lethal oxygen concentrations. The lethal temperature under normoxia (about 8 mg/L) was estimated to be 24 degrees C. Lethal temperatures were progressively less at lower lethal oxygen concentrations (e.g., the lethal temperature was 23.0 degrees C at 5.0 mg/L, 22.0 degrees C at 3.0 mg/L, and 19.5 degrees C at 1.0 mg/L). The lethal oxythermal niche boundary provides a basis for quantifying coldwater cisco habitat under current and future climate warming and water quality conditions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize and compare the floristic composition of eight fragments of Calcareous Dry Forest and Arboreal Caatinga in the north of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The survey of the tree species was performed by periodic visits to the fragments. We found 114 tree species belonging to 40 botanical families in the eight fragments. Of a total of 89 species found in the Calcareous Dry Forest fragments, 37 (42%) were typical of this formation. On the other hand, from the 75 species sampled in the Arboreal Caatinga remnants, 25 species (33%) occurred only in these fragments. The cluster analysis suggested that the floristic composition of the fragments was affected by the phytophysiognomy and by local bioecological conditions. The observed relationship between remnant area and tree species richness suggests that area was a good indicator of species richness in the forest fragments. The results of this study indicate that both historical (phytophysiognomy) and ecological (e. g., remnant area and occurrence of human disturbance) factors constitute important elements that determine the composition and richness of tree species of forest fragments in the north of Minas Gerais State.

AB  - Charophytes constitute a group of macrophytes that usually inhabit soft bottoms with shallow water. They occur mostly in fresh-water environments but can also be found in brackish waters. Due to their requirement for clear water they are considered sensitive to eutrophication and therefore often used as an indicator for good water quality. The diverse structure of the Estonian coastline with its numerous sheltered bays and shallow, soft-bottom archipelago areas coupled with low salinity conditions provides an excellent habitat for charophytes. To date, seven species have been described in Estonian coastal waters, NE Baltic Sea. Last systematic investigations on charophyte distribution date back 20-30 years. During the summer of 2001 the locations where charophytes have previously been found were revisited and new sites sampled, to describe the present distribution of quantitative and qualitative parameters of charophyte species. Sampling was performed mainly by SCUBA diving: occurrence, abundance and wet weight biomass were estimated for each location. Six species of charophytes were identified. Compared to previously recorded material, no significant changes in the distribution pattern of charophytes were found. The dependence of charophyte distribution on environmental settings was tested, with depth and substrate quality explaining most of the variability in distribution. Salinity within observed range had minor influence on charophytes.

AB  - A National Pilot Project (NPP) on Livestock and the Environment was initiated in 1992 to help provide solutions to environmental problems associated with livestock production. A major development of the NPP was the Comprehensive Economic and Environmental Optimization Tool-Livestock and Poultry (CEEOT-LP), an integrated modeling system designed to produce economic and environmental indicators for alternative policy scenarios applied to intensive livestock production watersheds. The system consists of a farm-level economic model (FEM) and two environmental models: the field-scale APEX model and the watershed-level SWAT model. To date, CEEOT-LP has been applied to two watersheds in Texas and one in Iowa. Predicted reductions in P losses for two P-based manure application rate scenarios, relative to baseline conditions, ranged from -4 to -54 percent across the three watersheds; however, N loss impacts ranged from a decrease of 34 percent to an increase of 79 percent. For five other alternative scenarios that were simulated for only one watershed, N and P loss impacts ranged between a reduction of 78 percent to an increase of 20 percent. Aggregate watershed-level economic impacts of the seven scenarios spanned a spectrum of a 27 percent decrease to a 25 percent increase in profit, relative to the baseline.

AB  - Over the past 50 years, treatment possibilities in psychiatry have drastically improved, but the results we actually achieve under everyday treatment conditions fall far short of what could be accomplished. Quality management represents a suitable method of reducing this gap. Although it has been successfully practiced in other medical disciplines for a long time, its implementation in psychiatry has previously been restricted to pilot projects, Quality management programs in psychiatry have been slow to be accepted because, up to now, only a few mental health professionals have received training in quality management techniques, In order to compensate for this information deficit and to familiarize psychiatrists and other mental health care workers with this increasingly important topic, we will provide in this paper a brief survey of the most important principles and techniques of quality management, This information should encourage psychiatrists to apply this new method to their own areas of responsibility, The results of one of our own studies on schizophrenic outpatients, which are presented at the end of the paper, are intended to show that the outcome can be improved and costs reduced by implementing quality management programs in psychiatry.

AB  - Arthropod fossils from Quaternary deposits in Greenland are considered. The few occurrences of Early and Middle Pleistocene age have yielded only three species of barnacles. This contrasts sharply with the last interglacial stage which is represented by many sites, from which a range of marine, lacustrine and terrestrial crustaceans and insects are reported. The only secure late glacial sediments from Greenland are found in the far south, and only a few taxa of arthropods have so far been identified from these. The best dated and richest faunas come from the Holocene. Most records of insects are from the late Holocene, but there are also a number of finds from the early and mid Holocene. Arthropods are considered good palaeoclimate indicators, because they are generally dispersed quicker, for example, than vascular plants. This group of animals is also highly useful for reconstructing former ecological conditions, because they occupy such a wide range of biotopes. A total of about 105 taxa have been reported so far, but several groups of arthropods, such as marine ostracodes, chironomids and oribatids, have received little attention, and many more taxa can be expected when these groups are being studied in the future.

AB  - The toxic effects of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) on several planktonic freshwater organisms were studied over a 5-d period using small in situ enclosures. The experimental setup, an unreplicated regression design, made it possible to calculate no effect concentrations (NEC), an environmental risk assessment. The NEC varied several orders of magnitude between the different groups of organisms, with ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates being the most sensitive groups (NEC as low as 0.02 mg LAS/L). The high sensitivity of the protozoans makes their exclusion from most ecotoxicological studies questionable, and this must be reconsidered in the future. Most other planktonic organisms were only affected at concentrations higher than normally found in aquatic habitats. Exceptions to this general trend were the photosynthetic activity of the phytoplankton and cryptophyte abundance, which both were nearly as sensitive parameters as the protozoan abundance. The toxicity of LAS was generally higher in the present investigation, compared with the vast majority of laboratory-derived results, indicating a limited relevance of the latter and the need fur field experiments in order to determine impacts of xenobiotics in the aquatic environments.

T2  - GEOKHIMIYA
LA  - Russian
AB  - The first data on the composition of P-2-T-1 volcanic rocks penetrated (within the depth interval from 6424 to 7502 m) by Superdeep Hole SG-6, Urengoi District on the Western Siberian Platform, are reported. Data on the petrography, chemistry, and trace-element distribution indicate that the volcanic pile is dominated by low-potassium tholeiitic basalts, which are comparable with the coeval low-potassium Archean flood tholeiites of the Siberian Platform (in the Norilsk and Maimecha-Kotui provinces). The fact that the low-potassium tholeiites are spatially restricted to the junction zone between ancient and young platforms makes it possible to develop and notably extend the paleogeodynamic evolutionary model for the junction zone, if the P-2-T-1 volcanism is regarded as a manifestation of intercontinental fissure-type volcanism. Specific secondary alterations (low-temperature hydration and laterite-type leaching) in the buried volcanic rocks caused their good reservoir properties with respect to hydrocarbons. The P-T conditions of the origin and localization of low-potassium basalts on continents and in spreading zones are discussed as important data useful in predicting Cu-Ni mineralization and deep-seated reserves of hydrocarbons related to intracontinental fissure magmatism.

AB  - A child with manifestations of acrogeria and metageria, two "premature aging" syndromes, is presented. Because of his indistinct phenotype and because the question has been previously raised as to whether these conditions are separate, we propose the designation of acrometageria to describe this phenotypic continuum. As there is much in common clinically between acrometageria and the syndrome of type III procollagen deficiency (Ehlers-Danlos type IV), it might be presumed that a similar pathogenesis for acrometageria exists. This possibility has been tested previously, without demonstrating specific quantititative or qualitative deficits, but with some indirect evidence that collagen metabolism is deranged in these patients. One such crude indicator is the elevation of urinary hyaluronic acid levels, demonstrated in our patient and also observed in the phenotypically distinct Werner and Hutchinson-Gilford premature aging syndromes. On one hand, it could be argued that this supports the concept that premature aging syndromes exist as a biological continuum. On the other hand, it is equally valid to argue that syndromes of premature aging are so described merely because they include recognizable changes of normal aging and that the demonstration of an underlying mutation in a collagen gene, for example, invalidates their study as models of accelerated normal aging.

AB  - Significant bromine (Br) isotope composition variations are found in natural salts and brines, which are often even larger than those of co-existing chlorine isotope compositions. The cause of such large Br isotope variations remains elusive. In this study, equilibrium Br isotope fractionations among Br-bearing gaseous molecules, aqueous species and crystalline minerals are provided via the density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations. These fractionation factors form the base for future Br isotope geochemistry studies. Specifically, the first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) method is used to evaluate the tricky solvation effects, i.e., dozens of snapshots of FPMD trajectories are selected and reoptimized to their lowest energy atomic coordinates, then the reduced partition function ratios (i.e., beta factors) of aqueous Br-bearing species are obtained by computing the average values of those snapshots. In this way, the configurational effects of aqueous Br-bearing species are included. For crystalline compounds, the static first-principles periodic DFT methods are used. We find that the beta factors generally increase as the oxidation states of Br increase, indicating that heavy Br isotopes tend to be enriched in substances with higher Br oxidation states. The aqueous Br-bearing species in brines have detectable but small Br isotope fractionations with each other. However, the fractionations between gaseous molecules and NaBr( (aq)) are significantly larger, e.g., Delta(BrCH3Br)-Br-81(g(as))- NaBr((aq)) is 0.95 +/- 0.041% at 20 degrees C. As for minerals, the fractionation between Br-halite((p)) (pure NaBr crystal) and NaBr( aq) is close to zero, but for Br-halite( (1/124)) (Na125Cl124Br1) and NaBr((aq)), the fractionation is 0.206 +/- 0.041%. Similar results are found for the fractionations between Br-sylvite, Br-bischofite and Br-bearing solutions, indicating that Br isotope compositions are closely related to Br/Cl ratios in minerals. By using the calculated isotope fractionation factors, we have modeled the Br isotope composition variations during salt precipitation processes. At 20 degrees C, the total variations of Br isotopes of salts and brines are found to be -0.45% to +0.21% and -0.39% to 0%, respectively. They are much smaller than the observed Br isotope variations in natural samples. There must be other ways to fractionate Br isotopes to the extent that observed in nature. Based on the predicted equilibrium Br isotope fractionations among substances with different Br oxidation states, the large Br isotope variations in nature can be explained by the change of Br oxidation state. The sudden change of Br isotope compositions hence can be used as a new indicator for the change of redox conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article deals with the problem of ethnic and cultural interaction of the Siberian population in the Colonization Epoch, the urgency of which is determined by the fact, that the process of region's entering into Russia radically changed the development vector and the historical perspectives of indigenous peoples and settlers, who eventually became Russian Siberians. The aim of the study is to show, that the peoples' contacts were by no means confined to the political-administrative-legal field, which is primarily reflected in written sources, but were in the space of non-political everyday life and were conducted in the language of material culture as well. Cultural exchange at the economic and household level is transformed into an effective mechanism of adaptation to the changed conditions of existence for both local and foreign peoples. The source base for the study of ethnic and cultural interaction is multicomponent and includes written documents, folklore, archaeological data, in which the historical reality is differently refracted that allows more complete reconstruction of the past realities. Interethnic communication involves different layers of culture, influences and borrowings that occur at different speeds and in different volume, drawn-in cultures of different stages that assume the presence of a donor culture and a recipient culture, the exchange between those is asymmetric. In one space-time continuum representatives of different cultural worlds communicate in verbal language and in the language of material things, objects, symbols, which is reflected in the archaeological context. The massive presence in indigenous sites of "Russian" importation items requires a deeper historical interpretation, which goes beyond the statement of just a fact of the interaction and simplistic interpretations of the archaeological context. The study of the Russian sites' materials shows, that ideas about the Russian culture itself need improvement or revision in some aspects, especially taking into account the impact of the native environment. Was the introduction into everyday life and even into the sacred space of culture of "alien" elements up to the complete replacement of local products with imported ones in the funerary inventory, traditional costume with purchased clothes etc. an indisputable indicator of "Russification" or "Christianization"? Transformation and even deformation of identities as a form of adaptation to changing living conditions did not lead the participants of interethnic communication to the loss of their "selves". The analysis of the criteria, forms, mechanisms of self-preservation in the "melting pot" of ethnic and cultural interaction is far from completion. The study leads to the conclusion, that the solution of the problem is not only in the field of source base strengthening, but also is in a methodological and methodical analysis of the interaction process, dynamics and depth of transformation of the initial state of culture.

AB  - The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian transitional sequence in the Mussoorie and Garhwal Hills of the Lesser Himalaya is represented by dolomites of the Upper Krol Formation and chert-phosphorite assemblages of the lowermost Tal Formation. These rocks provide valuable information regarding the assumed existence of a stratified ocean during the terminal Neoproterozoic and beginning of earliest Cambrian (Nemakit-Daldynian). The isotopic compositions of carbonate and organic carbon in the transition profile can be best interpreted as reflecting an oceanic anoxic event (OAE) prior to the phase of early Cambrian phosphate formation. The chert-phosphorite beds record negative Ce and positive Eu anomalies. While Ce is an important paleooceanic redox indicator, Eu is rather immobile under normal diagenetic conditions. The observed Eu anomaly is linked to the high Ba content in these phosphorites and is indicative of an anoxic (or sulfate reducing) diagenetic environment. The suggested stratification of the ocean during the Late Neoproterozoic and Nemakit-Daldynian times would have been Linked to the reduction of oxygen supply to the zone below the redoxcline, causing C-12-and P-rich organic matter previously produced in the photic zone to be trapped in large quantities within the deeper anoxic zone. This would, in turn, increase the C-13 content of the water in the photic zone. Moreover, in the deeper anoxic waters, reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ would result in an enrichment of dissolved Ce (as Ce3+). Upwelling of this anoxic bottom stratum would bring the C-12-and Ce-enriched waters back to the oxic marine realm. However, on entering the highly oxic productive zone, the excess Ce is expected to be removed from the water by oxidation to insoluble Ce4+ followed by precipitation or preferential scavenging. Due to these oxidation reactions, the waters of the shallow oxic zone would tend to become rapidly depleted in Ce. In other words, ocean mixing and upwelling during the early Cambrian were ultimately responsible for the transport of C-12, P and Ce to the oxic shelves. Sharp drops in both delta(13)C(carb) and delta(13)C(org) support the existence of oceanic anoxia followed by oceanic mixing at this juncture of Earth history. The large spread of the delta(34)S values of early diagenetic pyrites within the phosphorite bearing sequence in contrast to the limited spread of delta(13)C(carb) values suggests that phosphatisation took place under exclusively suboxic diagenetic non-sulfate reducing condition and pyritisation began only when phosphate layers entered the zone of sulfate reduction.

AB  - Objective Athletic performances are dynamic movements that are physically challenging and often predict individual success in ecological contexts. They stem from a complex integration of multiple phenotypic traits-e.g., morphological, physiological and behavioural-that dictate animal survival and individual fitness. However, directly quantifying athletic performances can be particularly challenging in cryptic, slow-moving species or not very reactive in attitude. Here we present and describe a rapid, simple, and low-cost method to measure athletic performance in post-metamorphic individuals of the fire salamander Salamandra salamandra. While extremely reactive during the larval stage, adult salamanders are, in fact, cryptic and relatively slow-moving. Results Forcing terrestrial juveniles to swim under standard, albeit ecologically plausible, laboratory conditions, and using an automatic point-mass tracking tool, we were able to measure maximal and average performance indicators of post-metamorphic individuals. This method avoids inter-individual variation in motivation, as it forces individuals to perform at their best. Moreover, with this method, measures of athletic performance will be directly comparable between larval and terrestrial stages, allowing to study the contribution of carryover effects to the wide range of processes implicated in the eco-evo-devo of athletic performance in salamanders.

AB  - This article explores the relationship between institutional environments and individual artists' artistic creativity to provide an understanding of the 'creative city', using urban sculpture planning in Shanghai as a case study. I argue that political censorship alone will not stifle artist's creativity: when authoritarian power interacts with elite social networks and permits a certain form of market economy, artistic creativity becomes concentrated on the technical aspects of artistic representation and can be channeled towards utilitarian projects in service of the community and the creative economy. A less open or tolerant institutional setting results in a type of 'structured creativity'-this refers to novel ideas and artistic expressions that emerge in the process of seeking valuable alternative outlets when facing political constraints. 'Structured creativity' characterizes the 'creative city' in countries such as China. The implication is that such 'structured creativity' contributes to the economy in terms of traditional statistical indicators, but is problematic in other ways. Richard Florida's 'creative city' thesis simplified the relationship between social conditions, creativity and economy; similarly, the complexity of this relationship has been overlooked in the critical literature about this topic.

AB  - Rotating machinery is used at length in a variety of industrial applications. The continuous monitoring of rotating machines is of excessive importance when it comes to prevent their catastrophic breakdown and the subsequent economic losses. This article proposes a novel health indicator to assess the performance degradation of two crucial rotating machinery components, namely rolling element bearings and gears. The potential of the proposed health indicator is demonstrated through experimental vibration signals acquired from several benchmark bearing and gear test rigs. The complexity measure, called as multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFEn), is extracted as a fault feature from the vibration signals. These MFEn feature vectors form probability distributions, the nature of which varies as the degradation in bearings or gears progresses. Then, the Jensen-Renyi divergence technique is applied, which discriminates the probability distribution of degraded multiscale entropy (MSE) feature vectors against the healthy MSE feature vectors to formulate the desired health indicator. Experimental results verify that the developed health indicator efficiently tracks the development of deterioration in rotary equipment and outperforms the conventional indicators, such as the root-mean-square value and kurtosis.

AB  - Pesticide spray drift poses health hazards to humans and causes a significant impact on the environment. In this work the capacity of an ad hoc light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system to differentiate spray nozzles according to their potential drift risk is evaluated for the first time. A total of 23 drift potential tests using 10 hollow-cone nozzles were carried out with the sprayer kept in a static position. Drift potential reduction (DPR) values of between 88.6% and 93.6% were obtained when comparing standard and drift reduction nozzle types. It was also possible to order different standard nozzle sizes according to their DPR. The LiDAR signal was correlated with several droplet size parameters measured by a phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA), being V-100 the best indicator. In the four field tests that were performed, the LiDAR system was also able to differentiate between standard and drift reduction nozzles under real application conditions, obtaining a DPR of 56.7%. The results of this work demonstrate that the developed LiDAR system is an advantageous alternative for the assessment of drift potential reduction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tumor hypoxia is the low tissue oxygen levels seen characteristically in rapidly proliferating and expanding neoplasms. It affects both malignant tumor cells and its microenvironment, resulting in dysfunctional neovascularization. This leads to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, facilitating tumor progression through cell mobility, invasion, and metastasis. The hypoxic condition in solid tumors is thus an indicator of the process of cancer progression towards an aggressive malignant phenotype with an enhanced possibility of metastasis and resistance to treatment. Advancements in the detection of tumor hypoxia and its utilization as a treatment modality in solid tumors are highly imperative. The use of fluorescent probes is an evolving field for detecting hypoxic tumors in biological systems. The present review is an attempt to provide a contextual knowledge on the prominent role of tumor hypoxia in cancer progression and dissemination. The use of azodyes in detecting tumor hypoxia aiding in cancer diagnosis through fluorescence off-on imaging and azodye-based hypoxia selective pro-drugs for assisting cancer therapy are presented. The limitations of fluorescence based hypoxia imaging and further investigations desired for clinical usage of azodye based hypoxic probes for fluorescence imaging are also considered.

AB  - The molecular structure of humus substances from permafrost-affected peat mounds of the East European forest-tundra has been studied with the use of up to date physicochemical methods (C-13 NMR, EPR spectroscopy). The structural-functional parameters of humus substances from these soils are specified by the integral action of cryogenic processes in the active layer, natural selection of aromatic structures in the course of humification, and by the species composition and degree of peat decomposition; they reflect the climatic conditions of peat formation in the Holocene. Humic acids of peat bogs are represented by low-condensed molecular structures with the low portion of carbon atoms of aromatic components, which increases down the soil profile, and by with the high content of non-oxidized aliphatic fragments. Active changes in the portions of aromatic and non-oxidized aliphatic fragments take place at the lower boundary of the active layer in the soils of bare peat spots. Such changes may serve as the basis for further search of the bioindicators of recent climate changes.

AB  - In recent years, the growing dynamics of the investments for new civil and industrial construction projects involves new properties acquisitions. On the other hand, there is an increase in the conversion of some industrial sites into commercial or residential areas, after their acquisition by the new owners. It is very important to knows the quality of the environmental components in the areas where the new investment projects are being implemented. Most of the time, the acquisition of a land or industrial site is preceded and, in many cases, conditioned by a thorough assessment of the quality of the environmental components in order to assume responsibilities for the ensuing environmental obligations. This involve environmental assessment performed by specialists who can objectively and analyze relevant environmental issues and report the necessary conclusions and recommendations for each case. The paper presents the expertise of the National Research and Development Institute for Industrial Ecology specialists in a study that analyzed soil, groundwater and air quality in order to develop new investments projects. The presented conclusions converge towards the important role of the environmental assessment based on the relevant information analyzed for each case and the importance of environmental information in preparing new investments.

AB  - Dairy products are a key source of valuable proteins and fats for many millions of people worldwide. Dairy cattle are highly susceptible to heat-stress induced decline in milk production, and as the frequency and duration of heat-stress events increases, the long term security of nutrition from dairy products is threatened. Identification of dairy cattle more tolerant of heat stress conditions would be an important progression towards breeding better adapted dairy herds to future climates. Breeding for heat tolerance could be accelerated with genomic selection, using genome wide DNA markers that predict tolerance to heat stress. Here we demonstrate the value of genomic predictions for heat tolerance in cohorts of Holstein cows predicted to be heat tolerant and heat susceptible using controlled-climate chambers simulating a moderate heatwave event. Not only was the heat challenge stimulated decline in milk production less in cows genomically predicted to be heat-tolerant, physiological indicators such as rectal and intra-vaginal temperatures had reduced increases over the 4 day heat challenge. This demonstrates that genomic selection for heat tolerance in dairy cattle is a step towards securing a valuable source of nutrition and improving animal welfare facing a future with predicted increases in heat stress events.

AB  - In order to demonstrate the influence of geographic location of a sampling site, land cover and calendar month on the expression of thirteen indirect indicators of surface meteorology and solar radiation, the technique of information re-scaling was applied based on latitude in order to calculate the zenith angle in coordinated pairs, in coniferous forests in Mexico. This historical series of information covers a period of 22 years of daily records. Ten sampling sites were defined in five geographical localities with two absolute land covers (natural forest and deforested) with a common spatial border; this neighboring condition was mandatory for the study. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0.05), for land cover, sampling site and calendar month. In the expression of the indices, an apparent latitudinal effect was observed of proximity to the coastline, which seems to suggest its influence on the evaluated indexes. The results suggest the extension of the database to include direct information pertaining to meteorology (wind speed and direction) and solar radiation. These data are necessary in order to characterize the response of the land cover for spectral invariance according to variations in the radiant flow, for the ratio of reflectance, absorbance and transmittance.

AB  - Measurement of health indicators in the blood is a commonly performed diagnostic procedure. Two blood studies one involving extended observations on the health of an individual by integrative Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP), and the other tracking the impact of Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) placement on nine heart failure patients were examined for the association of change in health status with change in microbial RNA species. Decrease in RNA expression ratios of human to bacteria and viruses accompanying deteriorated conditions was evident in both studies. Despite large between-subject variations in bacterial composition before LVAD implantation among all the patients, on day 180 after the implantation they manifested apparent between-subject bacterial similarity. In the iPOP study three periods, namely, pre-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection with normal blood glucose level, RSV infection with normal blood glucose level, and post-RSV infection with high blood glucose level could be defined. The upsurge of Enterobacteria phage PhiX 174 sensu lato and Escherichia coli gene expression, in which membrane transporters, membrane receptors for environment signalling, carbohydrate catabolic genes and carbohydrate-active enzymes were enriched only throughout the second period, which suggests a potentially overlooked microbial response to or modulation of the host blood glucose level.

AB  - The characterization of the effects of fragmentation is an essential starting point to enable the planning of the restoration of extensive fragmented areas. Thus, the work was conducted in order to characterize the main aspects of forest fragmentation on the river basin Poxim-SE, checking their possible effects through quantitative analysis of landscape structure. For this purpose, landscape indicators were used (metric), selected from the options of the program Patch Analyst 5.0. Georeferenced points were defined in the area, to relate the data collected by metrics with the information in the field. The analysis of metrics indicated that 85% of the fragments are small. All the fragments of the area have irregular shapes and high degree of insulation, with average distance of 657.3 m. In the simulation of an edge area of 35 m, the total area would be reduced by 32% with the exclusion of 28 fragments that were completely under this condition. The information in field is in accordance with the indicators of intense anthropic action, which leads to fragmentation of the area. The effects of fragmentation are evident in the river basin Poxim and planning goals for biodiversity conservation are needed to reduce the human action in this area.

AB  - The MO.NA.CO. project has been set up to evaluate the effectiveness of some GAECs (Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions) through the institution of a monitoring network throughout the Italian territory. The present work deals with the evaluation of the Standard 4.2c, concerning biomass and biodiversity in set-asides, in relation to fauna conservation. Monitoring was performed in three areas, using the following indicators: ground-dwelling Arthropods identified at the order level, Coleoptera identified at the family level and Lacertids. Our results seem to indicate that a mild management of set-asides, consisting in mowing once a year (mid July in the examined areas), may enhance faunal diversity, above all Arthropod diversity. After mowing, the set-asides managed following Standard 4.2, hosted higher levels of Arthropod diversity and a more balanced faunistic composition in comparison to unmoved set-asides and arable lands. On the contrary, we did not find significant effects of mowing on lizard abundance. We also discussed some measures to mitigate the negative direct effects of mechanical mowing on fauna.

AB  - Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is undertaken in more than 60 countries worldwide. Support to the SEA process can range from formal legal requirements to voluntary 'ad hoc' approaches. In the cases where SEA is legally required, such as in Europe where the SEA Directive sets a framework for SEA legislation in 28 countries, practitioners may engage with SEA but in a reluctant way. This paper reports on a unique survey of 203 key people responsible for implementing the SEA legislative requirement in Scotland. The majority (53%) of the 187 practitioners who answered the hypothetical question 'If SEA was not compulsory, would you do it?' said 'Yes'. However, results suggest that the responses were much nuanced. Practitioners were asked to explicate their reasoning and, irrespective of whether the answer was 'yes' or 'no', common themes were evident in accompanying remarks. This paper enables reflection on reasons for acceptance or rejection of the SEA process by discussing: the perception that a similar process to SEA is already being done, the problem with lack of resources, the call for a 'leaner process' and the difficulties of undertaking SEA when conditions are already determined at a higher 'tier'.

AB  - The strain Lactobacillus plantarum DM5 was isolated from fermented beverage Marcha of Sikkim and explored for its antagonistic activity against food-borne pathogens. The cell-free supernatant of L. plantarum DM5 showed antibacterial activity of 6,400 AU/mL in MRS medium (pH 6.0) against the indicator strain Staphylococcus aureus. MRS medium supplemented with 15 g/L of maltose at 37 degrees C under static condition yielded highest antimicrobial activity (6,400 AU/mL) with 3 % increase in specific activity when compared to 20 g/L glucose. The antimicrobial compound was heat stable (60 min at 100 degrees C) and was active over a wide pH range. It showed bactericidal effect on S. aureus and Listeria monocytogenes by causing 96 and 98 % of cell lysis, respectively. The cell morphology of the treated S. aureus and L. monocytogenes was completely deformed as revealed by scanning electron microscopy, suggesting the high potential of L. plantarum DM5 as natural preservatives in food industry. The antimicrobial compound was purified by 80 % ammonium sulphate precipitation and showed antimicrobial activity of 12,800 AU/mL with 19-fold purification and a molecular mass of 15.2 kDa, indicating the proteinaceous nature of the compound.

AB  - The large mammal and micromammal assemblages from Paleolithic cave sites in northwestern Croatia (Veternica, Velika peeina, and Vindija) suggest the presence of relatively temperate environments without dramatic oscillations in faunal composition during MIS 3, and possibly also including MIS 2 and 4. Species such as woolly rhinoceros, arctic fox, varying hare, and saiga antelope were not present, and the micromammal assemblages show that all taxa are indicators of a temperate, continental climate characterized by somewhat less forested conditions than those present today. Nonetheless, the region does not appear to have served as a refuge for mammals whose distribution today is north of Croatia. The region appears to have had a fairly diverse and productive mammal fauna, which in turn could have supported significant hominin populations. Faunal composition did not dramatically change across the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition (ca. 40 000-30 000 BP). The apparent stability in mammalian faunas could be owing to several factors: A) a depositional/preservational bias for warmer phases, B) dampered climatic oscillations in the region, C) faunal communities buffered from climatic oscillations owing to microclimate, topography, etc. Resolution of these factors requires further research.

AB  - In order to establish an environmental-condition-normalized structural damage alarming method, the seasonal correlation analysis of wavelet packet energy spectrum (WPES) and temperature of Runyang Suspension Bridge is performed by means of the 236-day health monitoring data. The analysis results reveal that the measured WPES has remarkable seasonal correlation with the environmental temperature. The seasonal change of environmental temperature accounts for the variation of the damage alarming parameter I (p) of the dominant frequency bands with an averaged variance of 200%. The statistical modeling technique using a 6th-order polynomial is adopted to formulate the correlation between the WPES and temperature, on the basis of which the abnormal changes of measured damage alarming parameter I (p) are detected using the mean value control chart. It is found that the proposed method can effectively eliminate temperature complications from the time series of WPES and exhibit good capability for detecting the damage-induced 10% variances of the damage alarming parameter I (p) . And the proposed WPES-based method is superior the modal frequency and hence is more suitable for online real-time damage alarming for long-span bridges.

AB  - This article assesses the recent performance of the Turkish economy, questioning whether the currently observed unusual boom conditions will lead to a process of sustainable growth. The latest phase of Turkish neo-liberal transformation in the post-2001 era is placed in a broader historical and global context; at the same time, the performance of the economy in recent years is compared with that of other key emerging markets, based on selected macroeconomic indicators. Utilizing the East Asian experience as the principal benchmark for comparison, this paper examines whether Turkey is on its way to accomplishing tiger-like development performance. Given the current challenges to sustainable growth, we conclude that it is premature to suggest that the impressive performance of the recent years will lead to durable success and tiger-like performance. While the focus is on the Turkish experience, the paper also probes the very nature of tiger-like performance itself, highlighting the fact that in setting standards for exceptional economic performance we need to extend our horizons beyond high rates of economic growth sustained over time, to broader indicators of social, political and human development.

AB  - Lake Pupuke provides a near-complete, high-resolution environmental record of the Holocene from northern New Zealand. Tephra beds constrain the timing of a range of proxy indicators of environmental change, and demonstrate errors in a radiocarbon chronology. Agathis australis forest progressively increases from c. 7000 yr BP and, in conjunction with indicators of reduced biomass productivity, support a model of long-term climate change to drier conditions over the Holocene. However, except for Agathis, conifer-hardwood forest dominated mainly by Dacrydium cupressinum shows little change throughout the pre-human Holocene, suggesting environmental stability. Dramatic vegetation change occurred only within the last millennium as a result of large-scale Polynesian deforestation by fire. This happened a short time before the local eruption of c. 638 cal. yr BP Rangitoto Tephra. The identification of two eruptions of tephra from Rangitoto volcano has implications for future hazard planning in the Auckland region, because the volcanoes were previously considered single event centres. Changes in atmospheric circulation since the Late Glacial, possibly causing lower frequency of distal ashfall in Auckland during the Holocene, complicates the use of long-term records in hazard frequency assessment.

AB  - The widespread call for a transition toward "ecosystem-based" fisheries management implies the development and testing of sustainability indicators suitable for inferences on the status of the ecosystems within which fisheries resource species are embedded. The mean trophic level (TL) of fisheries catches has been shown to allow for such inferences, leading in the process to the identification of global trends toward catches being increasingly dominated by low-TL species, a process now known as "fishing down marine food webs." However, for inferences from TL trends to be accurate, taxonomic and especially geographic over-aggregation of the underlying catch data must be avoided. Accounting for these strong sources of bias suggests that the fishing down effect is far more pervasive than previously thought, and in fact occurs in areas where initial analyses failed to detect it. This confirms the common verdict of absent sustainability for most fisheries of the world. This is illustrated here by five brief case studies, of which three also document a new method for estimating ecosystem transfer efficiency, under a set of specific conditions, from time series of catches and their corresponding mean TL. Some suggestions are given on how work in this area might proceed.

AB  - Developmental instability and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) have become important topics in evolutionary biology. For example, it has been suggested that FA could be a useful tool for identification of genetic and environmental stress factors. This study used plants from each of six populations of Scabiosa canescens and Scabiosa columbaria grown under greenhouse conditions. I tested whether there was a relationship between petal FA and allozyme heterozygosity, the heritabilities of eight traits, and population size. Flowers displayed no directional asymmetry or antisymmetry. The rare species S. canescens had significantly higher FA values than S. columbaria, but only the latter demonstrated interpopulation differentiation for the expression of FA levels. There was no evidence for an association between population-level FA and genetic variation when compared with the allozyme heterozygosity or with the heritabilities of the quantitative traits. A tendency for a negative association between FA and population size was found for both species, but it was not significant when adjusted for multiple comparison. Hence, flower FA should not be considered a reliable indicator of the amount of genetic variation in populations of S. canescens and S. columbaria.

AB  - Modern pourer systems are currently operating under heavily loaded conditions due to various economic, environmental and regulatory changes. Consequently, maintaining voltage stability has become a growing concern for electric power utilities, With increased loading and exploitation of the power transmission system, the problem of voltage stability and voltage collapse attracts more and more attention, A voltage collapse can take place in systems and subsystems and can appear quite abruptly, There are different methods used to study the voltage collapse phenomenon, such as the Jacobian method, the voltage instability proximity index and the voltage collapse proximity indicator method. This paper is concerned with the problem of voltage stability and investigates a proposed voltage collapse proximity indicator applicable to the load points of a power system. Voltage instability is early predicted using artificial neural networks (ANN) on the basis of a voltage collapse proximity indicator. Different system loading strategies are studied and evaluated. Test results on a sample power system demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach. The objective of this paper is to present the application of ANN in estimating the voltage collapse proximity indicator of a power system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with an environmental impact assessment of low water flow in the river Ganges during a dry period at the Khulna and Mongla port areas in south-western Bangladesh. Large-scale surface water withdrawal in India after commissioning the Farakka Barrage causes a drastic fall in the Ganges low-flow condition within the Bangladesh territory during every dry period. The average lowest discharge in the Ganges is 552 m(3)/s, which is about 73% less than that in the pre-Farakka time. This has caused the deterioration of both surface and groundwater quality of the study area. Salinity is the principal cause of water quality degradation in the area, Present observation shows that the surface water of the area is sulphate-chloride dominated, which signifies high salinity whereas the groundwater is categorized as of medium to high salinity. To maintain the Rupsa River's maximum salinity below 1000 muS/cm the discharge in Garai basin is similar to 10 m(3)/s. If this present situation continues it will be a crippling blow to the environment of the area in the long term. An integrated multidisciplinary approach to hydrogeological refurther deterioration.

AB  - A high-resolution 5500 year palaeolimnological record from Kajemarum Oasis, a closed basin in the Manga Grasslands of northern Nigeria, provides evidence of environmental change in Subsaharan Africa during the Holocene. Palaeohydrological variations, mainly changes in the balance between precipitation and evaporation, are recorded by stable oxygen isotope ratios in bulk carbonate and ostracod calcite and by the Sr/Ca ratio in ostracode shells. Variations in the carbon isotope ratios in carbonates indicate changes in primary productivity in the lake, whereas the carbon isotope composition of organic carbon reflects ecophysiological processes within the lake and its surrounding catchment. Results indicate that there have been marked environmental changes in the Manga Grasslands over the last 5500 years. A more variable climate set in around 1500 cai. a sp. A prolonged drought between 1200 and 1000 cal. a sp. with reduced aquatic productivity, was followed by a switch to a wetter, but still unstable climate: moist conditions prevailed during the Little Ice Age. The results indicate that drought has affected the Sahel episodically over the last 1500 years and is not solely a twentieth-century phenomenon.

AB  - A detailed field investigation has been completed at a gasoline-contaminated aquifer near Rocky Point, NC, to examine possible indicators of intrinsic bioremediation and identify factors that may significantly influence the rate and extent of bioremediation, The dissolved plume of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) in ground water is naturally degrading, Toluene and o-xylene are most rapidly degraded followed by m-, p-xylene, and benzene, Ethylbenzene appears to degrade very slowly under anaerobic conditions present in the center of the plume, The rate and extent of biodegradation appears to be strongly influenced by the type and quantity of electron accepters present in the aquifer, At the upgradient edge of the plume, nitrate, ferric iron, and oxygen are used as terminal electron accepters during hydrocarbon biodegradation, The equivalent of 40 to 50 mg/l of hydrocarbon is degraded based on the increase in dissolved CO2 relative to background ground water, Immediately downgradient of the source area, sulfate and iron are the dominant electron accepters, Toluene and o-xylene are rapidly removed in this region, Once the available oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate are consumed, biodegradation is limited and appears to be controlled by mixing and aerobic biodegradation at the plume fringes.

AB  - The Wajid Group is a Palaeozoic siliciclastic succession of southern Saudi Arabia. In the outcrop belt it is ca. 500 m thick, whereas in the subsurface, the thickness increases to more than 4,500 m. The siliciclastic sediments have great reservoir potential for hydrocarbons and for groundwater. Although they represent one of the most important aquifers of the Arabian Peninsula, neither their sedimentologic, lithostratigraphic, nor their reservoir characteristics are satisfactorily known. In this study, a detailed description of lithology and sedimentology is given and the Wajid Group sediments are interpreted in terms of depositional environment and facies architecture. Thirteen lithofacies (LF 1 to LF 13) have been recognised, most of them composed of different subfacies. These lithofacies are grouped into 9 lithofacies associations (LF-A1 through LF-A9). LF-A1 through LF-A3 and LF-A7 represent shallow-marine siliciclastic environments. The remaining lithofacies associations describe periglacial environments of the Hirnantian (Late Ordovician) and Permian Gondwana glaciations. Except for a few pro-glacial fluvial deposits, fluvial successions and aeolian sediments are absent in the outcrops of the Wajid Sandstone.
   Five formations are recognised in the Wajid Group: the Dibsiyah, Sanamah, Qalibah, Khusayyayn, and Juwayl formations. They are all separated by major unconformities. The Dibsiyah Formation represents a vast sand-sheet complex with core and margin facies formed under shallow-marine conditions. These marine conditions enabled an abundant fauna to proliferate and leave its traces in the form of Skolithos piperock and Cruziana sp. A late Cambrian to Early Ordovician age is inferred for these deposits from regional considerations. The Sanamah Formation records the Late Ordovician Hirnantian glaciation with coarse sandstones and conglomerates. A variety of glacier-induced sedimentary structures are present. The internal succession is composed of three major sediment packages reflecting three ice advance-retreat cycles. The latest of these cycles is overlain by a few metres of marginal-marine sediments of the Qalibah Formation. The Khusayyayn Formation was deposited probably during Early Devonian times. It also represents a sand-sheet environment characterised by the dominance of mega-scale and giant cross beds and bed sets. A marine depositional environment is assumed from scarce Skolithos sp., and because nearly all indicators of a braided river system are absent. The Juwayl Formation of Permian age was deposited at the interface of the Late Palaeozoic Gondwana ice shield with a large lake that may have covered most of southern Arabia and adjacent areas. Proglacial sandstones and conglomerates were deposited close to the glaciers, whereas fine-grained sediment with dropstones, boulder pavements and a wide spectrum of soft-sediment deformation are characteristic of the lake environment. While the two glacial successions and the Khusayyayn Formation can rather confidently be attributed to the geological time scale, either through seismic correlation or biostratigraphically, the Dibsiyah Formation has not yet been biostratigraphically well dated.

AB  - Knowledge of the moisture and temperature conditions influencing growth of microoganisms in honey has long been used to control the spoilage of honey. However, the need for additional microbiological data on honey will increase as new technologies for, and uses of honey develop. Microorganisms in honey may influence quality or safety. Due to the natural properties of honey and control measures in the honey industry, honey is a product with minimal types and levels of microbes. Microbes of concern in post-harvest handling are those that are commonly found in honey (i.e., yeasts and spore-forming bacteria), those that indicate the sanitary or commercial quality of honey (i.e., coliforms and yeasts), and those that under certain conditions could cause human illness.
   Primary sources of microbial contamination are likely to include pollen, the digestive tracts of honey bees, dust, air, earth and nectar, sources which are very difficult to control. The same secondary (after-harvest) sources that influence any food product are also sources of contamination for honey. These include air, food handlers, cross-contamination, equipment and buildings. Secondary sources of contamination are controlled by good manufacturing practices.
   The microbes of concern in honey are primarily yeasts and spore-forming bacteria. Total plate counts from honey samples can vary from zero to tens of thousands per gram for no apparent reason. Most samples of honey contain detectable levels of yeasts. Although yeast counts in many honey samples are below 100 colony forming units per gram (cfu/g), yeasts can grow in honey to very high numbers. Standard industry practices control yeast growth. Bacterial spores. particularly those in the Bacillus genus, are regularly found in honey. The spores of C. botulinum are found in a fraction of the honey samples tested - normally at low levels. No vegetative forms of disease-causing bacterial species have been found in honey. Bacteria do not replicate in honey and as such high numbers of vegetative bacteria could indicate recent contamination from a secondary source. Certain vegetative microbes can survive in honey, at cool temperatures. for several years. However, honey has anti-microbial properties that discourage the growth or persistence of many microorganisms. Typically, honey can be expected to contain low numbers and a limited variety of microbes.
   A routine microbiological examination of honey might include several different assays. A standard plate count provides general information. Specialized tests, such as a count of yeasts and an assay for bacterial spore-formers. may also be useful. An indicator of sanitary quality as provided by coliform counts might be included. Additional tests, to explain unusually high counts or address a certain problem, may be needed. The use of honey in products that receive no or limited heat treatment may require additional tests. More information on the source and control of microbes in honey is needed to answer the concerns currently facing the industry.

AB  - Situated along the Yanbu Suture Zone, the Al-Wask ophiolite is one of the largest and best-preserved ophiolite sequences in the Proterozoic Arabian shield. A mantle section of serpentinized ultramafics is structurally overlain by a crustal section of gabbros and pillow lavas. The whole ophiolite sequence is capped by pelagic sedimentary cover, and tectonically emplaced over a metamorphosed island-arc volcano-sedimentary succession. The Al-Wask ultramafic rocks are strongly deformed, metamorphosed, and altered by carbonatization and silicification. Samples dominated by antigorite indicate upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies peak metamorphic grade, whereas samples dominated by lizardite and magnesite preserve lower grade conditions that we interpret as a cooling path buffered to low CO2 activity by the increasing stability of magnesite with decreasing temperature. Nearly all the primary silicate minerals have been replaced by serpentine minerals, leaving only relics of primary olivine and chromian spinel. Petrographic observation of relict olivine and spinel and of mesh and bastite textures in the serpentines suggest that the peridotite protoliths were mainly harzburgite with minor dunite. Whole-rock compositions of serpentinites show low CaO (<0.1 wt.%), Al2O3 (<1.5 wt.%), and Y (<0.4 ppm) combined with high Mg# (0.90-0.92), Ni, Co, and Cr contents; all these indicate a highly refractory mantle protolith. The mineral chemistry of relict primary spinel and olivine provides additional petrogenetic and geodynamic indicators. The high Cr# (> 60) and low TiO2 (<= 0.2 wt. %) of spinel and high forsterite contents (90-92) of associated olivine indicate residual mantle that underwent extensive partial melt extraction. The whole-rock and mineral chemistry of the serpentinized ultramafic rocks are both consistent with extracted melt fractions from similar to 32 to 38 percent. This extent of melting is typical of fore-arc supra-subduction zone settings, which is the most likely tectonic environment for formation and preservation of the Al-Wask ophiolite.
   Two types of magnesite deposits can be distinguished in the Al-Wask mantle section: an early generation of massive magnesite and a later generation of magnesite veins. Hence the Al-Wask ophiolite underwent multiple stages of carbonatization, likely involving different sources of CO2-bearing fluids. The massive magnesite likely formed at relatively high temperature during cooling from peak metamorphic condition from CO2-bearing fluid probably derived from decomposition of subducted carbonates. Using thermodynamic calculations in the simple MgO-SiO2-H2O-CO2 system, we constrain the path of the reaction boundary where lizardite and magnesite can coexist at equilibrium. On the other hand, the cryptocrystalline magnesite veins fill tectonic fractures and likely formed at low temperature and shallow levels, after serpentinization and ophiolite obduction.

AB  - Investigating the so-called Third Pole Environment (TPE) became a major concern during the last decades since it was recognized that the high-altitude region of the Tibetan Plateau(TP) is a key area for the understanding of cause-effect mechanisms driven by climate change and geodynamic processes. Studies on the hydro-climatic evolution during the Late Quaternary were mainly carried out by single lake records or alternatively by individual terrestrial sites. Integrated source-to sink studies considering lake-catchment interactions were extremely seldom utilized. We investigated such relationships in the Kuhai Basin on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau and analysed sedimentary processes based on 30 onshore sections and three sediment cores from different locations and water depth in the lake basin. Grain size variations, ostracod assemblages, geochemical proxies and absolute dating (luminescence, radiocarbon, Pb-210/Cs-137) were applied as key indicators that reveal interacting sediment fluxes under different hydro-climatic settings during the Younger Dryas interval and the Holocene. Our results indicate that wind-induced transportation processes and allocation of respective aeolian sands in the catchment are attributed to distinct phases of reduced effective moisture availability during summer time. Those phases corresponded to weak summer monsoon influence during the Younger Dryas interval, the Early Holocene (11.6-7.5 ka), dry-cold interlude (DCI: ca. 4.5-3.0 ka), Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP: ca. 1.8-1.1 ka) and the Little Ice Age (LIA: ca. 0.6-0.1 ka). Contemporaneous low lake levels during these periods corresponded with respective aeolian sand flux and variable composition of mixed sediments (fluvial and aeolian) in lake deposits. Different flux rates at the core sites could be assigned to local conditions in respect to inflow behaviour of individual drainage systems and nearshore morphology. Aeolian deposits in the catchment were not always preserved and underwent re -mobilisation during succeeding episodes and/or erosion during phases of high water availability. Wetter climatic conditions during the Mid -Holocene (ca. 7.5-5.1 ka), Roman Warm Period (RWP: ca. 2.8-1.5 ka) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA: ca. 0.9-0.6 ka) revealed significant lake level rise due to enhanced river discharge, well documented by highest suspended flux rates, disappearance of ostracod communities at core sites and very low sand input. Climate shifts during the Holocene were linked to variations in effective moisture supply under the influence of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and the interplay with the mid-latitude westerlies (MLW). Cold-dry phases were likely a response to North Atlantic climatic anomalies transmitted by the MLW across the TP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The hygiene procedures in poultry slaughterhouses consist in the use of hot water, detergent and sanitizing, configuring Sanitation Standard Operating Procedure (SSOP). These actions control contamination in food processing environments, especially by pathogenic microorganisms, which cause diseases with impact on public health and economic losses. The microbiological control of aerobic mesophiles, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, are used as indicators of contamination. The hygienic-sanitary conditions on the surfaces of the poultry slaughterhouse cuttting room were evaluated, before and after cleaning and sanitizing procedures.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Conventional microbiology (Rodac plates and sponge for quantification of aerobic mesophiles, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and ATP-Bioluminescence were used to analyze the action of hot water and the active principles peracetic acid, quaternary ammonia and biguanide in the standard pre-operational hygiene procedure in the cutting room of the poultry slaughterhouse under Federal Inspection with slaughter capacity of more than 20.000 birds/h. The evaluations were performed on three lines of chicken thigh cuts at the same time and in a completely randomized manner on stainless steel surfaces, polyurethane belts and polyethylene boards. Samples were made in four replicates at the three surface totaling 108 assay for each microorganism. The samples were collected at the end of the cutting process, before and after washing the surfaces with hot water (between 45 and 50 degrees C) and after sanitization with 0.5% peracetic acid, 2% quaternary ammonia and 1% biguanide. The ATP-Bioluminescence method detected organic matter at all collected points and Rodac plates allowed a better recovery of microorganisms than sponges for quantification of aerobic mesophiles, E. coli and S. aureus. There was a reduction of contamination after the action of hot water and, after using quaternary ammonia and peracetic acid, there was no isolation of E. coli and S. aureus on all evaluated surfaces.
   Discussion: The use of different methods of analysis for monitoring the hygiene and sanitary status of contact surfaces with chicken cuts allows greater flexibility in relation to hygiene control. The use of the bioluminescent ATP detection method allows detecting in seconds extremely low levels of contamination, allowing a quick determination of the cleaning efficiency on the surfaces and evaluation of the hygiene programs.
   Conventional microbiology methods, on the other hand, provide indicators of contamination by different microorganisms on food contact surfaces. Both are applicable in SSOP monitoring programs and sanitary conditions of the contact surfaces in food producing establishments. The significant reduction of microorganisms on surfaces after cleaning, found in this study, demonstrates the importance of operational hygiene in the maintenance of microbial contamination below the recommended limits, and to reconcile the ATP-Bioluminescence methodologies and Rodac plates can bring benefits to the control of this contamination, and the use of ATP-bioluminescence makes possible taking immediate corrective measures after the evaluation of sanitation procedures.

AB  - This review summarises information on some key factors that are relevant for aquaculture of Atlantic salmon in closed containment systems. These factors include expected growth performance, oxygen demand and production of metabolites, as well as required water quality and maximum fish density.
   The thermal growth coefficient (TGC) appears to be a good predictor of expected mean growth of Atlantic salmon within the temperature range of 4-14 degrees C. The mean TGC reported in some recent growth studies is 2.7, which is somewhat higher than the 2.4-2.5 reported from the Norwegian. Scottish and Chilean salmon industry. While TGC can predict long-term growth performance, in the short-term TGC can be variable, fluctuating seasonally between periods of TGC values in excess of 4.5 to negative values (weight loss). These fluctuations in growth rate and associated variations in metabolic rate are not always dependent on temperature and must be taken into account when designing closed containment systems.
   Several models have been proposed that predict the oxygen consumption of Atlantic salmon based on fish size, activity and ambient temperature. Oxygen consumption can also be predicted from feed intake. However, the models are only indicators and actual values for oxygen consumption may deviate significantly from the predicted values depending on feed intake and growth rate for example. The rate of production of waste metabolites can be predicted from oxygen consumption rates using the respiratory quotient (for CO2) and ammonia quotient (for NH3).
   Water quality (primarily oxygen, CO2 and NH3) has a significant effect on the growth of Atlantic salmon. There is evidence to indicate that growth rate increases progressively with oxygen saturation up to at least 100% saturation. Furthermore, CO2 and NH3 levels may limit the growth of Atlantic salmon when they exceed 10 mg L-1 and 0.012 mg L-1, respectively.
   There is evidence to indicate that salmon density up to at least 80 kg(-1) m(3) does not limit the growth or survival of Atlantic salmon provided that water quality is maintained within acceptable limits. At higher densities both growth rate and fish welfare may be compromised. Regardless, in practical applications the maximum density of Atlantic salmon in a closed containment system may be determined more by the technical and logistical problems of maintaining acceptable water quality rather than the growth rate of the fish.
   Closed containment systems offer possibilities of rearing Atlantic salmon under controlled conditions at high densities. They offer possibilities for optimising growth conditions for fish. However, comparatively high production cost of maintaining water quality may preclude competition with conventional cage rearing systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the effects of conservation-oriented tillage practices on soil structure is critical for sustainable soil management. We therefore investigated the effects of reduced tillage (RT) and conventional moldboard plough-based tillage (CT) on soil structure parameters in the 0-5 cm topsoil of a typical Danish morainic sandy loam Agrudalf. The experimental field had been under a 7 year tillage experiment with continuous winter wheat. Soil samples were taken 6 times during the tillage year, starting with tillage in October. Wet aggregate stability (WAS; 1-2 mm aggregates) and aggregate size distribution including the geometric mean diameter (GMD; aggregates <63 mm) were determined using a wet sieving methodology, and using samples pre-treated by air drying and samples kept at the field moist condition. The dry aggregate stability (DAS; 1-2 mm aggregates) was determined using a dry sieving methodology. A performance test of the wet sieving methodology revealed a high level of reproducibility.
   The aggregate stability and distribution parameters varied significantly over the tillage year and across tillage treatments and were influenced by sieving methodology and sample pre-treatment. The WAS under field moist conditions varied from about 40% (RT) and 65% (CT) shortly after tillage in October to 70% (RT) and 65% (CT) in June with a minimum in December of 25% (RT) and 30% (CT) when field water content peaked. Air drying resulted in higher WAS values (60% to 80%), especially for samples taken under high field water content, and generally enhanced the usefulness of WAS as an indicator of variability of aggregate stability. The changes in stability was accompanied by changes in the aggregate size distribution, with soil from the reduced tillage treatment generally having higher fractions of large aggregates (2-6.3 mm) and higher geometric mean diameter.
   Compared to conventional tillage, reduced tillage improved soil structure through a combination of increased soil organic matter, reduced soil bulk density and increased proportion of larger aggregates. The effect on aggregate stability was complex, increasing the stability of aggregates against water content related forces of disintegration (WAS) while reducing the stability against mechanical forces (DAS). The harrowing in the reduced tillage practice should be reviewed, as it was relatively intense and adversely affected soil stability shortly after tillage. The study highlights (i) the importance of analysing temporal changes in soil structure parameters when evaluating tillage practices. (ii) that soil stability needs to be assessed in the context of the nature of disintegrating forces. and (iii) the importance of using both wet and dry sieving technology coupled with field moist and air dry samples for a more comprehensive analysis of aggregate stability and size distribution parameters.

AB  - Building and urban acoustic environments greatly contribute to the quality of healthy buildings. This paper first discusses the developmental transitions from noise control to soundscape construction, and the changing focus from negative effects on public health to the promotion of health benefits. During this transition, the impacts of acoustic environments on human health have been investigated from various research perspectives, from concept to theory to methods. In current soundscape research, sound environment designs are based on health concepts. Innovative results have been introduced from this focus. First, the impacts of soundscape perception on human health and the psychophysiological effects of soundscape have been extensively reviewed. Reduced negative soundscapes are significantly positively correlated with the self-reported health conditions of subjects. Especially, soundscapes reported as positive (e.g., pleasant and calm) are significantly positively correlated with environmental stress restoration. The physiology and neurophysiology of soundscapes are emerging subjects that require extensive further research. Research on the restorative effects of urban public open spaces has included the development of relevant theories and practice, experimental studies of restorative performance and its influencing factors, and sensitivity studies, which measure the response magnitude of physiological indicators to typical soundscapes. The restorative quality of public open spaces in the urban context is of particular interests. Soundscapes in public open spaces are known to directly affect the psychology, physiology, and attention span of individuals. They also exert an indirect recovery effect through audio-visual interactions. A study on the sensitivity study of physiological indicators analyzed the change of the physiological signals over time, the type of scenery, and the restoration effect was quantified from the relationships among different subjective scales. Stressed children exposed to different potentially restorative soundscapes perceive the restorative sound scenery differently from adults. The effect of noise on the cognitive performance of children is primarily reflected in the degree of subjective annoyance, and children's test performances do not significantly depend on the varying noise conditions. In specific spaces such as hospitals, the acoustic environment is known to affect inpatient health and the efficiency of hospital staff. Studies have confirmed that improving the acoustic environment benefits the resting ability, sleep, and mood of inpatients, and this can also improve the efficiency of hospital staff.
   With the broadening and deepening of acoustic environment research and the effective development of research tools, indicator systems and research paradigms will become more standardized. Such standardization will further deepen the research and lead to evaluative standards. Much scope remains for investigating the impact mechanism and efficiency of various soundscape restorative treatments in urban public open spaces. Furthermore, the health effects of soundscape treatments for other specific groups of people and other specific spaces should be elucidated. Finally, research should move from revealing the influence patterns and tendencies of soundscapes toward the active design of healthy acoustic environments.

AB  - Soils of the Mediterranean area are subjected to erosion due to the cropping systems and crop managements adopted. This causes a loss of crop productivity that could be initially replaced with an increase of fertilizers, but in the end leads to land abandonment. The areas subjected to soil erosion in the Mediterranean area cover 1,309,000 km(2), equal to 15 % of the land of Mediterranean countries. In dry farming condition, the farmer's choices are often constrained by the prevailing climatic conditions. Rainfall amount and distribution represent the main constraints that lead farmers to choose annual autumn-winter crops. In this environment, the growing cycle of autumn-winter crops, such as durum wheat, determines a lack of soil covering during the first rains that occur in early autumn and winter. Soil losses by erosion also determine nutrient losses and affect soil organic matter content. All these aspects are evaluated by ongoing research started in 1996 in an area of the internal hills of Sicily (Italy) in the center of the Mediterranean basin. In this experimental site, on a 27 % slope, the effect of different cropping systems to determine surface runoff and soil losses was evaluated. In each plot, (40 x 8) m, a series of devices were installed in order to determine the amount of runoff and sediment: four covered trap channels were installed at the bottom of each plot, each channel drained into pipes which emptied into a tank to collect surface runoff and soil losses. After each erosive rainfall, the amount of water, of sediments, and the nitrate-nitrogen were measured. Soil organic matter was determined every fall at 0-30 and 31-60 cm depth. The highest annual values of soil losses were observed in the annual tilled crops, such as the typical Mediterranean crop rotation "durum wheat-durum wheat-fallow" (11.2 t ha(-1) year(-1)). Very low soil losses were observed in the plots managed with perennial crops, alfalfa (0.34 t ha(-1) year(-1)), Italian ryegrass in pure stand and in mixtures with subterranean clover (3.2 t ha(-1) year(-1)), and subterranean clover (1.7 t ha(-1) year(-1)). The perennial giant miscanthus and moon trefoil reduced soil losses to 0.1 t ha(-1) year(-1). The benefit of the cultivation of perennial crops instead of tilled crops was also highlighted in relation to organic matter content. The rotation "giant miscanthus (from 1997 to 2001)-moon trefoil (from 2002 to 2015)" made it possible to increase soil organic matter from 1.03 to 2.51 % in the average of the first 60 cm soil depth.

AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse the vegetation changes of the Phragmitetea class in the valley of the Bystra river in Eastern Poland after a period of 41 years, identify the direction of plant communities succession, and to analysis of changes based on the average values of Ellenberg's indicators calculated for particular reed communities. The studies were conducted in the years 1973 and 2014 in the valley of the Bystra river, on grasslands of an area of approx. 30 ha belonging to farmers from the following localities: Nalcczow (2.5 ha), Lqki (2.7 ha), Wqwolnica (4.9 ha), Mareczki (3.0 ha), Rogalow (2.3 ha), Zawada (1.6 ha), Bartlomiejowice (3.3 ha), Chmielnik (0.9 ha), Gora (1.1 ha), Szczuczki (1.4 ha), Lubki (2.4 ha) and Nowy Gaj (3.6). The Bystra river (Eastern Poland) starts in Czeslawice and flows from the east to the west, emptying into the Vistula at Bochotnica. It is fed by several streams, the largest of which is the Czerka river. The mouths of these streams and the numerous springs form pools of stagnant water where rush communities of the Phragmitetea class occur. 44 phytosociological releves were performed in 1973 and 41 in 2014 according to the Braun-Blanquet (1964) method. The floristic diversity after a period of 41 years was identified based on the phytosociological structure and mean number of species in the particular releves of the phytocoe- noses under study. Changes of the climatic (L - light, T - temperature, K - continentality) and edaphic (F - moisture, R - reaction, N - nitrogen content) conditions were assessed using ecological indicator values by Ellenberg et al. (1992). The Caricetum gracilis association (57% of the patches) was the dominant plant community from the Phragmitetea class in the valley of the Bystra river in 1973 and 2014. The other communities included Phrag-mitetum australis, Glycerietum maximae and Phalaridetum arundinaceae. The plant communities from the Phragmitetea class are characterised by a high resistance to anthropogenic pressure because most of the patches of the analysed associations in the Bystra valley survived in unchanged form for 41 years. Most changes in the vegetation cover of the rush communities resulted from the abandonment, which first leads to reduced floristic diversity manifested in the dominance of characteristic species and disappearance of low plants. In the second stage, secondary succession can occur, manifested in a greater abundance of shrubs and trees, which was observed after 41 years in the Bystra valley in the form of communities of the Alnion glutinosae alliance. Other changes in the plant communities occurred as a result of changes in habitat conditions (lower values of Ellenberg's indices) and systematic utilisation, which led to the more frequent occurrence of species from the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea class.

AB  - Liquid thermolysis products of various types of immature kerogen from sedimentary lacustrine rocks from the Valjevo-Mionica basin in Serbia were studied to evaluate the generation potential of kerogen contained in the organic matter (OM) of the rocks, determine the composition of the biomarkers and alkylaromatics in the liquid thermolysis products, and elucidate the effect of Pt4+ and Ru3+ ions (which were added in the form of inorganic salts) on the yield and hydrocarbon composition of the liquid thermolysis products. For this purpose, representative bitumen-free samples A and B of the sedimentary rocks were subjected to thermolysis under various conditions. Rock A contains high amount of immature organic matter, which is dominated by kerogen type I/II and was generated under strongly reduced sedimentation conditions at a high salinity. Sample B is poorer in immature OM than sample A, and the OM of the former contains kerogen type II/III and was generated predominantly in a reduced environment. The content of the liquid products and the concentrations of hydrocarbons obtained in the course of thermolysis of bitumen-free sample A and the typical oil distribution of the biomarkers and alkylaromatics in the thermolysis products confirm a high generation potential of OM in this rock. In all of our experiments on the thermolysis of bitumen-free sample B, the yield of liquid products and hydrocarbons is low. According to the kerogen type, the thermolysis of this rock generates much gases. The Pt4+ and Ru3+ ions (added in the form of simple inorganic salts) increased the yield of liquid (kerogen type I/II) and gaseous (kerogen type II/III) products. During the thermolysis of various type of immature kerogen in the lacustrine sedimentary rocks at a temperature of 400A degrees C, the OM attained maturation corresponding to the early catagenesis level. Saturated biomarkers and alkylaomatics in the thermolysis products of both samples display typical oil distributions. The type of the source OM most strongly affects the composition of n-alkanes and alkylnaphthalenes. The metal ions used in this research served as catalysts for the methylation process during the thermolysis of immature kerogen, regardless of its type. The effect of the Pt4+ and Ru3+ ions on other transformations of the hydrocarbons, for example, the destruction of high-molecular n-alkanes to low-molecular ones and on isomerization reactions in molecules of polycyclic biomarkers and alkylaromatics to thermodynamically more stable isomers in the thermolysis products is controlled, first of all, by the type of the source OM.

In 2018, June was the hottest month, while February was the coldest month in Volgograd region. The maximum deviation from the average monthly temperature was observed in March. July and January were the hottest and the coldest months, respectively, in Samara region. During the research period, the species of wild roses retained the life form of habitus, and their height varied from 1.0-2.0 m (medium-grown species) to 0.7-0.9 m (short species). Data on the resistance of rosehip species to the maximum and minimum temperatures can be the factual basis of system-arealogical forecasting for geographical points of introduction. The degree of demand of rosehips to soil fertility and light was revealed by poor-demanding species: R. beggeriana, R. cinnamomea, R. rugosa and R. spinosissima. The observing method of the Main Botanical garden, field and laboratory observations allowed to establish the duration of the phenological phases of the studied species. Rosehips, being ornamental throughout the growing season, are useful in forest reclamation and landscaping, depending on the growth and color of their flowers. Types of diseases and parasitic fungi were determined by mycological analysis and reference data. The most common disease of the studied species of rosehips is powdery mildew from the genus Sphaerotheca. Amino acid profile of rosehip fruits was determined by the capillary electrophoresis system "Kapel" at a wavelength of 250 nm and allowed to identify the most valuable by biochemical composition species. In the period of monitoring the winter hardiness of rosehips, the best result was shown by the species R. rugosa, R. cinnamomea and R. canina, belonging to the North American, European and Far Eastern collections. The method of a priori ranking of fruiting indicators based on the division of factors in the descending order of their contribution revealed the most promising species for use in bio-technology. The total sum of ranks and the sum of squares of deviations were determined; the concordance coefficient and the degree of consistency of the researchers' opinions are obtained in accordance with the degrees-of-freedom breakdown. It was found that the use of biotechnological methods in modern seed production is the most pressing; the obtained results will contribute to the improvement and acceleration of the seed production process in the arid conditions of Volgograd region. Recommendations are given for the cultivation of rosehips depending on the natural and climatic conditions of the different districts of the region.

AB  - Time series now have sufficient duration to determine harmful algal bloom (HAB) responses to changing climate conditions, including warming, stratification intensity, freshwater inputs and natural patterns of climate variability, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Against the context of time series, such as those available from phytoplankton monitoring, dinoflagellate cyst records, the Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys, and shellfish toxin records, it is possible to identify extreme events that are significant departures from long-term means. Extreme weather events can mimic future climate conditions and provide a "dress rehearsal" for understanding future frequency, intensity and geographic extent of HABs. Three case studies of extreme HAB events are described in detail to explore the drivers and impacts of these oceanic outliers that may become more common in the future. One example is the chain-forming diatom of the genus Pseudo-nilzschia in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and its response to the 2014-16 northeast Pacific marine heat wave. The other two case studies are pelagic flagellates. Highly potent Alexandrium catenella group 1 dinoflagellate blooms (up to 150 mg/kg PST in mussels; 4 human poisonings) during 2012-17 created havoc for the seafood industry in Tasmania, south-eastern Australia, in a poorly monitored area where such problems were previously unknown. Early evidence suggests that changes in water column stratification during the cold winterspring season are driving new blooms caused by a previously cryptic species. An expansion of Pseudochattonella cf. verruculosa to the south and A. catenella to the north over the past several years resulted in the convergence of both species to cause the most catastrophic event in the history of the Chilean aquaculture in the austral summer of 2016. Together, these two massive blooms were colloquially known as the "Godzilla-Red tide event", resulting in the largest fish farm mortality ever recorded worldwide, equivalent to an export loss of USD$800 million which when combined with shellfish toxicity, resulted in major social unrest and rioting. Both blooms were linked to the strong El Nino event and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode, the latter an indicator of anthropogenic climate change in the southeastern Pacific region. For each of these three examples, representing recent catastrophic events in geographically distinct regions, additional targeted monitoring was employed to improve the understanding of the climate drivers and mechanisms that gave rise to the event and to document the societal response. Scientists must be poised to study future extreme HAB events as these natural experiments provide unique opportunities to define and test multifactorial drivers of blooms.

AB  - Throughout the last glacial cycle, the region between Australia and New Guinea, which is today known as the Gulf of Carpentaria.. has oscillated from open shallow marine conditions to a large, land-locked freshwater lake, including periods of subaerial exposure. Ostracod faunal assemblages and variations in the valve morphology, preserved in the sediments of the gulf, record these changes. A 14.8 in long core (MD972132) extracted from near the centre of the modem Gulf of Carpentaria, spanning the last 130 ka BP provides the basis of this study.
   Environmental facies were determined by R- and Q-mode cluster analysis of the ostracod assemblage data, including 72 species, and comparison with modem analogues from both the Gulf of Carpentaria and Southeast Asian region. Using these methods, six clearly distinct biofacies were identified:
   (i) open shallow marine facies, including bairdiids, pectocytherinids and cytherettids;
   (ii) shallow marine facies, dominated by Cytherella and Hemikrithe;
   (iii) marginal marine facies, including Xestoleberis and Praemunita;
   (iv) tidal channel facies, dominated by Loxoconcha,
   (v) estuarine assemblage, comprising Venericythere and Leptocythere;
   (vi) non-marine facies
   a. brackish lagoon/lake facies dominated by Cyprideis and Leptocythere;
   b. freshwater facies, including Ilyocypris, with Cyprinotus and Cypretta. I
   n addition, morphological variation of valves of the more "plastic" species, in particular Cyprideis australiensis and Leptocythere hartmanni, was observed and related to environmental variables, including salinity and solute composition. These two species occur through more than half of the length of the core and show significant variability. C. australiensis with irregular-shaped sieve pores is associated with heavily reticulated valves of L. hartmanni, around 90-70 ka BP, indicating increased salinity and carbonate-limited environments. Conversely, C. australiensis with round sieve pores occurs with finely reticulated valves of L. hartmanni from around 50 ka BP, in fresher, carbonate-rich environments. The preservation of valves was also noted so as to infer post-depositional effects, revealing shoreline features, channel activity and subaerial exposure.
   Combined ostracod biofacies and morphological analysis reveals a fluctuating marine environment through Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5.. terminating in a restricted la con around 90 ka BP, followed by an extensive period of subaerial exposure in this region of the gulf MIS 3 marks a return of marine conditions and an increase in fluvial activity. Lake Carpentaria then appears as a permanent feature, at least to the current 60 m depth contour, from around 40 ka Bp, with the freshest water occurring around 16 cal. ka BP, prior to the most recent marine transgression, at 10.8 cal. ka BP. Although the presence of Lake Carpentaria had previously been identified, this study extends the knowledge of the region through the last glacial cycle and provides greater detail of the sequential biofacies.

AB  - Background: Menstrual problems can significantly impact daily and work life. In reaction to a shrinking population, the Japanese government is encouraging more women to participate in the labor force. Actual success in achieving this aim, however, is limited. Specifically, participation in the workforce by women during their reproductive years is impacted by their health, which involves not only work conditions, but also traditional family circumstances. Therefore, it is important to further assess and gather more information about the health status of women who work during their reproductive years in Japan. Specifically, women's health can be represented by menstruation status, which is a pivotal indicator. In this study, we assessed the association between short rest periods in work intervals and menstruation and other health status indicators among female workers in Japan.
   Methods: Study participants were recruited from the alumnae of a university, which provided a uniform educational level. All 9864 female alumnae were asked to join the survey and 1630 (17%) accepted. The final sample of study participants (n = 505) were aged 23-43 years, had maintained the same job status for at least 1 year, and were not shift workers, had no maternal status, and did not lack any related information. The participants were divided into two groups according to interval time, with 11 h between end of work and resumption of daily work as a benchmark. This interval time was based on EU regulations and the goal set by the government of Japan. Health outcomes included: menstrual cycle, dysmenorrhoea symptoms, anxiety regarding health, and satisfaction in terms of health. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for health indexes in association with interval time by adjusting for confounding variables that included both psychosocial and biological factors.
   Results: We compared the health status of women in the workforce with and without a sufficient interval time of 11 h/day. Workers who had a short interval time had a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety about health and dissatisfaction with their health. For menstruation status, only abnormal menstruation cycles were observed more often among workers in the short interval group than those of the long interval group. However, this association disappeared when biological confounding factors were adjusted in a multivariable regression model. Dysmenorrhea symptoms did not show a statistically significant association with short interval time.
   Conclusions: This study found a significant association between a short interval time of less than 11 h/day and subjective health indicators and the menstrual health status of women in the workforce. Menstrual health was more affected by biological factors than social psychological factors. A long work time and short interval time could increase worker anxiety and dissatisfaction and may deteriorate the menstrual cycle.

AB  - The accelerated warming of the Arctic climate may alter the local and regional surface energy balances, for which changing land surface temperatures (LSTs) are a key indicator. Modeling current and anticipated changes in the surface energy balance tequires an understanding of the spatio-temporal interactions between LSTs and land cover, both of which can be monitored globally by measurements from space. This paper investigates the accuracy of the MODIS LST/Emissivity Daily L3 Global 1 km V005 product and its spatio-temporal sensitivity to land surface properties in a Canadian High Arctic permafrost landscape. The land cover ranged from fully vegetated wet sedge tundra to barren rock. MODIS LSTs were compared with in situ radiometer measurements from wet tundra areas collected over a 2-year period from July 2008 to July 2010 including both summer and winter conditions. The accuracy of the MODIS LSTs was -1.1 degrees C with a root mean square error of 3.9 degrees C over the entire observation period. Agreement was lowest during the freeze-back periods where MODIS 1ST showed a cold bias likely due to the overrepresentation of clear-sky conditions. A multi-year analysis of LST spatial anomalies, i.e., the difference between MODIS LSTs and the MODIS 1ST regional mean, revealed a robust spatiotemporal pattern. Highest variability in LST anomalies was found during freeze-up and thaw periods as well as for open water surface in early summer due to the presence or absence of snow or ice. The summer anomaly pattern was similar for all three years despite strong differences in precipitation, air temperature and net radiation. Summer periods with regional mean ISTs above 5.0 degrees C showed the greatest spatial diversity with four distinct 2.0 degrees C classes. Summer anomalies ranged from -4.5 degrees C to 2.6 degrees C with an average standard deviation of 1.8 degrees C. Dry ridge areas heated up the most, while wetland areas and dry areas of sparsely vegetated bedrock with a high albedo remained coolest. The observed summer LST anomalies can be used as a baseline against which to evaluate both past and future changes in land surface properties that relate to the surface energy balance. Summer anomaly classes mainly reflected a combination of albedo and surface wetness. The potential to use this tool to monitor surface drying and wetting in the Arctic should therefore be further explored. A multi-sensor approach combining thermal satellite measurements with optical and radar imagery promises to be an effective tool for a dynamic, process-based ecosystem monitoring scheme.

AB  - Problem formulation. In the context of a comprehensive and constant increasing in anthropogenic pressure on the environment, a special role in the preservation of biotic and landscape diversity is assigned to national natural parks (NNP). For organization of large amounts of accumulated factual and theoretical information, the environmental institutions of this level, especially in the management of these conservation areas, are particularly important cartographic materials. In this case, cartographic materials can be used as a methodological basis for territorial-spatial data and the most effective means of research. There is an obvious need to analyze the approaches to the assessment of environmental mapping, in particular, the definition of the mapping features of a particular nature reserve with a generalization and systematization of experience creating maps. These created maps can serve as a kind of information space and NNP tool, depending on the research topic.
   The purpose of the article is to analyze, develop and substantiate the cartographic support of the activities of the territory of Karmelyukove Podillia National Park as the basis for creating a highly effective information space for solving the problems of its sustainable development.
   Methodology and materials. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study, first of all, is as general scientific provisions on the universal interconnection and interdependence of objects and phenomena in nature and society. In addition, the latest geoinformation approaches and statistical methods for processing data from space-time analysis were used. The development of a large-scale mapping methodology was based on the author's personal research during 1998-2020.
   Results. On the example of Karmelyukove Podillia National Park the data of the cartographic support of the NNP were summarized and systematized throughout the entire period of the study of this territory. The structure of the system of cartographic information for planning and conducting rational use of natural resources in the conditions of an environmental institution has been developed and presented. The reasons for the ineffective formation and use of environmental cartographic information "Karmelyukove Podillya" with the definition of ways of its optimization are determined. The demand for the maps of assessment, forecast, recommendation and advertising content is grounded. It is proposed to use the landscape approach and modern GIS technologies as the means for solving the problems of natural resource management and planning of natural resource use by NNP.
   Scientific novelty. For the first time, a complex of studies of cartographic support of Karmelyukove Podillia National Park was performed and the structure of a cartographic information system for planning and organizing rational environmental management was presented. An original cartographic database on NNP has been created, which has been formed over the past 30 years.
   Practical meaning. The formed existing cartographic information base has a great potential for assessing and monitoring landscape and biotic diversity and various nature conservation and recreational activities within the territory of the NNP. At the same time, the cartographic information base can be used as a basic for the formation of multi-scale GIS. It can be used for further scientific developments, maintaining a Record and Cadaster of NNP and implementing of environmental protection measures.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to substantiate prerequisites and prospects for the formation and development of the socially-oriented economy in Ukraine. The theoretical and methodological background to the research is system and synergetic scientific approaches, which use in the research of the development of a socially-oriented economy is determined by orientation to basic values and fundamentals of the market economic system and focus on building a democratic society in Ukraine. Scientific results-it is substantiated that in modern conditions of transformational changes, a strategic course of Ukraine is to combine mechanisms of market self-regulation and state regulation, which in its basis is based on principles of socially-oriented economy. Such a model of the economy is focused on a human along with its needs and interests, relations with other members of society during production, distribution, exchange, and consumption. At the same time, social orientation foresees providing high productive economic management that configures private initiative and competition. Results of conducted analysis of analytical indicators of socioeconomic development of Ukraine show an urgent necessity and objectivity of forming a socially-oriented economy. It is proved that taking into account increase in openness of the national economy, it is appropriate to consider strict conditions concerning its adequacy to requirements of the current international competition. In this relation, there are analysed vectors of the formation of the socially-oriented economy in Ukraine declared by the Strategy of Sustainable Development "Ukraine-2020" within which a key reference point is an introduction in the country of European standards of living and its achieving a dominant position in the world. An economic platform of the formation and development of the socially-oriented economy is determined the following: providing economic freedom; availability of different types of business; development of competition; formation of a free pricing mechanism; creation of market and social infrastructure; formation of a model of the open economy. In addition, tools and measures of socioeconomic policy of the state are: transparency of activities of public authorities at all levels; focus of investment flows on an implementation of the nation's social potential and improvement of the population quality of life; priority of development of a transparent competitive area; demonopolization of business environment; strict control over the compliance with the international practical requirements; successive narrowing a sphere of influence of shadow economy and rooting out corruption; power consolidation and efficient cooperation of all its branches; solving a problem of a conflict in the southeast of Ukraine. Practical implication of the scientific results lies in the fact that the substantiated prerequisites and prospects for the formation and development of socially-oriented economy in Ukraine will contribute to the organization of public production that will combine efficiency of market mechanism and principles of self-organization on the basis of accentualization on achieving high standard of living for all segments of the population.

AB  - Paleolimnological analyses were used to infer limnological changes during the past similar to 300 yrs in the west basin of Peninsula Lake, a small (853 ha) Precambrian Shield lake in Ontario, Canada, that has been subjected to moderate cultural disturbances (forest clearance, cottage and resort development). This study represents a pioneering attempt to use sedimentary chironomid assemblages and weighted-averaging models to quantify past hypolimnetic anoxia (expressed as the anoxic factor, AF). Impacts of forest clearance and human land-use on deepwater oxygen availability and surface water quality were assessed by comparing chironomid-inferred AF and diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentration ([TP]) to changes in terrestrial pollen and historical data. This study also discusses the ability of chironomids to quantitatively infer changes in AF.
   Pre-disturbance chironomid assemblages were stable and dominated by taxa indicative of oxygen-rich hypolimnetic conditions (e.g., Protanypus, Heterotrissocladius, Micropsectra type), while diatoms indicated oligotrophic lake status (diatom inferred [TP] = 5-7 mu g . l(-1)). Chironomids characteristic of lower oxygen availability (e.g., Chironomus, Procladius) increased following land-clearance, road construction, establishment of a grist mill and lakeshore development beginning ca. 1870. Increased abundances of Tanytarsus s. lat., a multigeneric group of mainly littoral chironomids, since 1900, indicated that littoral chironomids may have comprised a greater proportion of fossil assemblages during periods of eutrophication and prolonged anoxia. Abundances of meso-eutrophic diatom taxa (e.g., Fragilaria crotonensis, Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira ambigua, A. subarctica) increased concurrent with European settlement (ca. 1870) and diatom-inferred [TP] doubled (similar to 6-12 mu g . l(-1)), further indicating that naturally- oligotrophic Precambrian Shield lakes were extremely sensitive to initial land-clearance activities.
   Recent increases in oligotrophic diatom taxa (e.g., Cyclotella stelligera) indicate a shift to more oligotrophic conditions since ca. mid-1960s, with greatest changes since ca. 1980. The chironomids Heterotrissocladius and Micropsectra type also increased at this time suggesting greater deepwater oxygen availability. These recent water-quality improvements, possibly in response to enhanced nutrient removal from detergents and sewage, climate-related reductions in external phosphorus loads, and catchment (but not lake) acidification and reforestation, suggest that habitat for commercially-valuable cold-water fishes has improved in recent decades despite greater recreational lake-use.
   Paleolimnological assessment of trophic status changes in Peninsula Lake using fossil diatom and chironomid assemblages were in good agreement. Diatom inferences of [TP] and chironomid inferences of AF both suggest that Peninsula Lake was historically oligotrophic, became oligo-mesotrophic after European settlement, and returned to oligotrophy in recent yrs. Chironomid inferences of [TP] consistently underestimated the trophic status of Peninsula Lake, possibly due to its relatively large hypolimnion. These results suggest that AF represents a useful tool for quantitatively reconstructing the past trophic status of deeper, stratified lakes.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;The health of piglets, especially the health of the gastrointestinal tract, is subject to severe stress during weaning. The use of antibiotics can help piglets to counteract the negative effects of this period. However, the use of antibiotics as growth promoters can increase the risk of antibiotic resistance. For this reason, antibiotic replacement products are sought to promote gut health. We tested the commercial product GreenFIS(R) (New Feed Team Ltd., Lodi, Italy), a blend of natural substances acknowledged as beneficial for gut health, at two levels of inclusion, compared to a control diet, on 60 piglets. No differences were recorded between diets regarding the growth performance. The gut histological analysis performed on some animals did not reveal any difference between diets. Microbiological analyses were also performed on the feces and the piglets fed GreenFIS(R) showed a higher number of a group of bacteria positively associated with starch utilization. After the post-weaning trial, a digestibility study was conducted on six pigs randomly chosen for each treatment. The addition of GreenFIS(R) to the diet led to higher digestibility compared to the control, although it did not reveal, in the excellent hygienic conditions of the experimental farm, a positive effect on the gut heath.& nbsp;The weaning period is a stressful period for the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of piglets. This work aims to evaluate the effects of the commercial polyphenol-based product GreenFIS(R) on: (1) GIT health and performance of 60 weaned piglets; (2) digestibility in 18 growing pigs. Three diets were tested: a control diet (C), C plus 2.5 g of GreenFIS(R)/kg C (T1), and C plus 5 g of GreenFIS(R)/kg C (T2). After the post-weaning trial three piglets per treatment were sacrificed for the GIT histological analysis. No differences between diets were recorded in terms of growing performance or clinical and biochemical blood parameters. The GIT histological analysis did not show any indicators of inflammation for any of the groups. The feces of the two extreme treatments (C and T2) were analyzed for microbiota, revealing a greater presence of the Ruminococcus bromii group, positively associated with starch degradation, in T2. In the second experiment six pigs per treatment were randomly chosen for the digestibility study. The inclusion of GreenFIS(R) at both levels led to a higher fecal digestibility of gross energy (86.2%, 89.1%, and 89.5%, for C, T1, and T2, respectively) and crude protein (87.0%, 90.2%, and 90.0%). In conclusion, the additive did not improve, in the excellent experimental hygienic conditions, the gut health, but it did increase nutrient digestibility.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Pathogenic fungi cause yield and quality losses and threaten food security. In this study, 198 samples of wheat grains, representing 20 Egyptian wheat cultivars, were collected from 25 wheat-growing governorates across Egypt, and screened for their seed-borne fungi. Twenty genera and 44 species of seed-borne fungi were identified, and their biodiversity indicators and evolutionary relationships were studied based upon similarities in their genetic characteristics. The most frequent fungi were Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium spp., while Tilletia tritici and Ustilago tritici were the most common smut fungi. The highest fungal diversity was recorded for Sinai governorate, while the greatest species richness was recorded in Qena and Sohag governorates. Correlations of the detected fungi with weather variables (temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed, or solar radiation) were investigated. Our results indicated that the relative humidity was the most influential weather variable, followed by temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and precipitation, respectively. Despite this study being conducted on the wheat-growing areas in Egypt, our findings are useful for other wheat-growing countries that share the same climatic conditions. The correlation between a given fungus and the climatic variables can be useful in other ecosystems.</p>
   Surveillance investigations for pathogenic and toxigenic fungi are important to refine our understanding of their epidemiology and help in predicting their outbreaks. During 2019, 198 samples of wheat grains were collected from 25 wheat-growing governorates in Egypt to detect and identify seed-borne mycoflora in vitro. Forty-four fungal species belonging to 20 genera were identified. Molecular data for these fungi were analyzed to construct a phylogenetic tree. Occurrence and biodiversity indicators were calculated. Two prevalent pathogens (average incidence > 40%) were Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium spp. Ustilago tritici was present in only seven of the 25 governorates, and less abundant than Tilletia tritici, the causal agent of stinking smut. Sinai governorate recorded the greatest species diversity, while the greatest species richness was in Qena and Sohag governorates. Canonical correspondence analysis of data for 20 fungal genera with temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed or solar radiation revealed that relative humidity was the most influential weather variable. It showed that occurrence and distribution of the 20 genera corresponded well with three out of four Egyptian climatic regions: Mediterranean, semi-arid, and arid. Knowing pathogen occurrence and distribution in Egypt is the first step to developing future disease management strategies to limit yield losses and improve food security. Despite this study being conducted on the wheat-growing areas in Egypt, our findings are useful for other wheat-growing countries that share the same climatic conditions. The correlation between a given fungus and the climatic variables can be useful in other ecosystems.</p>

AB  - Organic carbon stored in high-latitude permafrost represents a potential positive feedback to climate warming as well as a valuable store of paleoenvironmental information. The below-freezing conditions have effectively removed permafrost organic material from the modern carbon cycle and preserved its pre-freezing bulk and molecular states. The conditions that lead to efficient burial of organic carbon (OC) within permafrost were investigated by measuring OC stocks, past accumulation rates, and biogeochemical composition of a permafrost core taken from Interior Alaska dating back to 40 ka. The post-glacial Marine Isotope Stage 1 is represented by the top 1.2 m of the core and contains 64.7 kg OC/m(2) with an accumulation rate of 4.3 g OC/m(2)/yr. The sediments that accumulated around the Last Glacial Maximum contain 9.9 kg OC/m(2) with an accumulation rate of 0.5 g OC/m(2)/yr. Carbon storage (144.7 kg OC/m(2)) and accumulation (26.1 g OC/m(2)/yr) are both observed to be greatest between 35 and 40 ka, late during the Marine Isotope Stage 3 global interstadial. The extent of OC degradation was assessed using lignin and amino acid biomarkers with both approaches indicating well-preserved contemporary active layer and interstadial OC, whereas stadial OC was highly degraded. Lignin compositional indices throughout the core appear altered by sorptive processes that confounded some expected trends in the overall organic matter composition, while amino acids provided a more integrated pattern of change. Significant correlations between carbon-normalized hydroxyproline and total lignin concentrations further support the usefulness of hydroxyproline as an indicator for the abundance of plant organic matter. A novel amino acid plant-microbial index of the ratio of microbial-specific muramic acid and diaminopimelic acid biomarkers to the plant-specific hydroxyproline biomarker, indicate a transition from plant-dominated organic matter in fresh organic soils (index values of 0.01-0.20) to more microbial-dominated organic matter in degraded mineral soils (index values of 0.50-2.50). The branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether composition is complex and is not immediately compatible with existing temperature transfer functions. Residence time within the active layer is interpreted to integrate key factors such as primary productivity, inorganic sediment delivery, and other climate factors that control soil organic matter degradation. The Marine Isotope Stage 3, mid-Wisconsin interstadial period at this locality was forest-dominated and suggests the currently prevailing tundra ecotone is sensitive to environmental change. The majority of buried permafrost OC is high in degradability and if thawed, would be expected to be highly vulnerable to microbial decomposition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Yangtze Platform in South China is considered a key site for studying Neoproterozoic ocean oxygenation. Comprehensive Cr concentration and isotopic signatures are presented from cap dolostones of the Doushantuo Formation from a deep water and a shallow marine carbonate section, that have previously been used to constrain the redox evolution of Ediacaran seawater in space and time employing major and trace element abundances as well as Sr-, O- and C-isotope compositions. The majority of the studied samples yield elevated Cr concentrations and negatively fractionated delta Cr-53 signals due to (i) detrital contamination consistent with Cr signatures of other post-Marinoan cap dolostones, (ii) diagenetic carbonate alteration and post-depositional remobilization of Cr. Al concentrations were used as indicator of detrital contamination and to calculate authigenic Cr concentration and isotope signatures when the detrital contribution of Cr was <40%, which generally resulted in slightly lower Cr concentrations and slightly higher Cr isotopic signals in these samples. Diagenetic alteration of a majority of the studied cap dolostones is evident from low Sr concentrations and light delta O-18(carb) signals that correlate with low Cr concentrations and negatively fractionated delta Cr-53 values. Post-depositional remobilization of Cr results in the loss of heavy Cr isotopes and consequently light Cr isotopes are retained during precipitation of secondary carbonates. However, some samples might still show pristine Ediacaran seawater signals. Two samples pertaining to the deep water cap dolostone section at Yanwutan and one sample pertaining to the shallow water section at Jijiawan yield slightly positively fractionated delta Cr-53 signals, particularly when corrected to presumably authigenic signals (delta Cr-53(auth)). These values are consistent with those from other Neoproterozoic carbonate sections deposited in an oxygenated environment. This short sequence of positively fractionated delta-53Cr(auth) is concurrent with a cap dolostone Sr-87/Sr-86 signal close to Ediacaran seawater values with relatively high Sr and Cr concentrations, with decreased detrital contamination and with a pronounced negative Ce anomaly. They indicate either light pulses of enhanced oxidative weathering or, inferred from a few least-altered samples, prevailing oxic conditions during cap dolostone deposition. The Cr isotopic composition of Ediacaran cap dolostones pertaining to the Doushantuo Formation reveals fine-scale fluctuations in post-glacial detrital contamination and diagenesis balanced against a clear signal of oxidative weathering. Cr isotopes have the potential to further enhance our understanding of Neoproterozoic weathering regimes and past ocean oxygenation, however, before the Cr isotope system can be faithfully applied to delineate changes in redox conditions recorded in ancient marine carbonates, possible diagenetic alteration of the Cr signal as well as Cr contribution from detrital contamination need to be taken into consideration.

AB  - In acidified aluminium (Al) rich freshwater positively charged Al-species (Al-i) are the key toxic components due to the accumulation in fish gills. As a countermeasure, liming is used to increase the pH and reduce the concentration of Al-i-species; in particular low molecular mass (LMM) Al-i-species by hydrolyses. However, very toxic high molecular mass (HMM) Al polymers can form in the unstable mixing zone immediately after liming. In the present work gill reactivity of LMM and HMM Al-species was studied under controlled conditions in eight channel-tank mixing zone systems in the field where Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) kept in cages were exposed to defined mixing zone water. Mixing zones were created by continually liming acid fiver water (pH 5.0-5.7) high in LMM Al-i to pH 6.0 and 6.4, respectively. Transformation processes affecting the Al-speciation as a function of time after liming were documented by in situ hollow fibre ultrafiltration interfaced with ion chromatography, while the Al accumulation in fish gills was used as bioindicator. For fish exposed to mixing zone water immediately after liming (1 min) the Al accumulation in gills (mu g Al g(-1)) was higher (factor of 2) than for fish exposed to acid water prior to liming, due to the fort-nation of gill reactive HMM Al-i-species. The Al accumulation in gills followed a first order kinetic expression reaching steady-state conditions after 24-h exposures. The deposition rate of Al in gills (mu g Al g(-1) h(-1)) correlated with the water concentrations of HMM Al-i (R-2=0.80) in the mixing zones, and for LMM Al-i in the acid water (R-2 =0.92). Due to the transient nature of HMM Al-i the deposition rate of All decreased from the point of liming with a factor of 10 downstream the channel-tank system (i.e. 100 min after liming). The concentration of gill accumulated Al was higher (factor of 3) immediately after high level liming (pH 6.4) than following low level liming (pH 6.0). However, high level liming was more efficient in detoxifying Al in downstream waters. Furthermore, the bioavailability of a given LMM Al-i concentration as well as bioreactivity following liming was dependent on the TOC and silicon concentration in the acid water. Increased concentration of TOC (1.5 to 4.3 mg l(-1)) and silicon (0.3 to 1.0 mg l(-1)) reduced the gill reactivity of Al-i by approximately 50%. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Titanite is an important U-Pb chronometer for dating geologic events, but its high-temperature applicability depends upon its retention of radiogenic lead (Pb). Experimental data predict similar rates of diffusion for lead (Pb) and oxygen (O) in titanite at granulite-facies metamorphic conditions (T = 650-800 degrees C). This study therefore investigates the utility of O-isotope zoning as an indicator for U-Pb zoning in natural titanite samples from the Carthage-Colton Mylonite Zone of the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Based on previous field, textural, and microanalytical work, there are four generations (types) of titanite in the study area, at least two of which preserve diffusion-related delta O-18 zoning. U-Th-Pb was analyzed by SIMS along traverses across three grains of type-2 titanite, which show well-developed diffusional delta O-18 zoning, and one representative grain from each of the other titanite generations. Type-2 and type-4 titanites show broadly core-to-rim decreasing Pb-206/U-238 zoning, consistent with Pb diffusion at higher temperatures, and uniform or even slightly increasing Pb-206/U-238 near grain rims, indicating subsequent recrystallization and/or new growth below the Pb blocking temperature. Type-2 and type-4 grain cores preserve ca. 1160 Ma ages that correlate with the anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite magmatic phase of the Grenville orogeny, whereas grain rims give ca. 1050 Ma Pb-206/U-238 ages that coincide with the culminating Ottawan phase. The type-3 titanite grain was sampled from a vein and yields Pb-206/U-238 dates older than the syenite into which the vein was emplaced; accordingly, its Pb-206/U-238 dates are interpreted as indicating excess uncorrected common Pb. Type-2 grains with recrystallized or shear-eroded margins show truncated or reversed Pb-206/U-238 zoning but retain symmetrically decreasing delta O-18 zoning, consistent with grain margin modification following arrest of Pb diffusion but before arrest of O diffusion. It is concluded that O diffusion was slightly faster than Pb diffusion in Adirondack titanites at the conditions of (local) peak Ottawan metamorphism, making delta O-18 zoning a useful discriminator of closed-system age domains that did not suffer Pb loss. In addition, the small offset in the O and Pb partial retention zones constrains the timing and temperature of oblique-slip deformation along the Carthage-Colton Mylonite Zone: the details of porphyroclast microstructure and zoning data show that the oblique-slip shear zones were active at ca. 1050 Ma, with deformation initiating near the peak of Ottawan metamorphism at similar to 700 degrees C and continuing through the O blocking temperature at similar to 550 degrees C.

AB  - The environmental constraints to agriculture imply that nitrogen (N) fertilizer management should be adjusted to crop N requirements determined by target yields. Nowadays for environmental and economical reasons target yield of farmers can be lower than the potential crop yields as permitted by soil and climatic conditions. So it is important to provide farmers crop N status diagnostic tools in order to decide the rate and the timing of N fertilizer applications. Theory on crop N uptake and allocation allows the determination of a diagnostic tool, the Nitrogen Nutrition Index, based on the determination of the critical N dilution curve for each crop species considered. During the vegetative growth period of all the crop species studied, including C3 and C4 species and monocots and dicots, plant N concentration decreases monotonically as crop grows because of (i) the ontogenetic decline in leaf area per unit of plant mass, and (ii) the remobilisation of N from shaded leaves at the bottom of the canopy to well illuminated leaves at the top. NNI appears then as an indicator well connected with the physiological regulation of N uptake at canopy level. So this indicator can be used as the basis for determination of crop N nutrition status, and then for decision making on the necessity of an N application for achieving target yield. Nevertheless despite its high physiological relevance, NNI cannot be used directly in farm conditions because its determination is very time consuming. So it is necessary to develop indirect methods for NNI estimation through more operational procedures. Several methods have been proposed in literature, such as nitrate concentration in sap or chlorophyll meter. But the calibration or validation of these methods with NNI have not been always made and, when they have been, they did not give univocal relationships, showing a strong dependence of the relationship with cultivar and environment, that limits considerably the relevance of such diagnostic tools in a large range of situations. Easier to use is the indirect estimation of crop NNI by remote sensing measurements. This method allows the estimation of both actual crop mass, through LAI estimation and crop N content, through crop chlorophyll content. The possibility to have repeated estimations of crop NNI during the period of vegetative growth would allow a dynamic diagnostic tool of crop N status. The coupling of indirect measurements of crop N status with dynamic models of crop growth and development should allow a very promising method for crop N diagnostics for decision tools in N fertilization.

AB  - Paleoredox conditions are commonly evaluated based on elemental proxies but, despite their frequency of use, most of these proxies have received little comparative evaluation or assessment of their range of applicability to paleomarine systems. Here, we evaluate 21 elemental proxies, including six proxies based on the C-S-Fe-P system (TOC, S, TOC/S, DOPT, Fe/Al, C-org/P), nine proxies based on trace-metal enrichment factors (Co-EF, Cr-EF, Cu-EF, Mo-EF, Ni-EF, Pb-EF, U-EF, V-EF, Zn-EF), and six additional proxies from Jones and Manning (1994) (U/Th, U-auth, V/Cr, Ni/Co, Ni/V, (Cu+Mo)/Zn), in 55 Phanerozoic marine formations. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to determine relationships among these 21 proxies in each formation and then sought to identify patterns across the full database. The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 40.1% of total dataset variance on average, with the highest median loadings on trace-metal enrichment factors (Ni-EF 0.82, Mo-EF 0.76, all nine >0.50). The next highest median loadings are on C-S-Fe-P proxies (TOC 0.58, DOPT 0.30, C-org/P 0.28), with bimetal proxies yielding uniformly lower loadings (Ni/Co 0.18, V/Cr 0.13). PCA of the factor loadings for the 55 study formations demonstrated associations among the 21 elemental proxies linked to specific sediment host phases: (1) an organic cluster associated with TOC, Mo, V, and Zn, (2) a uranium cluster associated with all U-based proxies, and (3) a sulfide cluster associated with S and Fe as well as the trace metals Co, Cu, Ni, and Pb (i.e., the major and typical minor constituents of diagenetic pyrite).
   The findings of the present study have important ramifications for use of elemental proxies for paleoredox analysis. First, all of the proxies examined here are influenced by environmental redox conditions to some degree, although the degree of redox influence on any given proxy can vary considerably from one formation to the next. Second, sedimentary enrichment of most proxies depends on the presence of specific mineral and organic host phases, and evaluation of elemental redox proxy data requires an understanding of how elements are partitioned among those phases. Third, no single proxy is a universally reliable redox indicator, although some are more consistently useful than others-notably, TOC and trace-metal EFs. Fourth, because of this inherent variability in proxy response, adoption of redox proxy thresholds established in earlier published studies is discouraged. Instead, we recommend that future redox studies establish redox thresholds on a formation-specific basis through internal cross-calibration of multiple redox proxies.

AB  - In many European countries Arnica montana is decreasing due to intensification or abandonment of traditional extensive land use and thus is considered endangered. In Romania the species is also decreasing due to excessive collecting for pharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes, but it is still relatively common in montane nutrient-poor grasslands and successional vegetation of forest clearings on acidic soil. In this study we analysed habitats and population structure of A. montana in the Romanian NE Carpathians. We asked for differences in population structure between habitat types and how population structure is related to environmental conditions. We investigated population structure and habitat characteristics in 25 populations of A. montana on three 1 m x 1 m-plots each (total of 75 plots). The plot-based assessment of the population structure included the numbers of rosettes (rosette density), flower heads (flower head density), flowering rosettes and flower stems per flowering rosette. From these variables we calculated the proportions of flowering and vegetative rosettes and the number of flower heads per flowering rosette. Habitats were characterised using climatic data (including elevation), land use types (grazing, mowing or abandonment), vegetation types, soil measurements (pH, several nutrient elements, organic matter content) and N supply on basis of plant indicator values. Vegetation types were defined by using hierarchical clustering and linked to phytosociological syntaxa based on diagnostic species. Observed habitat types included Mountain hay meadows, Species-rich Nardus grasslands and Alpine and subalpine heathlands according to the European Habitats Directive. DCA analysis was used for detecting floristic gradients, which were subsequently correlated to environmental conditions. Relationships between rosette density, proportion of vegetative rosettes, flower head density and number of flower heads per flowering rosette and environmental variables were assessed using GLMs. Five syntaxa with A. montana were identified: Festuco rubrae-Agrostietum capillaris nardetosum strictae, Scorzonero roseae-Festucetum nigricantis, Violo declinatae-Nardetum strictae, Cetrario-Vaccinietum gaultherioidis and Campanulo abietinae-Vaccinietum myrtilli. While vegetation composition was mainly correlated with altitude and soil variables such as pH and organic matter content, altitude was an important predictor for the proportion of flowering rosettes of A. montana, which decreased with altitude. Rosette density of A. montana varied between habitat types and was highest in Mountain hay meadows and lowest in plant communities dominated by tall plants with high cover. Organic matter content of the soil was the only important (negative) predictor for the number of flower heads per rosette, while a hump-shaped correlation was found between the density of inflorescences and the soil pH, with a maximum around pH 4.5. Grassland management was also an important factor for rosette density of A. montana, suggesting that maintaining and promoting traditional land use practices will be the most effective measure for the species' conservation.

AB  - Possibilities of fundamental science on fluid inclusions are discussed - the knowledge on mineral-forming environments (fluids) (thermobarogeochemistry-mineralfluidology-fluid inclusions) in the repconstruction of fluid environment of the mineral and petroleum genesis in the Earth's bowels. It is shown that in its naturally preserved relics-inclusions in minerals really reflect the processes of synthesis and genesis of natural hydrocarbons, migration of hydrocarbon fluids and their localization in oil-and-gas fields. Such phenomena, first of all, include occlusion of volatile mantle compounds H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, etc. by inclusions in minerals of submantle (mantle) genesis (mainly in diamonds) as "hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-forming (petroleum and petroleumforming) constituents". The analysis performed indicates that in minerals of the basic and ultrabasic rocks exactly carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons are a typomorphic sign of defects-inclusions. The predominance of deep-seated high-density CO2 in inclusions in olivine from nodules in basalt of Hawaii Island and Sudety (Poland) and from the bottom of the Indian Ocean determines the carbon dioxide nature of degassing in the asthenosphere and lower reaches of the lithosphere. This confirms the most important postulate of the geological-geochemical model of deep petroleum genesis that only compounds such as H2O and CO2 can be donors of Hydrogen and Carbon for the synthesis of hydrocarbons. From the materials of fluid inclusions research in deep minerals it follows that there are prerequisites for the formation of petroleum similar systems at high temperatures and pressures in the asthenosphere of the mantle of the Earth and their migration in the Earth's crust. Original authors experiences on this issue are realized in the new theory of synthesis and genesis of natural hydrocarbons: abiogenic-biogenic dualism, and a new model of mineral-naphthid genesis as well as a model of the evolution of deep fluids (by fluid inclusions) as a basis for the mineral-fluidological model of the Earth. This allowed us to justify the scheme of deep mineral-naphthid-genesis (synthesis of hydrocarbons and minerals) in the magma-lithosphere system in fault zones of the lithosphere in the environment of abiogenic high-termobaraic deep-seated fluid as one of the variants of the concept of polygenesis of natural hydrocarbons, suggest the schemes of migration processes in fluid-conducting fracturing zones and prove the conjugation of the migration processes of hydrocarbon fluids and formation of veinlet-impregnated mineralization: on the one hand, the formation of hydrocarbon deposits, on the other, the capture of hydrocarbon compounds in defect-sinclusions in minerals of veinlets. Thus, the identification of hydrocarbons in fluid inclusions helps to decide the fundamental problems of the origin of source substances for the mineral synthesis of hydrocarbons in the asthenosphere of the Earth's mantle as well as applied problems for the development of search and evaluation criteria for hydrocarbon raw materials (by genetic indicators), and, accordingly, new unconventional geotechnologies, which involves the search for combustible fossils simultaneously with the solution of the problem of synthesis and genesis of hydrocarbons at the atomic-molecular level fixed defects of the crystalline structure of minerals.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely present in natural surface water, and was found to be at the high level of mu g/L in the surface water around a BPA manufacturing plant. Mass production and application make BPA ubiquitous in the environment, biota and humans. As a two-dimensional carbon based nanomaterial, graphene oxide (GO) is used in many fields, and there is a great potential for GO to discharge to aquatic environment via various pathways. Thus GO has the potential to interact with organic pollutants, such as BPA, copresent in water system. GO could adsorb organic pollutants in water, and adhere on the surface of organisms, displaying different effects on the behaviors and toxicities of organic pollutants in organisms at different developmental stages. But the intrinsic mechanisms for the different effects remain unclear. To fill this gap, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was selected as a vertebrate model to investigate the toxicities of a variety of pollutants and nanomaterials in this study. Embryogenesis is an important growth phase in the zebrafish life cycle. Pollutants can induce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and generate a large number of oxidative intermediate products by destroying the balance between oxidation and antioxidation, thus causing oxidative damage. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) can catalyze the oxidation of superoxide anion (O-2(-)) to O-2 and H2O, in an attempt to maintain ROS at a physiological level and protect the body from damage. Catalase (CAT) exists primarily within peroxisomes and removes the H2O2 generated by the long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. Excessive ROS can attack the polyunsaturated fatty acids in the biomembrane system, resulting in lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the product of irreversible lipid peroxidation, and the change of MDA can reflect the level and damage degree of lipid peroxidation in organisms. Glutathione (GSH), as an important non-enzymatic antioxidant in organism, can be induced and effectively scavenged by external stimulation to regulate oxidative stress. Toxic effects occur in organisms when GSH is gradually reduced. This study focused on the joint effects of GO and BPA on the oxidative responses in zebrafish at early development stage. Zebrafish embryos were individually exposed to BPA (0, 50, 500 mu g/L), GO (0, 0.1, 1 mg/L), BPA+GO (50 mu g/L + 0.1 mg/L, 500 mu g/L + 0.1 mg/L, and 50 mu g/L+1 mg/L, 500 mu g/L+1 mg/L) solutions for 7 d. The levels of SOD, MDA, GSH, CAT, and ROS in the exposed zebrafish larvae were determined. The results indicated that BPA displayed strong oxidative damage effects on zebrafish larvae. However, the presence of GO distinctly alleviated the various indicators of oxidative damages caused by BPA. Based on analyses using the Bliss independence model, GO and BPA exhibited antagonistic effects on the oxidative damage of zebrafish in the early development stage, which indicated that GO could reduce the oxidative damage toxicities of BPA on zebrafish embryos under the experimental conditions. These could be due to the formation of a GO layer on the zebrafish embryos, which depressed the absorption of BPA by zebrafish, leading to reduced BPA accumulation in zebrafish in early developmental stage.

AB  - This study provides a description of the Devonian radiolarian associations of northern Eurasia and discusses their role in the evolution of Earth's biosphere. It contributes to evolutionary studies of the Earth and its organic world by reconstructing the diversity dynamics of the Devonian radiolarian biota and the chorology of its components, at the same time revealing the biostratigraphic and paleoecological potential of radiolarians. The taxonomic composition and characteristics of the dominant morphotypes in radiolarian communities are indicators of environmental conditions. Associations of radiolarians vary significantly between different, even neighboring, water areas, so they can be considered as ecozones. Data on the structure of associations of radiolarians at the level of taxa of higher rank (classes) are a kind of "certificate" or "passport" of ecozones of individual paleobasins. Radiolarian ecozones replace each other in time, which allows their use for biostratigraphy. The results of the new and revisional studies of the Devonian radiolarians from 15 regions of northern Eurasia enabled a refined and detailed radiolarian scale of the Devonian system and description of 39 Devonian radiolarian ecozones, 24 of which are described for the first time: 17 ecozones are recognized based on the literature data, while seven ecozones are based on analysis of new data. Of 39 ecozones, 33 are dated based on conodont data, and six are dated using the co-occurring foraminifers, ostracodes, and/or ammonoids. General patterns in the evolution of Devonian radiolarians of northern Eurasia are considered and discussed. Spherical porous Sphaerellaria distinctly dominated in the Devonian. A clear trend towards an eastward increase in the relative abundance of spongy and latticed morphotypes of Spumellaria is shown. Spiny Aculearia of the orders Fasciculata and Triangulata are found to have been widespread. The early evolution of the bilaterally symmetrical Albaillellata is recorded. It is shown that in the Famennian, radiolarians with a pylome, Popofskyellidae and Archocyrtiinae, were common, while the genus Caspiaza first appeared at that time. The habitats and the distribution of the discoidal and ellipsoidal radiolarian morphotypes are analyzed in space and time. The dominance of these morphotypes can be used as an indicator of shallow water settings and a marker of transgression and regression boundaries in the paleobasin. A model of cyclic deposition of Domanik-type rocks in an anoxic basin is proposed, and the ecology of radiolarians in the anoxic environments of the Middle Frasnian Domanik Paleosea is analyzed. The predominance of the spiny morphotypes over spherical radiolarians is proposed as a paleoclimatic coefficient indicating cooling of the seawater in a paleobasin. Devonian radiolarians are represented by indigenous species and migrant species: (1) the value of the settled index exceeds that of the migration index by 3-5 times, (2) radiolarians occupied new ecological niches by emigration of evolutionarily young species representing genera with one-two species in total. Four radiolarian migration episodes are established in the Famennian basins of Laurussia. The monograph is intended for widespread use in paleontology, biostratigraphy, paleoecology, paleobiogeography and for university courses.

AB  - Background: Circadian rhythms are biological rhythms generated by an organism or group of organisms that have an intrinsic period of 24 h. Among the many variables that exhibit circadian rhythmicity, body temperature has received considerable attention. The circadian rhythm of body temperature is a well-documented physiological phenomen. Also, it has been shown that changes in heat loss via convection and radiation are primarily caused by variations in skin blood flow, with consequent changes in skin temperature. For this reason, foot temperature assumes a great importance both as indicator of equine laminitis and foot-and-mouth disease in sheep. Particularly, the foot rot, term loosely used to describe lameness associated with the bovine foot, is characterized by acute inflammation of the skin and adjacent soft tissue of the interdigital cleft or space in which the modifications of temperature assume a great importance. In fact, the regulation of body temperature is an essential component of the process of fever, which plays an important role in an organism's response to infection and disease, and its manipulation is a standard procedure in various surgical and therapeutic procedures. In this regards, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of rectal temperature (RT) both in healthy Comisana sheep and in Comisana sheep affected by foot rot.
   Materials, Methods & Results: This experiment was carried out on 10 clinically healthy and not pregnant female sheep, and 10 not pregnant female sheep affected by foot rot. During the experimental period, all animals were kept under a natural photoperiod (sunrise 06: 30, sunset 19: 00). RT was measured every 3 h intervals for 24 consecutive hours starting at 11: 00 on day 1 and ending at 11: 00 on day 2. A trigonometric statistical model was applied to the average values of each time series, so as to describe the periodic phenomenon analytically, by characterizing the main rhythmic parameters according to the single cosinor procedure. Four rhythmic parameters were determined: mean level, amplitude (the difference between the peak, or trough, and the mean value of a wave), acrophase (the time at which the peak of a rhythm occurs), and robustness (strength of rhythmicity). The application of the periodic model showed a circadian rhythm of RT in healthy subjects and no circadian rhytmicity of RT was observed in ill sheep.
   Discussion: The analysis of the results obtained under experimental conditions used in the present study indicated the existence of a circadian periodicity of rectal temperature in healthy sheep whereas no circadian oscillations of rectal temperature were revealed in sheep affected by foot rot. A simple and coherent explanation for these pathological alterations is that the set point is elevated during the rising phase and returned to normal during the later phase. Taking together, the findings of the present study, along with those of others, emphasize the concept that RT exhibits a circadian rhythm that reflect the familiar circadian patterns of endogenous source and the existence of circadian oscillations around a set point with changes in mean body temperature and an absent rhythm when temperature is modified to a new set point, as observed in sheep affected by foot rot.

AB  - The carbon sink function of peatlands is the result of a relatively small imbalance between biomass production and decay and proposed to be sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Thus, peat decomposition plays a decisive role in determining the future carbon balances of peatlands under changing climatic conditions and increasing human pressure. To evaluate the effects of peatland degradation on the degree of decomposition in light of deviating site histories and to reveal interrelations between different indicators, we analysed peat depth profiles of physicochemical peat decomposition proxies across nine study sites in two valley bogs in the Eastern Alps, Austria. For this purpose, we divided 1 m peat cores sampled at the nine sites into 4 cm sections and analysed these peat samples for bulk density, loss on ignition, pH value, carbon and nitrogen content and ratio, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, and five humification indices based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, we regularly measured water levels and incubated litter bags over two years. Peat characteristics were found to be relatively homogenous across the treeless and only slightly degraded sites. At these sites, depth profiles followed similar patterns with strongly increasing decomposition in the uppermost layers and the highest degree of peat decomposition at 40-56 cm depths for most proxies. Thus, our findings suggest that even apparently only slightly degraded sites were distinctly affected by past drainages. In contrast to the open peat bog sites, the degree in peat decomposition was distinctly higher at tree-encroached sites and at long-term drained former peat-cutting sites. Both, the distinct difference in the degree of decomposition between the two peatlands and the inverse decomposition depth trends, i.e., more decomposed peat overlying less decomposed layers, highlight the importance of secondary decomposition on the depth profiles and the strong effects of site histories on the current degree of peat decomposition. The results of two-year litter bag incubations of four vascular plant species revealed distinct differences in species-specific litter decomposition rates and considerable differences for same species between the two investigated bogs. The strong interrelations between different humification indices underline the simultaneous effects of proceeding decay on the different chemical properties of the peat. Besides, humification indices were strongly related with other physical and chemical properties of peats and highest loadings on the principal component 1 that accounted for 41% of the total variance of the dataset were found for four different humification indices, bulk density and nitrogen contents. We conclude that the selective preservation of aliphatic, acid and aromatic groups during peat decomposition are well suited to elucidate small-scale differences in the degree of decomposition and to strongly interrelate with established indicators as bulk densities.

AB  - Parasitic nematodes of the genus Trichuris Roderer, 1761 are hematophagous helminths, capable of parasitizing many different hosts including humans. The domestic and wild ruminants are hosts of several Trichuris species, with Trichuris globulosa (Linstow, 1901) one of the most prevalent parasites found in cattle. The exogenous stages of the helminth's life cycle develop in the outer environment, and their activity and survival depend on the abiotic factors. Thus the aim of the work was to determine the influence of temperature on the rate and success of development of infectious eggs of T. globulosa in laboratory culture considering their morphological and metric changes. The results of experimental studies showed that the embryogenesis of T. globulosa eggs, cultured in laboratory conditions and obtained from gonads of female nematodes, occurs in six stages regardless of the temperature regime. At the same time, the rate of transition from one stage to another, the term for the formation of infectious eggs and their viability directly depends on the temperature of the external environment. At the optimal temperature for the development of T. globulosa eggs, 25 degrees C, 76.3% of eggs reached the mobile larva stage. A decrease in temperature to 20 degrees C and an increase to 30 degrees C led to an increase in the egg mortality of up to 26% and 32%, respectively, and the viability of eggs decreased. Under such temperature conditions, 74% and 68% of eggs of Trichuris reached the mobile larva stage. With an increase in the culture temperature, the time of embryogenesis decreased and amounted to 56 days at 20 degrees C, 48 days at 25 degrees C, and 32 days at 30 degrees C. Depending on the temperature regime, the zygote stage lasted from the release of eggs from the gonads of female nematodes to 12 days, the stage of blastomere formation from 4 to 12 days, the stage of the bean-shaped embryo from 8 to 24 days, the stage of the tadpole embryo from 16 to 36 days, the stage of larval formation lasted from 16 to 48 days, the stage of mobile larva from days 20 to 56. The formation of the infectious T. globulosa egg from a noninfectious one is shown in an experiment to include the metric changes confirmed by metric indicators. Mature eggs with a mobile larva are shorter and wider, with shorter and narrower plugs and a thinner shell than eggs at the zygote stage. The obtained research results on the influence of temperature on the exogenous development of Trichuris globulosa will make it possible to predict the epizootic situation of trichurosis in animal husbandry, as well as take timely measures to arrest the embryonic stages of nematode development in the external environment.

AB  - Mount (Mt) Elgon forest in western Kenya is important for biodiversity, environmental protection and socio-economic development. Characterizing forest conditions is essential for evaluation of sustainable management and conservation activities. This paper covers findings of a study which determined and analysed indicators useful in monitoring disturbance levels in the Mt Elgon Forest. A systematic survey was carried out and covered 305 plots of 0.02 ha and 250 smaller nested regeneration plots along 10 belt transects that were distributed in five blocks within the moist lower montane forest type. Collected and analysed data include types of disturbance, tree species composition, abundance and logged species. Correlation breakdown among disturbance types revealed that, paths were indicators of the number of tree harvesting sites (r(s) =1.00, P < 0.01) and of de-vegetated areas through grass harvesting (r(s) = 0.90, P = 0.04). Solanum mauritianum Scop. was an indicator of old-charcoal production sites. Logging targeted 13 tree species and harvested trees with diameter at breast height above 20 cm. The most exploited species were Olea capensis L. and Deinbolia kilimandscharica Taub. All exploited species had low regeneration but tree regeneration was not an effective indicator of logging.Resume
   La foret du Mont Elgon, dans l'ouest du Kenya, est importante pour sa biodiversite, pour la protection de l'environnement et pour le developpement socioeconomique. Il est essentiel de bien definir les caracteristiques de ses conditions pour pouvoir evaluer les activites de gestion durable et de conservation. Cet article reprend les resultats d'une etude qui a determine et analyse des indicateurs interessants pour pouvoir suivre le niveau de perturbation dans la foret du Mont Elgon. Une etude systematique fut menee, qui a couvert 305 parcelles de 0,02 ha et 250 plus petites parcelles de regeneration incluses le long de 10 transects de ceinture, distribuees en cinq blocs dans la foret humide de basse montagne. Les donnees recoltees et analysees comprennent les types de perturbation, la composition des especes d'arbres, leur abondance et celles qui sont exploitees. Une rupture de correlation parmi les types de perturbation a revele que les sentiers etaient des indicateurs du nombre de sites ouetaient recoltes les arbres (r(s) = 1.00; P < 0.01) et de zones sans vegetation a cause de la recolte de l'herbe (r(s) = 0.90; P < 0.04). Solanum mauritianum Scop. etait un indicateur d'anciens sites de production de charbon de bois. Les coupes d'arbres concernaient 13 especes dont le diametre a hauteur de poitrine depassait 20 cm. Les especes les plus exploitees etaient Olea capensis L. et Deinbolia kilimandscharica Taub. Toutes les especes exploitees avaient une faible regeneration, mais une regeneration d'arbres n'etait pas un indicateur fiable d'anciennes coupes d'arbres.

AB  - Brazilian beef cattle are raised predominantly on pasture in a wide range of environments. In this scenario, genotype by environment (GxE) interaction is an important source of phenotypic variation in the reproductive traits. Hence, the evaluation of GxE interactions for heifer's early pregnancy (HP) and scrotal circumference (SC) traits in Nellore cattle, belonging to three breeding programs, was carried out to determine the animal's sensitivity to the environmental conditions (EC). The dataset consisted of 85 874 records for HP and 151 553 records for SC, from which 1800 heifers and 3343 young bulls were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip. Genotypic information for 826 sires was also used in the analyses. EC levels were based on the contemporary group solutions for yearling body weight. Linear reaction norm models (RNM), using pedigree information (RNM_A) or pedigree and genomic information (RNM_H), were used to infer GxE interactions. Two validation schemes were used to assess the predictive ability, with the following training populations: (a) forward scheme-dataset was split based on year of birth from 2008 for HP and from 2011 for SC; and (b) environment-specific scheme-low EC (-3.0 and -1.5) and high EC (1.5 and 3.0). The inclusion of the H matrix in RNM increased the genetic variance of the intercept and slope by 18.55 and 23.00% on average respectively, and provided genetic parameter estimates that were more accurate than those considering pedigree only. The same trend was observed for heritability estimates, which were 0.28-0.56 for SC and 0.26-0.49 for HP, using RNM_H, and 0.26-0.52 for SC and 0.22-0.45 for HP, using RNM_A. The lowest correlation observed between unfavorable (-3.0) and favorable (3.0) EC levels were 0.30 for HP and -0.12 for SC, indicating the presence of GxE interaction. The GxE interaction effect implied differences in animals' genetic merit and re-ranking of animals on different environmental conditions. SNP marker-environment interaction was detected for Nellore sexual precocity indicator traits with changes in effect and variance across EC levels. The RNM_H captured GxE interaction effects better than RNM_A and improved the predictive ability by around 14.04% for SC and 21.31% for HP. Using the forward scheme increased the overall predictive ability for SC (20.55%) and HP (11.06%) compared with the environment-specific scheme. The results suggest that the inclusion of genomic information combined with the pedigree to assess the GxE interaction leads to more accurate variance components and genetic parameter estimates.

AB  - Maize production trials carried out in eastern middle of Germany from 1999 to 2009 were used for statistical analysis of the optimum date for silage maize ripeness. The knowledge about difference in ripeness between grain and residual plants at the harvest were used for exactly choice of cultivar under drought conditions for silage and energy maize:
   The Silage maize Ripeness Index (the ratio of dry matter content of maize grains to dry matter content of residual plants) is more suitable for the leading of plant development, the determination of harvest date and the choice of cultivar as the dry matter content of the whole plant. The analysis is cheaper as well as not so material and time-consuming with the better financially results in feed-, milk- and methane production in comparison to the dry matter content of the silage maize of different hybrid maize populations and environments.
   Basically, the harvest of silage maize to be carried out at the maximum possible ripeness index in all years, on every site, regardless of the variety to perform their silage maize ripeness number (SRZ), the heat sum and the calendar. The requirements for the varieties in the silo and energy maize are identical.
   The phenological ensilage optimum and yield maximum correspond with the physiological ripeness of silage maize and are close to the grain dry matter content of 63% and a ripeness index from 2.6 to 2.9 depending on quality and yield parameters. The maximum ripeness on the basis of SRI from greater than 2.9 at physiological ripeness grain to be exceeded. Only under these conditions it is possible to reach the optimal ripeness of 30-35% in the whole plant silage maize (22-24% dry matter in the stover).
   The wide ripeness ratio between grain and stover is multifunctional guarantor for the better plant health, for example with regard to the zearalenone and carotene content, the resource efficiency of fertilizer-N in accordance with the yield-related N denials and soil stocks in N as well as basic product safety and sustainability of the procedure of silage maize.
   The Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI) is, for whole plant maize, better than the Silage maize Ripeness Number (SRZ) for the choice of a hybrid in Germany. The dry matter content of grain in relation with the dry matter of residual plants are better than dry matter content of the whole plant maize as ripeness indicator in the production of silage and energy maize at the harvesting time. SRI is also universal suitable for use as a standard in scientific trials and for better characteristic of cultivar types and environmental influence universally appropriate and multifunctional.

AB  - This paper presents some new concepts in the petroleum systems of the northern Labrador and southern Baffin Island offshore region of eastern Canada. The focus of this work is the region of the Hekja O-71 gas discovery of 1979 by Aquitaine, one of only five wells drilled between 1976 and 1980 within an area covering some 166,000 square kilometers within the Saglek Basin.
   This study emerged from a broad scale re-examination of the petroleum potential of this area "from the crust up" using regional reflection, refraction and potential field data. An opportunity to use SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data from the RADARSAT-1 Earth observation satellite was taken to incorporate alternative data sources to support this exploratory review and resource assessment.
   Examination of the final map of interpreted slick-like features on the sea surface, revealed a close correlation of some of these occurrences to several bathymetric features which have underlying seismic signatures similar to previously identified gas hydrate "pipes" or chimney anomalies as seen in data from offshore Nova Scotia and in the Irish Sea. Globally, many active marine hydrocarbon seeps appear on the seafloor as "pockmarks"; in this case no seafloor depressions were seen on conventional multi channel 2-D seismic data associated with active seepage. Instead, very distinct mound-like structures are seen associated with seeps at two locations east of Hudson Strait. The presence of significant cold water coral in close proximity to the active seepage sites may show a link between seafloor petroleum seepage and coral reef development similar to that observed offshore Norway.
   Close examination of the near surface seismic character led to the interpretation of what was originally seen as seismic noise in vintage data, as likely being fluid escape chimneys or gas pipes, along the eastern edge of the Hekja structural complex, where favourable hydrocarbon trapping conditions are present.
   No active seeps were seen there; this may be due to other factors, such as the nature of the fluids that are escaping or the possibility of self sealing activity by biological agents such as bacterial matting with associated carbonate hard-ground formation.
   One seep anomaly was noted relatively close to the major basaltic eruptive complex near the Gjoa G-37 well. This may be due to the presence of volcaniclastic- hosted hydrocarbons similar in style to those recently discovered at the Rosebank field in Paleocene volcanics in the Faroe-Shetland Basin. The occurrence of an active seep in a volcanically-dominated terrain raises the potential for a radical shift in accepted types of petroleum leads and where they may occur.
   The presence of apparent oil seepage versus the past history of finding only gas-prone accumulations is a strong indicator that a second, oil-prone petroleum system exists in the Saglek Basin. The signs of active petroleum systems as shown by oil seep anomalies with confirming seismic evidence of discrete sea floor structures in close proximity makes a compelling argument for re-examining these areas with an eye towards stratigraphic instead of structural plays.

AB  - The core interval of 0-140 m of the 357-m-long pollen record from site Funza-I was analysed using multivariate analysis. This long continental record is from the high plain of Bogota, located at 2550 m altitude in the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia. Time control is based on a visual match with core Funza-II from the same location, which includes absolute fission-track ages, and a match with the delta(18)O record of ODP Site 677. We reassessed the time-frame of Funza-I compared with previous papers, and conclude that the period of ca. 650-25 kyr BP is represented.
   In this study 73 fossil taxa, present in > 4% of the 409 pollen assemblages, were analysed using the divisional classification program TWINSPAN. We recognised 10 cluster types that form three main cluster zones: W (warm), CW (cool) and C (cold). Pollen zones based on previous visual inspection were compared with new cluster types, which were graphed as a bar code along the pollen diagram. The use of two pollen sums (standard pollen sum, and a zonal pollen sum) appeared useful for identifying local effects on the forest composition. Modern pollen rain data for the study area were summarised. We used the concept of indicator taxa that behave as differential taxa to reconstruct climatic change.
   During the period of 650-330 kyr BP, Alnus, Hedyosmum, Weinmannia, Melastomataceae, Myrica and Podocarpus were the most important taxa of the Andean forest. The new time-frame indicates that the first scattered presence of Quercus started 478 kyr BP (102 m core depth), the first continuous presence was from 423 kyr BP (92 m), and the presence of zonal Quercus forest occurred from 330 kyr BP (72 m). During the period of 330-135 kyr BP, zonal Quercus and Weinmannia forest developed, replacing partly Podocarpus-dominated forest in the uppermost Andean forest belt. As a consequence, during the last 135 kyr BP, a high representation of Quercus on the high plain of Bogota no longer coincides with warm climatic conditions, but now occurs during cool to cold conditions. The pollen record was correlated with the delta(18)O record: temperature drop during Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 4 and the very first part of Marine Oxygen Oxygen Stage 2 is calculated as a minimum of 6.6 degrees to 7.8 degrees C (excluding a potential effect of low glacial pCO(2)). The inferred maximum amplitude of the upper forest line during the last 650 kyr was from ca. 1900 to 3400 m (cf. 3200 m at the present-day), corresponding to a range of ca. +1.2 degrees C to -7.8 degrees C compared with today.

AB  - The response of microbial biomass carbon (C-mic), nitrogen (N-mic), basal respiration, and the metabolic quotient to 3 years of a natural succession fallow were studied in a field experiment on sandy soil in Northeast Saxony/Germany from 1996 to 1998. Soil samples were taken from Eutric Cambisol and Mollic Cambisol every six weeks during the vegetation period at soil depths of 0-10 and 1030 cm. The C-mic content in the topsoils increased with time of succession in both soil types. This trend was more distinct in the Mollic Cambisol (70.7 mug g(-1) in June 1996 to 270.9 mug g(-1) in October 1998 at 0-10 cm) than in the Eutric Cambisol (69.7 mug g(-1) in June 1996 to 175.0 mug g(-1) in October 1998 at 0-10 cm). By contrast, the Nmic content slightly decreased in the Eutric Cambisol from 18.9 mug g(-1) to 17.7 mug g(-1) during the same time period. In the Mollic Cambisol, the N-mic increased froth 18.8 mug g(-1) in spring 1996 to 35.5 mug g(-1) in fall 1998, however to a lower extent than the C-mic. Subsequently, the (C:N)(mic) ratio increased from 4.3 to 5.8 at soil depth of 0-10 cm and from 3.5 to 6.5 at 10-30 cm during the 3-year-study at the Eutric Cambisol. In the Mollic Cambisol, the enhancement of (C:N),;, ratio was more pronounced (i.e, from 4.3 to 6.7 at 0-10 cm and from 3.5 to 7.2 at 10-30 cm). Most likely this results from a shift in microbial populations towards a dominance of soil fungi. The already low basal respiration of, on average, 0.26 mg CO2 g(-1) (24h)(-1) (0-10 cm) in June 1996 decreased with time of succession fallow to 0.15 and 0.22 mg CO2 g(-1) (24h)(-1) in October 1998 in the Eutric and the Mollie Cambisol, respectively. Thus, the metabolic quotient as an indicator for the efficiency of organic matter turnover in soil was very low in both soils. During the summer months, the metabolic quotients reached minimum levels of less than or equal to 0.1 mug CO2 C (g C-mic)(-1) h(-1), probably because of low soil moisture contents. Correlation analyses revealed close relationships between N-mic and total N, N-mic and water content, and N-mic, and pH values. These relationships became even more pronounced with the time. period of natural succession. For the samples from fall 1998, highly significant correlations were determined between N-mic and total N (coefficients were r(s) = 0.91***), N,; and water content (r(s) = 0.91***), and N-mic and pH value (r(s) = 0.76***). The values for all biological parameters studied were larger in the Mollic than in the Eutric Cambisol. This indicates higher turnover rates of different C and N fractions in the Mollie Cambisol. In general, set aside of formerly agricultural managed sandy soils resulted in greater C-mic : N-mic ratios and thus, in a change in the microbiological community structure as well as in reduced C and N turnover rates (i.e. low metabolic quotient) under the climatic conditions of the East German lowlands.

AB  - The occurrence of shock metamorphosed quartz is the most common petrographic criterion for the identification of terrestrial impact structures and lithologies. Its utility is due to its almost ubiquitous occurrence in terrestrial rocks, its overall stability and the fact that a variety of shock metamorphic effects, occurring over a range of shock pressures, have been well documented. These shock effects have been generally duplicated in shock recovery experiments and, thus, serve as shock pressure barometers. After reviewing the general character of shock effects in quartz, the differences between experimental and natural shock events and their potential effects on the shock metamorphism of quartz are explored. The short pulse lengths in experiments may account for the difficulty in synthesizing the high-pressure polymorphs, coesite and stishovite, compared to natural occurrences. In addition, post-shock thermal effects are possible in natural events, which can affect shock altered physical properties, such as refractive index, and cause annealing of shock damage and recrystallization. The orientations of planar microstructures, however, are unaffected by post-impact thermal events, except if quartz is recrystallized, and provide the best natural shock barometer in terms of utility and occurrence. The nature of planar microstructures, particularly planar deformation features (PDFs), is discussed in some detail and a scheme of variations in orientations with shock pressure is provided. The effect of post-impact events on PDFs is generally limited to annealing of the original glass lamellae to produce decorated PDFs, resulting from the exsolution of dissolved water during recrystallization. Basal (0001) PDFs differ from other PDF orientations in that they are multiple, mechanical Brazil twins, which are difficult to detect if not partially annealed and decorated. The occurrence and significance of shock metamorphosed quartz and its other phases (namely, coesite, stishovite, diaplectic glass and lechatelierite) are discussed for terrestrial impact structures in both crystalline (non-porous) and sedimentary (porous) targets. The bulk of past studies have dealt with crystalline targets, where variations in recorded shock pressure in quartz have been used to constrain aspects of the cratering process and to estimate crater dimensions at eroded structures. In sedimentary targets, the effect of pore space results in an inhomogeneous distribution in recorded shock pressure and temperature, which requires a different classification scheme for the variation of recorded shock compared to that in crystalline targets. This is discussed, along with examples of variations in the relative abundances of planar microstructures and their orientations, which are attributed to textural variations in sedimentary target rocks. Examples of the shock metamorphism of quartz in distal ejecta, such as at the K/T boundary, and from nuclear explosions are illustrated and are equivalent to that of known impact structures, except with respect to characteristics that are due to long-term, post-shock thermal effects. Finally, the differences between the deformation and phase transformation of quartz by shock and by endogenic, tectonic and volcanic processes are discussed.
   We confirm previous conclusions that they are completely dissimilar in character, due to the vastly different physical conditions and time scales typical for shock events, compared to tectonic and volcanic events. Well-characterized and documented shock effects in quartz are unequivocal indicators of impact in the natural environment.

AB  - Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of lake sediment records have been greatly facilitated by statistical comparisons with microfossil assemblages from the surface sediments of modern lakes. These modern sub-fossil assemblages from different lakes, which are often referred to as "training-sets", attempt to incorporate gradients of environmental parameters, such as e.g., temperature and phosphorus, are of interest for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. One major assumption of quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions requires that the environmental variable to be reconstructed is, or is linearly related to, an ecologically important determinant in the ecological system of interest, and that the joint distribution with other variables in the fossil set is the same as in the training-set. The motivation for this paper is that present-day diatom species abundances in surface-sediment samples are often influenced by several environmental gradients. Partial least squares (PLS) or weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression methods can be used to adjust species optima, if the additional PLS components, which are orthogonal to previous PLS components, are included.
   This paper tests a reproducible approach for reducing the influence of background variables within a diatom training-set to produce a "screened" training-set, which focuses on the variable of interest. In our example total phosphorus (TP) is the variable of interest. The initial training-set consists of modern Swiss lakes along an elevation gradient spanning 2005 m (334 to 2339 m a.s.l.), which follows a TP gradient from 522 to 3 mu g L(-1). However, high-elevation lakes are not distributed equally along the TP gradient. They are meso-oligotrophic because high-elevation eutrophic lakes are rare in Switzerland. This leads to a potential confounding effect between the elevation and the nutrient gradients. These higher elevation lakes were selectively excluded, using Monte Carlo permutation tests, until the conditional effect with respect of covariables of elevation was no longer significantly related to the relative abundance of diatoms. The initial and screened inference models for log TP were applied to fossil assemblages from varved sediments at Greifensee (Switzerland), which cover the past century. The evaluation of. the reconstructions with measured TP (1954-1994) demonstrates that the smaller (screened) subset performs better than the larger, more heterogeneous, initial data-set when the same number of components are included. The slope of the relation between measured and inferred log TP changed significantly for the reconstructions using partial least squares, with one and two components, and for reconstruction using weighted averaging partial least squares with two components. According to our interpretation, the accuracy of the reconstructions improved because modern diatom abundances of the smaller subset are controlled mainly by log TP and lakes are more equally distributed along the log TP gradient. This approach of reducing the influence of background variables is applicable to other heterogeneous training-sets, such as merged training-sets, in order to homogenise the background variables and to maintain the gradient of interest.

AB  - We revisited questions about changes in the incidences of functional wood anatomical traits through geologic time and compared the incidences of these traits in the fossil record with modern wood anatomical diversity patterns in order to test classical ("Baileyan") and more recent ecophyletic hypotheses of xylem evolution. We contrast patterns through time for tropical and higher (paleo) latitudes. Data are from the InsideWood database. There are striking differences between woods from high and mid latitudes versus tropical (paleo)-latitudes. At temperate and subtropical latitudes (Laurasia and high latitude Gondwana), the epoch by epoch time series supports the Baileyan transformation series of vessel-bearing woody angiosperms (basal woody angiosperms and eudicots): "primitive" features such as scalariform perforations, exclusively solitary vessels, apotracheal diffuse parenchyma and heterocellular rays abound in the Cretaceous and become much less frequent in the Cenozoic, especially post-Eocene. In contrast, in the paleotropics hardly any changes occur in the incidences - each epoch has an equally "modern" spectrum of wood anatomical attributes. Although climatic gradients from the poles to the equator were less steep in the Cretaceous than in the late Cenozoic, the wood anatomical differences between mid-high latitude woods and tropical woods were much more pronounced in the Cretaceous than in later epochs. This seeming paradox is discussed but we cannot resolve it.
   We suggest that tropical conditions have accelerated xylem evolution towards greater hydraulic efficiency (simple perforations), biological defense and hydraulic repair (elaborate paratracheal parenchyma patterns) as evidenced by late Cretaceous tropical latitude woods having near modern incidences of almost all traits. At higher paleolatitudes of both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere "ancestral" features such as scalariform perforations were retained in cooler and frost-prone regions where they were not selected against in mesic habitats because of lower demands on conductive efficiency, and could even be advantageous in trapping freeze-thaw embolisms. The fossil wood record remains too incomplete for testing hypotheses on the wood anatomy of the earliest angiosperms. The low incidence of so-called "xerophobic" woods sensu Feild with scalariform perforations with numerous (over 40) closely spaced bars in the Cretaceous tropical fossil record is puzzling. At higher paleolatitudes such woods are common in the Cretaceous.
   Ring porosity, an indicator of seasonal climates and deciduousness, occurs at low levels in the Cretaceous and Paleogene at higher paleolatitudes only, and reaches modern levels in the Miocene. In Neogene and Recent temperate Northern Hemisphere, wide vessels are virtually restricted to ring-porous woods. In the tropics, there is a low incidence of ring porosity throughout all epochs.
   The fossil record indicates that ecophysiological adaptation to tropical or temperate conditions was already evident in the Cretaceous with considerable latitudinal differences.

AB  - Topsoil removal to incremental depths (TSD) under field conditions is a useful technique to simulate erosion, and assess its on-site impacts on soil properties and agronomic productivity. As the sustained productivity of the soils of US Cornbelt is threatened by topsoil loss due to erosion, the artificial soil removal and addition methods can help in assessing the on-site impact of soil erosion under natural field conditions. Thus this study was conducted in an Alfisol at Waterman Farm of The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio with the objective to assess the impact of long-term (13 years) effects of TSD treatments (removal of 20 cm topsoil, undisturbed soil and addition of 20 cm of top soil) with two amendments (organic manures and synthetic fertilizer) on particulate C fractions, and C associated with different size fractions. Application of organic or inorganic amendments to the eroded soil improved bulk density (BD) (1.57 Mg m(3)), water stable aggregates (WSA) (87%) and mean weight diameter (MWD) (3.18 mm) equivalent to undisturbed or soil addition treatments. However, the eroded soil had significantly lower total organic carbon (TOC) concentration (16.3 g kg(-1)) compared to other treatments. A trend of higher TOC and nitrogen (TON) concentration was observed with manuring compared with the use of synthetic fertilizer. The lowest concentration (2.66 g kg(-1)) of particulate organic carbon (POC) was measured in eroded soil, and it was 2.6 and 2.4 times lower than those of undisturbed and soil addition treatments, respectively. The sub-soil (15-30 cm) accumulated significantly lower POC (3.6 g kg(-1)) compared to the topsoil (0-15 cm) (7.0 g kg(-1)), with no difference among two amendments. The POC and N pools were also significantly lower in the eroded soil than in other treatments. The particulate organic C/N ratio was significantly larger in sub-soil (20.78) than surface soil (17.83), suggesting strong contribution of roots and root-derived products to POC. There was a positive correlation of macroaggregates C (>2 mm and 0.25-2 mm) with concentration of POC (0.58*, 0.41*) and PON (0.54**, 0.37*). The non particulate organic carbon (NPOC) pools increased with long term management, and were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.74**) with the TOC concentration. Higher stratification ratio for total and non particulate C and N was observed in undisturbed and soil addition treatments. Higher ratios (>2) of POC and PON in eroded treatments indicated the buildup of uncomplexed coarse organic residues of intermediate decomposition with higher turnover rate, and their positive impact on restoring the structural properties with the long-term use of amendments.

AB  - One of the aims of this work is to describe how the target variable "tree vitality" in terms of needle loss is affected by other explanatory variables. To describe such a relationship in a realistic way, we use generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) which allow to take spatial correlation of the data into account and in addition allow the inclusion of explanatory variables as predictors with the possibility of having non-linear effects. The GAMMs are fitted in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Data are available for two years 1988 and 1994. We select a set of best explanatory variables from a large set of variables including tree-specific variables, such as species, age, nutrients in the needles and site-specific variables such as altitude, relief type, soil depth and content of different nutrients in the top soil. In the two models for 1988 and 1994, different sets of explanatory variables were selected as best predictors. In both models, the effects of explanatory variables allowed a plausible interpretation. For example, the site-specific variables such as relief and soil depth were significant predictors, since these factors determine how well water and nutrient supply is balanced at a specific site. The selected sets of explanatory variables differed between 1988 and 1994, giving an indication of a possible change in the main causes of forest deterioration between 1988 and 1994. From the set of nutrient variables measured in the soil and in the needles, in 1988 altitude a.s.l. and magnesium supply were among the explanatory variables, in 1994 a combination of Al in the soil and the N/K-ratio (in the needles) was selected in the model. In 1988 altitude a.s.l. was among the most important predictors in the model. This is in contrast to 1994 where altitude was not selected. This may have to do with the fact that in the early phase of forest health monitoring (1988) one of the main causes of forest deterioration was magnesium deficiency. Later on this may have changed to a combination of soil acidification and nitrogen eutrophication. Thus by using an adequate model such as the GAMM, sets of explanatory variables for needle loss may be identified. By fitting two GAMMs, with different sets of "best" predictors, at two time points 1988 and 1994, we can detect changes in these sets of "best" predictors over time. This allows us to use the monitoring data with the tree vitality indicator crown condition/needle loss as a tool for forest health management, which may involve decisions about concrete counter measures like e.g. forest liming.

AB  - Carbon and sulfur preserved in estuary and shelf sediments play a critical role in controlling sediment diagenesis related to the global biogeochemical cycle. Their ratio (C/S = 2.8) in mud sediments has been widely used to distinguish freshwater from marine environments; however, this ratio can be influenced by depositional evolution, physical reworking, and other sedimentological parameters. We present a new C/S ratio data set from surface sediments of five rivers (Aojiang, Feiyunjiang, Jiaojiang, Oujiang, and Qiantangjiang Rivers), as well as core sediments offshore of the Oujiang Estuary (core EC2005, 60 m), to discuss how the evolution of the depositional environment influenced carbon and sulfur preservation since the last deglaciation. To this aim, we measured the contents of total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (TS), and carbonate in the collected samples. Our results demonstrate that a C/S ratio of 2.8 can effectively separate freshwater environments (river sediments and core sediments deposited before 13.1 ka), suggesting the initial impact of sulfate-enriched seawater on carbon and sulfur perseveration at similar to 13.1 ka. However, the TS content is independent of the TOC content after 13.1 ka, implying that pyrite sulfur is derived not only from organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR) but also from sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) under anoxic diagenetic conditions. In the shallowest core section (shallower than 5 m; < 1.5 ka), the C/S ratios gradually increase from 1 to 2.8, which corresponds to an interval with sulfide reoxidation under suboxic conditions caused by strong physical reworking. When the sediment is buried to a certain depth (deeper than 5 m; > 1.5 ka), a high sedimentation rate is conducive to an AOM reaction, resulting in the generation of a large amount of pyrite and finally causing the minimum value of the C/S ratio to be approximately 1. However, during the transitional period of 13.1-11.0 ka, sediments deposited in the tidal environment show overlap with those deposited in the marine shelf environment, and C/S ratios decrease from >10 to similar to 1. In addition, we propose that C/S and C/N ratios could be combined to reveal the depositional evolution from terrestrial to marine environments, which is sensitive to sea level and climatic changes. Therefore, our new findings suggest that the sedimentation process can modulate the diagenetic path of mud sediments (e.g., OSR versus AOM), and geochemical indicators of environmental evolution should be carefully used in combination with sedimentological parameters in shallow depositional environments.

AB  - In tropical and semitropical regions, raising broiler chickens out of their thermal comfort zone can cause an added economic loss in the poultry industry. The cause for the deleterious effects on immunity and growth performance of broilers under high environmental temperatures is still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of the current investigation was to evaluate the effect of heat stress on leukocytes protein synthesis and immune function as a possible direct cause of low performance in broiler chickens under such condition. In this study, 300 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Cobb500 (TM)) were randomly assigned into 2 groups with 5 replicates of 30 chicks each. From 21 to 42 days of age, one group was exposed to non-stressed condition at 24 A degrees C and 50% relative humidity (control group), while the other group was exposed to heat stress at 35 A degrees C and 50% relative humidity (HS group). At 42 days of age, blood samples were collected from each group to evaluate stress indicators, immune function, and leukocytes protein synthesis. Production performance was also recorded. Noteworthy, protein synthesis in leukocytes was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited in HS group by 38% compared to control group. In contrast, the phosphorylation level on threonine 56 site (Thr(56)) of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF2), which indicates the suppression of protein translation process through altering the protein elongation phase, was significantly threefold higher in HS group than in control (P < 0.05). In addition, an increase in stress indicators was markedly (P < 0.05) presented in the HS birds by twofold increase in heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and threefold increase in plasma corticosterone level compared to control. Furthermore, the immune function was significantly (P < 0.05) suppressed in HS birds than control (0.99 vs. 1.88 mg/mL plasma IgG, 89.2 vs. 148.0 mu g/mL plasma IgM, 4.80 vs. 7.20 antibody titer against SRBC, and 1.38 vs. 3.39 stimulation index of lymphocyte proliferation in HS vs. control group, respectively). Moreover, results on the broiler performance indicate that HS birds had a significant (P < 0.05) lower body weight gain by 58%, lower feed consumption by 39%, higher conversion ratio by 27%, and higher mortality by more than three times, compared to control birds. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the inhibition of leukocyte protein synthesis through increasing the level of eEF2 Thr(56) phosphorylation may play a key role in the observed decrease in immune function and growth performance with the high mortality rate encountered in broiler chickens under heat stress environment.

AB  - We present a multi-proxy, postglacial paleorecord from Chase Lake, a 1.63-km(2) drainage lake in northern Maine. This record, along with published paleorecords from several smaller lakes and hollows allow us to synthesize a long-term natural history of the area. Northern Maine is unique in the northeastern USA as it was the last part to be deglaciated and has maintained a relatively cold climate and boreal flora. The diverse lake/catchment sites differed in dates of deglaciation (13,700 to 13,200 cal yr BP) and the duration of the ensuing tundra period (1700 to 2900 cal yr). A dry. cold climate slowed plant establishment. Chase Lake had low aquatic productivity until the end of the tundra period. The Chase record shows that afforestation began similar to 10,600 cal yr BP, similar to 1000 years after the end of the Younger Dryas, and 700-1400 years later than at the other sites, and was completed by 9200 cal yr BP. Initial open woodlands of Picea (spruce) (largely P. mariana [Black Spruce]), Abies balsamea (Balsam Fir), Larix laricina (American Larch), Pinus (pines), Betula papyrifera (Paper Birch), and Populus (poplars) gradually became closed forest. Climate substantially warmed at the outset of afforestation. Despite evidence of an increasingly wetter climate, as indicated by rising water levels at 2 seepage lakes, fire was common for the first 2000-3000 years of woodland and forest history, probably enabled by summer droughts. This fire period is not matched in intensity and duration later in the paleorecords. At Chase, afforestation was accompanied by an increase in insect remains including microlepidopteran defoliators, and these remained abundant for the rest of the record. Major increases of aquatic biota accompanied afforestation. Spruce greatly decreased by similar to 7500 cal yr BP as northern hardwoods and Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) increased, but hemlock abundance remained low compared to farther south in the Northeast. From 7500 to 1300 cal yr BP. temperate tree taxa were at maximum abundances. Spruce and fir were at postglacial minima 6250-4400 cal yr BP. A relatively dry period 5300-3300 cal yr BP nearly eliminated hemlock at the outset. when it was replaced largely by Fagus (beech). Hemlock's partial recovery late in that period was accompanied by increasing Thuja (cedar) and decreasing Quercus (oak), the beginning of climate cooling and resumption of wetter conditions. This climate trend intensified after 3300 cal yr BP, resulting in further increases of cedar. spruce (largely Picea rubens [Red Spruce] and Black Spruce) and fir, which reached greatest postglacial abundances in the most recent 1000-1500 years. Long-term natural histories of selected woody taxa provide insights on ecological factors accounting for changes in species abundances. For example, the flourishing of cedar in the late-Holocene could have been abetted by increasing winter severity that eliminated Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer), heavy browsers on cedar. The geochemical history of the Chase catchment demonstrates ongoing weathering and depletion of several metals, resulting in enrichment of soils with silica. Several changes in metal concentrations are linked to afforestation, including increased transport to the lake sediment of Ca, K, Al. Fe. Cu, and Zn in/on increased organic detritus. Accumulation rates of metals and organic materials in the Chase Lake sediment were probably heavily influenced by physical processes including catchment erosion, shifts in sediment sources, and in-lake focusing.

AB  - The Farmdale-Sangamon Geosol pedocomplex consists of the Sangamon Geosol and the overlying Farmdale Geosol, which form the most extensive terrestrial record of the last interglacial to glacial transition in the Midwest United States. The geosol complex formed for upwards of 100 ka. extending from the end of MIS 6 through 4 for the Sangamon Geosol. then the Farmclale Geosol for during a brief episode at the end of MIS 3 following slow accumulation and pedogenic modification of eolian silt deposited on top of the Sangamon Geosol. Our study site consists of a buried paleo-hillslope transect that forms a catena, enabling evaluation of slope effects on interglacial-scale soil formation. The Sangamon Geosol is formed in calcareous and illitic glaciogenic sediment. Along the catena the Sangamon Geosol profiles display some morphological changes. namely in terms of colors that we interpret as indicators of differences in drainage Most thickness and horizonation characteristics are similar all along the transect. with intact upper sola horizons (AE and E horizons) that overlie clay-enriched Bt horizons The Bt horizons contain abundant clay that exists as illuvial clay coatings, matrix infills, and as mosaic-speckled domains The clay originated both by in situ weathering and through illuviation from the clay depleted upper sola. Slope does not appear to affect Bt characteristics beyond redder hues of the matrix and clay coatings in the upper slope position With depth, effects of carbonate leaching and infilling of clay in the matrix decrease and clay coatings are restricted to walls of voids adjacent to aggregates. Clay mineralogy shows illite depletion, but no interstratified kaolinite-expandable minerals. indicating the degree of weathering is not as great as is typical of Sangamon Geosol profiles formed in loess or in glaciogenic sediment of the central Illinois type area. Clay mineralogy is also stratified with depth, coincident with particle size. which probably indicates sorting of layers of illitic dolomite and shale. Variation of horizon and profile characteristics appears to largely be a function of particle size variability and stratification than topographic position in the catena. 1 lie influence of hillslope position on soil redistribution during formation of the Sangamon Geosol appears negligible given the uniformity of upper solum horizon thickness and sandy particle size characteristics, so we conclude that a bioturbation and rainwash origin of the upper solum and the texture contrast in these profiles is not the best process model explanation We suggest that the base-rich nature of these soils led to ecosystem characteristics that discouraged erosion and encouraged infiltration and a lessivage-type origin of the texture contrast No convincing evidence of MIS 6 through MIS 4 loess occurs at this site. The Farmdale Geosol formed in the Robein Silt, which is Roxana Silt (MIS 3 loess) that was redistributed downslope. The Robein Silt is thicker and finer in the topographic low and indicates the cooler and forested envionmental conditions during MIS 3 were conducive to downslope movement of soil and also produced greater differences in drainage-induced soil morphological changes in the Farmdale Geosol.

The aim of our work was to apply two trophic indices (F-p ratio and the trophic index TRLX) for assessment, of the trophic state of the coastalsea., in areas not directly affected by anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, and in the coastal waters near underwater sewage outfall and fish farms.
   Materials and Methods: Salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and fluorescence profiles were determined in situ using a CTD fine-scale probe. Concentrations of inorganic nutrients were measured on unfiltered water samples using standard colorimetric methods. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of pigments in the water samples were determined using a reverse-phase HPLC method equipped with serially coupled spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric detectors, The F-p ratio was calculated as described by Claustre (10) using pigment concentrations. The trophic index TRIX was calculated as described by Vollenweider et al. (1).
   Results: At the reference site the values of the F-p ratio varied between 0.09 and 0.96 (0.55+/-0.23). F-p followed a typical seasonalpattern. Higher annual mean values were calculated for the near bottom layer. At the reference site we calculated TRIX values in a range 3.02-6.39 (4.66+/-0.64). There was also a clear difference between layers above 15 m and layers near the bottom i.e. 20 m and 24 m. In the areas near the underwater sewage outfalls the F-p values were in arange from 0.15 to 0.80 (0.49+/-0.16) while the TRIX values were in a range from 2,58 to 6.51 (4.71+/-0.60), At the fish farm area the F-p ratio ranged from 0.13 to 0.59 (0.28+/-0.12). The TRIX values at same area ranged from 2.43 to 6.17 (5.16+/-0.69). The correlation between the two different indices was very low and varied seasonally. Neither with TRIX nor F-p we were able to discriminate between background conditions at the reference location and the two impacted areas. During the period of homogeneous water column higher values of both indicators of the trophic state were calculated for the areas affected by anthropogenic nutrient enrichment compared to the reference site, During the stratification of the water column we calculated higher values of trophic indices for the surface layer at the sewage outfall areas compared to the reference site where higher values were calculated for the middle and bottom layers.
   Conclusion: Our calculations classify the Gulf of Trieste as a moderate eutrophic area, The two indicators of the trophic state are complementary. When the natural seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in the studied areas is well known then calculation of both indices is suggested for indicating the trophic state of the coastal sea, We suggest that Chl a degradation products be incorporateded a new TRIX trophic index as an indication of the physiological status of the phytoplankton community.

AB  - Sales of electric cars and vehicles (EVs) have recently been showing a rapidly growing trend. In connection with rising electricity prices as well as social pressure on the environmental impacts of electromobility, there is also increasing interest of EV owners in the ecological source of electricity. The largest group of owners of EVs are residents of family houses, so, logically, they focus their attention on the possibility of using photovoltaic (PV) charging systems for EV charging. The design of the PV system for supporting EV charging is problematic due to several input parameters in the calculation of energy needs and due to the inconsistencies of electricity generation with normal electric vehicle (EV) charging time. While the PV system produces electricity during the day, family homeowners require charging EVs mainly at night. This requires batteries as part of a PV system. The optimal design of the PV of the battery system must take into account the real consumption of EV, the average daily distance traveled, the location, the weather bridging time, and, last but not least, the investor's financial situation. The timing mismatch of electricity needs and generation may result in the oversizing or sub-scaling of the PV system depending on the time period for which the investor claims full coverage. With an average daily EV consumption of 10 kWh/day, the overproduction of electricity may be at 8620 kWh per year if it is required to fully cover PV systems in January. Conversely, for the installation of PVs for full coverage in August, the year-round electricity deficit will be 1500 kWh per year. For the analyzed geographical conditions, i.e., Latitude 48.8, the optimum performance of PV system for one-day electricity storage is 3.585 kW. This corresponds to the full coverage of EV consumption in March, the price of the whole system varies from EUR 9000 to EUR 20,000 depending on the type of battery. In addition to the battery price, the required accumulation time for electricity to overcome adverse weather increases the required performance of a photovoltaic system (PVS), which again results in system overshooting and financial loss by not using the generated electricity. This cycle of interdependencies is usually very difficult to adjust optimally. In the contribution, we analyzed the mutual relationships of calculating the performance of a PVS according to the daily consumption of EV and required time of overcoming adverse weather. The input data for the analyses were normal average EV consumption and the number of daily km traveled from 10 to 100 km/day scaled to 10. The optimization process consisted of determining the necessary performance of the PVS and its production in the event of a requirement to ensure full energy demand in each month. In addition, different types of batteries that influence the investment price enter into optimization analyses. This depends on the energy density of a given battery, the depth of discharge, capacity, and type. The result of this research is a computational model for determining a new indicator-we called it the monthly deviation factor. This indicates the degree of oversizing or undersizing of the PV system in relation to the stated factors.

AB  - Background. Preparation of the new European REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of CHemicals) regulation on chemicals has reached a critical stage. Depending on how key elements of the legislative proposal are finalised, especially that on authorisation of uses of 'substances of very high concern', REACH could either provide an effective measure to drive innovation towards cleaner and safer alternatives, or instead lead to further avoidable chemical exposures on the basis of demonstrated 'adequate control' of risks. Given that some key indicators of human and wildlife reproductive health continue to decline in parts of Europe, while evidence for chemical exposure as a contributory factor grows, it will clearly be vital to get the legislation right.
   Goal and Scope. Whereas there is now a consensus between the European Parliament and Council of the European Union that uses of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substances should only be permitted when no safer alternatives are available, major differences remain regarding the manner in which other 'substances of very high concern' (including substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMRs) and endocrine disruptors) are addressed. This paper examines those differences in more detail and proposes some ways forward.
   Methods. Using case studies of specific chemicals as examples, the paper critically evaluates the concepts of 'effect thresholds' and 'adequate control' of risks, which underpin the Council's proposal for many CMRs and endocrine disruptors.
   Results. The subjectivity and uncertainties inherent in the threshold approach proposed by the Council, as illustrated by these case examples, bring its ability to ensure a high level of protection for the environment and human health into question: i. the nature and extent of toxic effects recorded depend on many different factors, including the type of test and conditions selected, the organisms exposed, the timing of exposure and precisely which effects are measured and over what timeframe. ii. doses considerably below 'no effect levels' for survival could nevertheless be causing significant impairment to health and/or reproductive success. iii. chemicals present in mixtures at levels below established thresholds for effects may, in combination, induce significant toxicological responses.
   Discussion. Under the Council's current proposal, companies will be granted authorisations for some uses of CMRs and endocrine disruptors, even if safer alternatives without these properties are already on the market. The high level of evidence required for identification of substances as being of equivalent concern represents an additional weakness in the Council approach.
   Conclusions. Instead, a requirement (along the lines of the Parliament's proposals) to address the availability of alternatives in all cases, to use them when available and to initiate their development when not, represents a more robust, defensible and protective approach to the management of 'substances of very high concern'. The possibility for authorisation of essential uses would remain, while all avoidable uses and exposures would progressively be prevented and sustainable innovation supported.
   Perspectives. In the long run, this can only lead to a more sustainable future for the chemical industry in Europe, as well as delivering benefits of increased protection for our environment and health for generations to come.

AB  - Previous studies of foliar cold tolerance in red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) have been conducted on isolated shoots or needles. These studies therefore could not show either the type or amount of visible injury to attached foliage in a natural environment after controlled freezing stress, or the physiological response, if any, of visibly undamaged foliage. It was hypothesized that even when visible injury did not develop, foliage on frozen, attached branches would show long-term alterations in electrolyte leakage, water balance, and gas exchange capacity as a result of severe freezing stress. In mid-December 1990, intact, attached branches of red spruce saplings which had been exposed to controlled ozone levels (1 x or 2 x ambient) and precipitation acidity (pH 3.1 or 5.1) were frozen to -48 or -54-degrees-C. Neither ozone nor precipitation acidity affected any measure of freezing injury at P less-than-or-equal-to 0. 1. During the 3 months following freezing, current-year shoots developed either a brown needle discoloration, needle abscission without visible discoloration, or no obvious needle discoloration or abscission. This is the first experiment to show that severe freezing stress can lead to abscission of visibly undamaged needles from an attached branch. All frozen current-year needles had elevated relative electrolyte loss (REL) with 24 hr after freezing, but REL subsequently declined for needles without visible discoloration. One day after freezing, average relative water con tent (RWC) of needles on frozen and unfrozen shoots was about 85%, and RWC remained above 80% throughout the winter for unfrozen shoots. By mid-january, needle RWC on visibly injured shoots averaged about 50% RWC of experimentally frozen needles without visible injury fell more slowly to between 65 and 76% by late February. Across all shoot types, REL just after freezing was negatively correlated with needle RWC 1 month later, and also with maximum dark respiration (R), conductance to water vapor (g), and light-saturated net photosynthesis (A) measured on detached shoots at 12-20-degrees-C in late january to February. In unfrozen shoots, net photosynthesis reached a maximum of about 5 mumol m-2 s-1. Shoots with visible needle injury and shoots from branches which later showed needle abscission had very large reductions in mean maximum gas exchange (>50% for R, > 60% for g, and > 90% for A) compared to unfrozen shoots. On frozen branches which retained needles, non-visibly injured shoots had declining dark respiration rates and reductions of about 40% in maximum conductance and net photosynthesis, suggesting physiological damage from the freezing stress despite a lack of visible needle injury.  Net photosynthesis and conductance remained lower in non-visibly injured frozen shoots compared to unfrozen shoots in late March and early April, more than 3 months after freezing. Initial net photosynthesis of frozen shoots placed in the growth chamber in late january was strongly correlated with maximum net photosynthesis. Initial net photosynthesis divided by initial conductance (A(i)/g(i)) was even more strongly correlated with maximum net photosynthesis (r = 0.95).  A(i)/g(i) was also negatively correlated with visible needle injury estimated in late March.  A(i)/g(i) measured on detached shoots, under favorable conditions for photosynthesis, may therefore be an early indicator of either latent visible needle injury or reduced photosynthetic capacity for freeze-damaged trees.

AB  - Organic farming practices recommended by European regulations offer an alternative to conventional soil management, but these practices should be analyzed in greater depth to assess their effectiveness on different plants and in different local conditions. Accordingly, this study evaluates the efficacy of five different organic management strategies on an organic plum farm in Southeastern Spain. This study was conducted for a period of six years and the five different organic treatments were applied in triplicate in 256 m(2) plots randomly distributed in three blocks (15 plots in total); each plot had 16 plum trees. Every year crushed pruning wastes were incorporated into the soil in all the experimental plots. One triplicated plot only received this aforementioned treatment (crop biomass treatment, CB). The rest of the plots also received one of the following treatments: (i) the addition of a commercial product for organic agriculture based on bacteria (biofertilizer), composed of Azospirillum brasilense (bacteria fixing N) and Pantoea dispersa (bacteria with a capacity for solubilising phosphates and stimulating plant growth) (biofertilizer treatment, B); (ii) the annual addition of 20 t/ha of certified commercial organic compost (annual compost treatment, AC); (iii) the biennial addition of 20 t/ha of certified commercial organic compost (biennial compost treatment, BC); and (iv) the sowing and subsequent incorporation of a mixture of 60% Avena sativa and 40% Vicia sativa (green manure treatment, GM). Each year the following indicators of ecosystem sustainability related to soil microbiological characteristics and carbon fixation were measured after harvest, in addition to plum yield: organic carbon (C-org), water soluble C, humic substances and humic acid C, microbial biomass C, respiration, ATP, dehydrogenase activity and hydrolase enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, urease and beta-glucosidase) activities. The two way ANOVA of the results indicated that all the above parameters were significantly affected (p <= 0.001) by both, treatment and time. The interaction of treatment and time also significantly affected all of these parameters, except for yield and dehydrogenase activity. Composts not only produced better results than green manure cover crops and biofertilizer treatments in terms of plum yields, but they also brought about higher increases in the soil C pool and greater improvements in soil microbiological characteristics. In the six years of the study, compost-treated soils showed higher average plum yields and higher organic carbon, humic substance and humic acid contents than the rest of treatments. The size and activity of microbial population was also greater in the compost-treated soils, reflected in the higher values found in these soils for microbial biomass C, soil respiration, ATP (adenosine-tri-phosphate) content and dehydrogenase and hydrolases activity. Nevertheless, yields when compost was added biennially (BC) tended to be higher than in the annual compost treatment (AC) in most years as well as on average, although the differences were usually not significant. Yields in the sixth crop showed a high positive correlation with soil humic substances and humic C content (p <= 0.01), as well as with C-org, microbial biomass C and phosphatase and urease activity (p <= 0.05).

AB  - Aim Intraspecific variation in patch occupancy often is related to physical features of a landscape, such as the amount and distribution of habitat. However, communities occupying patchy environments typically exhibit non-random distributions in which local assemblages of species-poor patches are nested subsets of assemblages occupying more species-rich patches. Nestedness of local communities implies interspecific differences in sensitivity to patchiness. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain interspecific variation in responses to patchiness within a community, including differences in (1) colonization ability, (2) extinction proneness, (3) tolerance to disturbance, (4) sociality and (5) level of adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions. We used data on North American mammals to compare the performance of these 'ecological' hypotheses and the 'physical landscape' hypothesis. We then compared the best of these models against models that scaled landscape structure to ecologically relevant attributes of individual species.
   Location North America.
   Methods We analysed data on prevalence (i.e. proportion of patches occupied in a network of patches) and occupancy for 137 species of non-volant mammals and twenty networks consisting of four to seventy-five patches. Insular and terrestrial networks exhibited significantly different mean levels of prevalence and occupancy and thus were analysed separately. Indicator variables at ordinal and family levels were included in models to correct for effects caused by phylogeny. Akaike's information criterion was used in conjunction with ordinary least squares and logistic regression to compare hypotheses.
   Results A patch network's physical structure, indexed using patch area and isolation, received the greatest support among models predicting the prevalence of species on insular networks. Niche breadth (diet and habitat) received the greatest support for predicting prevalence of species occupying terrestrial networks. For both insular and terrestrial systems, physical features (patch area and isolation) received greater support than any of the ecological hypotheses for predicting species occupancy of individual patches. For terrestrial systems, scaling patch area by its suitability to a focal species and by individual area requirements of the species, and scaling patch isolation by species-specific dispersal ability and niche breadth, resulted in models of patch occupancy that were superior to models relying solely on physical landscape features. For all selected models, unexplained levels of variation were high.
   Main conclusions Stochasticity dominated the systems we studied, indicating that random events are probably quite important in shaping local communities. With respect to deterministic factors, our results suggest that forces affecting species prevalence and occupancy may differ between insular and terrestrial systems. Physical features of insular systems appeared to swamp ecological differences among species in determining prevalence and occupancy, whereas species with broad niches were disproportionately represented in terrestrial networks. We hypothesize that differential extinction over long time periods in highly variable networks has driven nestedness of mammalian communities on islands, whereas differential colonization over shorter time-scales in more homogeneous networks probably governed the local structure of terrestrial communities. Our results also demonstrate that integration of a species' ecological traits with physical features of a patch network is superior to reliance on either factor separately when attempting to predict the species' probability of patch occupancy in terrestrial systems.

AB  - A peat bog in the Jura Mountains, Switzerland, provides a continuous record of peat accumulation since 12 370 C-14 yr BP. Periods of enhanced soil dust deposition (10 590 C-14 yr BP, 8230 C-14 yr BP, and after 5320 C-14 yr BP) are characterized by strongly elevated Ti/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios which imply an increase in the abundance (both relative and absolute) of heavy minerals such as ilmenite and zircon. With respect to trace elements such as Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sb and Au, the M/Sc ratios are at their lowest, and often approach crustal values, during periods of enhanced soil dust deposition. The lowest rates of atmospheric deposition of soil dust date from 8030 to 5320 C-14 yr BP, corresponding to the Holocene climate optimum, but here many trace elements exhibit their greatest natural enrichments: the average enrichment factor (calculated using Sc as the reference element, and normalizing to crustal abundance) was Zn 4.1 +/- 1.4, Sb 4.8 +/- 1.4, Cu 8.8 +/- 3.3, As 14.9 +/- 3.2, Au 53.9 +/- 25.1, and Cd 357.4 +/- 53.8. These enrichments cannot be explained by chemical diagenesis within the deeper sections of the peat profile during or subsequent to peat formation, but rather reflect the chemical composition of airborne material supplied to the surface layers of the bog at the time of deposition. The enrichments of trace metals in ancient peats, relative to crustal abundance, most likely reflects the natural enrichment of these elements in the fine fraction of soils during rock weathering. Periods of enhanced soil dust deposition such as the Younger Dryas cold climate phase (10 590 C-14 yr BP) are characterized by reduced vegetation cover, greater exposed soil surface, and higher wind strengths; these conditions promote the transport of locally derived soil materials of greater particle size, lower concentration of trace metals, and M/Sc ratios approaching crustal values. During the Holocene climate optimum, vegetation cover was extensive, and with lower wind strengths and a reduction in erodible soil materials, long range transport of soil dust became relatively more important to the soil dust inventory of the bog; soil dust particles in this size class are characterized by strong enrichments of a wide range of trace elements. At the end of the Holocene optimum, dust fluxes increased once again, due mainly to soil erosion resulting from the combined effects of human activities (tillage) and the climatic deterioration at the beginning of the Neoglaciation Period; this promoted the supply of local, more coarse soil particles with M/Sc ratios approaching those of crustal rocks. While biological cycling and volcanic emissions probably also contributed to the atmospheric supply of many of these elements in the pre-anthropogenic past, these contributions appear to be less important than the chemical weathering, physical fractionation, and atmospheric transport of soil dust particles.

AB  - The endoparasite, Perkinsus marinus, is one of the primary factors affecting the abundance and productivity of populations of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. The environmental and biological factors that control the prevalence and infection intensity of P. marinus were examined with a coupled oyster population-parasite model. The simulations show that food availability to the host and temperature control on the growth and developmental rates of the host and parasite are the environmental factors that regulate the parasite. In addition, a feedback between the density of the parasite in the host and the parasite's division rate partially controls infection intensity.
   Simulations that use summer temperatures typical of temperate estuaries show increased parasite growth rate which results in more of the net production of the oyster population going to reproduction, thereby reducing the ability of the oyster to outgrow the parasite. As a result, disease prevalence and infection intensity are maximal during the summer throughout the range of environments tested with the model. The simulations suggest that oyster mortality from P. marinus, as a fraction of the adult population, may be most pronounced for mid-latitude systems. The increased reproductive potential of oyster populations living at lower latitudes balances increased mortality from disease. Thus, disease prevalence and infection intensity average higher in the simulated populations that correspond to the central part of the latitudinal range of the oyster.
   The timing and magnitude of food supply for the oyster greatly affects the degree of mortality produced by the parasite in the simulated populations. In the early spring, the oyster has not switched to a reproductive mode, and more of the net production goes to somatic tissue development. Hence, if increased food is available in the early spring (a March to April spring bloom), mortality due to the parasite decreases in the simulated oyster population. The simulations suggest that the primary defense for the oyster is to simply outgrow P. marinus.
   The simulated oyster populations remain at moderate to moderately heavy infections for extended periods during the summer for two reasons. First, increasing density of the parasite results in a decreased rate of parasite division, which decreases the rate of oyster host mortality. Second, the rate at which infected individuals reach a lethal infection level is slowed enough that less heavily-infected oysters grow up to replace those that die. These simulation results show that, unlike many host-parasite systems, high infection rates in oysters do not necessarily result in high host mortality. The simulations further suggest that the rates of P. marinus division and mortality must vary regionally among oyster populations and that some lability in disease resistance by the oysters must be present.
   The results from the oyster population-P, marinus model imply that environmental changes, such as temperature variability, which may result from climatic effects, can potentially alter the prevalence and infection levels of the parasite in oyster populations. Sensitivity of the host-parasite system to the recent history of environmental change provides a mechanism for exaggerating the effects of extreme years, such as times of reduced food supply or extended periods of warm temperature. Thus, any management strategy for diseased oyster populations must take into account environmental conditions, the physiology of the oyster and the parasite, as well as the previous history of the disease in the population.

AB  - Peroxidation of lipids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acid residues (PUFA) of phospholipids and cholesterol esters, is a process of marked implications: it shortens the shelf-life of food and drugs, it causes fragmentation of DNA, it damages cellular membranes and it promotes the genesis of many human diseases. Much effort is therefore devoted to a search for "potent antioxidants", both synthetic and from natural sources, mostly plants.
   This, in turn, requires a reliable, simple, preferably high throughput assay of the activity of alleged antioxidants. The most commonly used assays are based on measurements of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of a solution, as evaluated either by determining the rate of oxidation of the antioxidant or by measuring the protection of an easily determined indicator against oxidation by the antioxidants.
   The commonly used assays utilized for ranking antioxidants share three common problems:
   (i) They usually evaluate the effects of those antioxidants that quench free radicals, which constitute only a part of the body's antioxidative network, in which enzymes play the central role. (ii) Both the capacity and potency of antioxidants, as obtained by various methods, do not necessarily correlate with each other. (iii) Most estimates are based on methods conducted in solution and are therefore not necessarily relevant to processes that occur at the lipid-water interfaces in both membranes and micro emulsions (e.g. lipoproteins).
   Given this "state of art", many researchers, including us, try to develop a method based on the formation of hydroperoxides (LOOH) upon peroxidation of PUFA in lipoproteins or in model membranes, such as liposomes. In these systems, as well as in lipoproteins, the most apparent effect of antioxidants is prolongation of the lag time preceding the propagation of a free radical chain reaction. In fact, under certain conditions both water soluble antioxidants (e.g. vitamin C and urate) and the lipid soluble antioxidant tocopherol (vitamin E), promote or even induce peroxidation.
   Based on the published data, including our results, we conclude that terms such as 'antioxidative capacity' or 'antioxidative potency' are context-dependent. Furthermore, criteria of the efficacy of antioxidants based on oxidation in solution are not necessarily relevant to the effects of antioxidants on peroxidation in biological systems or model lipid assemblies, because the latter processes occur at water/lipid interfaces.
   We think that evaluation of antioxidants requires kinetic studies of the biomarker used and that the most relevant characteristic of 'oxidative stress' in the biological context is the kinetics of ex vivo peroxidation of lipids. We therefore propose studying the kinetics of lipid-peroxidation in the absence of the studied antioxidant and in its presence at different antioxidant concentrations. These protocols mean that antioxidants are assayed by methods commonly used to evaluate oxidative stress. The advantage of such evaluation is that it enables quantization of the antioxidants' efficacy in a model of relevance to biological systems. In view of the sensitivity of the lag time preceding peroxidation, we propose studying how much antioxidant is required to double the lag observed prior to rapid peroxidation. The latter quantity (C-2lag) can be used to express the strength of antioxidants in the relevant system (e.g. LDL, serum or liposomes). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We conducted complementary linear and non-linear statistical modelling of the first 20 years of hydrochemical data from the 22 lakes and streams of the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN) in order to assess temporal patterns and rates of change in indicators of the key drivers of surface water acidification and acidity status. Over the period 1988-2008, concentrations of non-marine sulphate (i.e. of anthropogenic origin) fell in line with reductions in non-marine sulphur deposition, the principal driver of acidification. Most of the decline was confined to the latter half of the 1990s. Whilst these reductions were substantial, concentrations in recent samples from the most contaminated sites remained several times higher than those in the most remote, low-deposition regions. Nitrate (NO3-) concentrations also declined slightly at several sites in northern England and Wales, possibly reflecting a recent regional reduction in N deposition. Further north, NO3- concentrations increased slightly in some Scottish sites, reflecting a continued dominance of climatic variation on nitrogen cycling in this region. A combination of unusually high rainfall and seasalt inputs in the early years, gradual long-term reductions in hydrochloric acid deposition, and later and more substantial reductions in sulphur deposition, appeared to account for relatively linear increases in an alkalinity-based estimate of Acid Neutralising Capacity ([AB-ANC]) with time. However, variation between sites in the size of the long-term trend in [AB-ANC] was most clearly linked to the size of the long-term reduction in sulphate concentration.
   The chemical characteristics of changes in [AB-ANC] across the network were dependent on rates of change in acid deposition, the extent to which sites have previously acidified, and average dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]). In the most acidified waters, the response in acidity to reductions in acid deposition was dominated initially by large reductions in inorganic aluminium concentrations ([Al-inorg]. Responses in pH have become clearer at these sites as [Al-inorg] has begun to stabilise. Over the wider network, pH has been rising more rapidly in sites with lower concentrations of organic acids. A substantial proportion of the deposition-driven increase in [AB-ANC] at several sites is accounted for by increases in [DOC]. For the non-acidified but acid-sensitive waters in the far north and west, changes in [DOC] represent the only clear response to the small changes in sulphur deposition.
   In the more acidified sites, a reduction in the size of occasional extreme concentrations of Al-inorg, that occur after periods of high rainfall or seasalt deposition events, has been more rapid than the declines in average levels, implying that at most sites the persistence of these events should not be seen as an additional barrier to ecological recovery. In a comparison of geographically paired sites with forested and moorland catchments, consistently higher levels of inorganic aluminium concentration and lower AB-ANC provided clear evidence that the former group had acidified to a greater extent. There were few significant differences in the rate at which non-marine sulphate concentration declined or AB-ANC increased and the forested sites therefore remain in a more acidified condition.

AB  - Background: Nowadays horse transportation represents an increasingly practice as a greater number of horses are subjected to transport for several purpose including sport competitions, breeding and selling. In the past, horses were usually transported by train and ship however, at the present time, they move mainly by road with trailers or vans. Transport represents a potential stressor that might compromise horse performance therefore, the chance to monitor horse welfare during transportation is of great interest. The autonomic nervous system and its regulation of cardiovascular function have been considered suitable indicators of stress and welfare in humans and animals. Measuring the vagal tone provide a best knowledge about stress vulnerability and the magnitude of a stress response. Considering that heart rate (HR) represents the effect of the vagus, the aim of this study was to evaluate if this parameter is an affordable indicator of stress in horses subjected to different experimental conditions concerning the duration and the time of the day of road transportation.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Twelve clinically healthy athletic Italian Saddle horses, divided into three equal groups, were transported over two different distances (110 Km and 225 Km) at the same time of the day (5.00 pm) (group A and B), and over the same distance (110 Km) during the evening (5.00 pm) and during the morning (8.00 am) (group A and C). Each journey was divided into 3 parts (T1, T2, T3) on the basis of road characteristics: T1 and T3 periods represented the time spent travelling on secondary roads characterized by several changes of direction and average speed of 35-40 Km/h; T2 was travel duration on nearly completely rectilinear motorways with average speed of 70 Km/h. Mean HR recorded at rest for each horse was 38 +/- 3 beats/min. On HR values recorded during transportation one-way ANOVA showed significant statistical differences of HR values in T2 vs T1 and T3 periods within the group A (P < 0.0001) and C (P = 0.003); no significant statistical difference was found in T1, T2 and T3 periods within group B. T tests showed that mean HR values were lower in group B than in group A, and higher in group C than group A only in T2.
   Discussion: Even if transport includes a series of potential stressors such as handling, loading, unloading, unfamiliar environments, oscillation and vibration of the mean of transport, noise, social regrouping, poor ventilation, deprivation of both food and water; in the present study our recordings showed that HR changed irrespective of the experimental characteristics of the journey including the different duration of each transportation. We found that neither the average speed of the mean of transport or the characteristics of the road determined significant changes in horse HR. We also found no influence of the time of the day on HR trend during transportation in horses. This might be due to the fact that HR varied when posture and other external stimuli changed during transport masking the biological rhythms that usually affect the cardiovascular activity and the HR diurnal variability that suits the needs of different levels of activity at different time of the day. On the basis of these results, HR seemed to be an extremely variable parameter profoundly affected by the temporary responses of the horses to sudden environmental incidents.

AB  - The Zhuonai Lake and Lunpori oil shale, located in the central Tibetan Plateau, were deposited in a Tertiary lacustrine environment in the Hoh Xil and Lunpola Basins, respectively. A combined investigation of sedimentary, organic geochemistry, and organic carbon isotope was performed to define source rock potential, the palaeoenvironment, and source of the organic matter. Three types of facies sequences are developed in the Zhuonai Lake section and oil shale mainly occurs in the oil shale-marl sequence. The oil shale-silty claystone and oil shale-marl facies sequences are developed in the Lunpori section. Both oil shales are finely stratified especially for the Lunpori oil shale with thickness of the laminae about 10 mu m which contains abundant pyrite crystals and fossilized fish bones.
   Both the Zhuonai Lake and Lunpori oil shale contain high values of total organic matter (TOC). S-2, and hydrogen index (HI), indicating the oil shales have good oil source rock potential. T-max values show an immature stage of organic matter for the Zhuonai Lake oil shale and thermally marginally mature for the Lunpori oil shale because of difference in their burial history. Lunpori oil shale shows the characteristics of amorphous organic matter (AOM) dominance, odd-over-even predominance, maximum n-alkanes peak at nC(25) or nC(23), higher proportion of C-29 sterane, light delta C-13(org) values (-30.0%. to -27.4%.), high concentrations of phytane (Pr/Ph ratio ranging from 0.02 to 0.18), high values of gammacerane index (up to 25.26), and presence of beta-carotane, which are consistent with a reducing, stratified, and hypersaline palaeo-lake with main contribution of algae and bacteria to the organic matter (OM). Oil shale samples from the lower and upper part of the Zhuonai Lake section are characterized by low H/C ratios and high O/C ratios, amorphous humic OM and vitrinite dominance, odd-over-even predominance with long-chain n-alkanes dominance, heavy organic carbon isotope, and C-29 > C-22 sterane distribution, in agreement with a main contribution of land plant. The heavy organic carbon isotope suggests the expanding of C-4 land plant during the early Miocene. While the most samples show characteristics of AOM dominance, maximum peak at nC(29) or nC(31), and high C-27 sterane concentration, consistent with a main contribution from algae to the OM. The Pr/Ph ratio cannot be applied as a measure for redox conditions in the section because of maturity effects. Biomarker analysis indicates that the salinity during the deposition of the Zhuonai Lake oil shale was not enhanced. The Oligocene Lunpori oil shale and the Early Miocene Zhuonai Lake oil shale recorded the variation of palaeolimnological water chemistry. The development history of the palaeo-lakes from the Oligocene saline to the Early Miocene fresh water reflects the variation of palaeoclimate from dry to humid in the central Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Although generally rare in natural aquatic systems, cobalt concentrations can be elevated through ore and coal mining operations and discharges of certain textile dyes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not have an ambient water quality criterion for cobalt due to a lack of toxicological data. The present study determined whether freshwater acute and chronic cobalt toxicity were dependent on dilution water hardness. We specifically examined the relative toxicity of cobalt at high water hardness (greater-than-or-equal-to 200 mg/l as CaCO3) because cobalt often occurs in carbonate ores. Acute and chronic toxicity tests using both Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas were performed using four different synthetic waters: 50, 200, 400, and 800 mg/l hardness as CaCO3. Diluent hardness appeared to have no effect on measured cobalt concentrations. Dissolved cobalt in water samples during testing was similar to the corresponding total recoverable cobalt in this study suggesting that most of the cobalt was in a soluble and presumably bioavailable form. LC50 values for P. promelas could not be calculated owing to their low sensitivity to high cobalt concentrations (greater-than-or-equal-to 5 mg/l) over a 48 h period. Regression analysis of P. promelas acute NOEC values and test water hardness indicated an R2 = 0.94 suggesting a direct relationship between water hardness and acute toxicity to cobalt for this species. C dubia acute tests indicated water hardness effects after 48 h of exposure and non-linear dose responses in hard water (greater-than-or-equal-to 200 mg/l). Regression analysis of C dubia 24 h LC50 values and test water hardness indicated an R2 = 0.91. For both cases, a simple power function gave the best regression fit. C. dubia appeared to be more sensitive than P. promelas at hardness greater-than-or-equal-to 200 mg/l but the reverse was true in soft water (less-than-or-equal-to 50 mg/1). The 7 d P. promelas chronic NOEC increased from 1232-mu-g/l cobalt (50 mg/l hardness) to greater-than-or-equal=to 3833-mu-g/l (800 mg/l hardness). Effects were on fish survival and not growth. Regression analysis yielded an R2 = 0.97 based on the fish survival NOECs and the natural log of hardness. C dubia chronic tests were inconclusive due to poor survival and reproduction in the synthetic waters. Available data suggest that within 50-200 mg/l water hardness, cobalt acute toxicity is inversely related to water hardness. Tentative cobalt acute criteria, based on power functions, are 288-mu-g/l and 873-mu-g/l for soft and hard water, respectively. Available chronic toxicity data suggest that daphnids are more sensitive to cobalt than other genera. Chronic endpoints for both P. promelas and D. magna were similar in soft and hard water (less-than-or-equal-to 400 mg/l hardness) suggesting that chronic toxicity is not hardness-dependent over this range. However, chronic endpoints at 800 mg/l hardness were 3.1 and greater-than-or-equal-to 12 times higher than endpoints observed under soft water conditions for P. promelas and C dubia respectively suggesting that very hard waters may significantly reduce chronic toxicity potential of cobalt.

AB  - Clouds - their coverage, nature, and interactions with the energy budget of the planet - represent one of the primary sources of uncertainty in future climate prediction. Despite the crucial role of desert clouds in the distribution of water and energy budgets, their climatology is still largely incomplete. With arid regions projected to become dryer under global warming conditions, understanding the characteristics of their cloud cover can provide critical insights. In this work, cloud coverage was investigated over one of the Earth's most arid regions - the Arabian Peninsula. Four total cloud cover (FCC) products, namely the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project H (ISCCP), the CM SAF Cloud, Albedo and Surface Radiation AVHRR 2 (CLARA) satellite datasets, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) Reanalysis (R-2) (NCEP) and the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA) reanalyses, were used to construct a climatology of desert clouds over the peninsula between 1984 and 2009, accounting for the different products' uncertainties and limitations. Satellite retrievals and reanalysis fields were first validated against ground observations from the United Arab Emirates, for which homogeneity assessments were conducted. The validation was done using statistical indicators, including Normalized Root Mean Square Errors (nRMSE), relative biases (rBIAS), and correlation coefficients, on monthly and seasonal scales. The ISCCP dataset resulted in the highest correlations with the ground observations (overall 0.38) and the lowest nRMSE (overall 0.54), while CLARA had the lowest rBIAS (overall 0.02). All products showed discrepancies when compared to the ground observations, both annually and on a seasonal basis. When extended to the entire Arabian Peninsula, the satellite and reanalysis products showed decreasing spring and increasing summer (except for ISCCP) TCC evolution across the region. At inter-annual scales, the TCC over the peninsula showed a significant discontinuity in 1998. This shift could be linked to the forcing of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on water vapor transport over the region, as well as to documented artifacts in satellite retrievals and model outputs. These discrepancies are indicative of a need for detailed assessments to be made of the uncertainties existing in TCC data for the Arabian Peninsula.
   Plain Language Summary: Clouds represent a primary source of uncertainty in future climate predictions. This is particularly pronounced in dryland clouds, given their sporadic and intermittent nature. With global warming predicted to enhance aridification trends in terrestrial arid zones, historical cloudiness trends over arid and hyper arid regions are very important - yet their climatology to date is still largely incomplete. The quality of observations and/or model outputs are an important consideration, making validation and intercomparison assessments imperative.
   This work investigated cloud cover over the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most arid regions on the Earth. Four cloud cover datasets were used, derived from satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis model outputs. The selected study period was between 1984 and 2009. The four datasets were initially compared with observations taken at ground stations in the United Arab Emirates. The four products were then studied over the entire Arabian Peninsula. Results showed that cloud cover displayed marked seasonal characteristics and large inter-annual temporal evolution. An abrupt change in regional cloud cover time series was found to occur in 1998. This could be attributed to the forcing of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, although significant documented uncertainties in satellite products over this time span call for deeper investigations of this causal relation.

AB  - Unique sizes and a high level of bioavailability allow nanoparticles of metals (NPMe) to come into direct contact with biological systems, with infectious agents, toxins, as well as with different chemical compounds and separate cell structures (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids). Other biological effects, including less toxicity than in microscopic substances, require attention to be paid to the study of the potential risk of using nanoparticles of each type in a particular way, therefore scientific support is absolutely necessary in this direction. It is believed that the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials is due to genomic and mutagenic effects, but the mechanical forces of interaction of NPM. with cells, obviously, will change not only cytological but also their metabolic reactions. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the biochemical markers of safety (potential toxicity) of NPMe (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Co, GFCo, Zn, MnO2) on the model of isolated membrane and cytosolic fractions of eukaryotic test cells of CHO-K1 and U937 lines. Under conditions of preincubation of experimental samples of NPMe at a final concentration of 1 mu g/cm(3) by the metal with preparations of subcellular fractions of CHO-K1 and U937 (in the final amount of protein 150-200 mu g/cm(3)) for 3 minutes at 37 +/- 1 degrees C, there was determined the magnitude of membrane ATP-ase and cytosolic LDH-ase activity compared to intact cells ("control"). According to the results of the research, colloidal dispersions of NPAg average size similar to 30 nm, NPFe similar to 100 nm, NPCu similar to 70 nm, and NPMnO2 similar to 50 nm are safe and biocompatible by their membranotropic effect on subcellular fractions of eukaryotic test cells, as evidenced by an increase in the level of membrane ATPase and cytosolic LDHase of test-cells CHO-K1, and the experimental samples NPCo, NPGFCo and NPZn average size of similar to 100 nm are membrane-toxic, that is, dangerous. By the nature of the changes in the enzymatic activity of the test cells U937, the discrete dimensions of the membranotropic action of NPAu have been demonstrated: nanoparticles of size similar to 10 nm caused the inhibition of the membrane Na+,K+-ATPase, and the size of similar to 30 nm and similar to 45 nm -its induction; nanoparticles of size similar to 10, similar to 20 and similar to 30 nm induced cytosolic LDHase and the size of similar to 45 nm -its inhibition relative to the control level of enzymes, so NPAu similar to 10 and similar to 45 nm can be considered membrane toxic, and size similar to 30 nm - safe and biocompatible for eukaryotic cells. Based on the hypothesis about the involvement of metabolism-dependent mechanisms of contact interaction of colloidal dispersions of experimental samples of NPMe with cells through membranotropic properties, the study of their potential danger or biocompatibility in further research can be carried out by determining the intensity of oxidation of the main structural components of biomembranes of cells - lipids and proteins and indicators of their AO-regulation.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is becoming an increasingly widespread tool in support systems for environmental decision-making regarding the cleanup of contaminated sites. In this study, the use of LCA to compare the environmental impacts of different remediation technologies was reviewed. Remediation of a contaminated site reduces a local environmental problem, but at the same time, the remediation activities may cause negative environmental impacts on the local, regional, and global scale. LCA can be used to evaluate the inherent trade-off and to compare remediation scenarios in terms of their associated environmental burden.
   An overview of the assessed remediation technologies and contaminant types covered in the literature is presented. The LCA methodologies of the 12 reviewed studies were compared and discussed with special focus on their goal and scope definition and the applied impact assessment. The studies differ in their basic approach since some are prospective with focus on decision-support while others are retrospective aiming at a more detailed assessment of a completed remediation project.
   The literature review showed that only few life cycle assessments have been conducted for in situ remediation technologies aimed at groundwater-threatening contaminants and that the majority of the existing literature focuses on ex situ remediation of contaminated soil. The functional unit applied in the studies is generally based on the volume of contaminated soil (or groundwater) to be treated; this is in four of the studies combined with a cleanup target for the remediation. While earlier studies often used more simplified impact assessment models, the more recent studies based their impact assessment on established methodologies covering the conventional set of impact categories. Ecotoxicity and human toxicity are the impact categories varying the most between these methodologies. Many of the reviewed studies address the importance of evaluating both primary and secondary impacts of site remediation. Primary impacts cover the local impacts related to residual contamination left in the subsurface during and after remediation and will vary between different remediation technologies due to different cleanup efficiencies and cleanup times. Secondary impacts are resource use and emissions arising in other stages of the life cycle of the remediation project.
   Among the reviewed literature, different approaches for modeling the long-term primary impacts of site contamination have been used. These include steady state models as well as dynamic models. Primary impacts are not solely a soil contamination or surface water issue, since many frequently occurring contaminants, such as chlorinated solvents, have the potential to migrate to the groundwater as well as evaporate to ambient air causing indoor climate problems. Impacts in the groundwater compartment are not included in established impact assessment methodologies; thus, the potential groundwater contamination impacts from residual contamination are difficult to address in LCA of site remediation. Due to the strong dependence on local conditions (sensitivity of groundwater aquifer, use for drinking water supply, etc.) a more site-specific impact assessment approach than what is normally applied in LCA is of relevance.
   The inclusion of groundwater impacts from soil contaminants requires the definition of an impact category covering human toxicity via groundwater or the inclusion of these impacts in the human toxicity impact category and the associated characterization models and normalization procedures. When evaluating groundwater impacts, attention should also be paid to potentially degradable contaminants forming metabolites of higher human toxic concern than the parent compound.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) demands for an integrated biological assessment of surface water bodies. The assessment should use "biological Quality Elements" as indicators and be based on comparing the observed biota with stream type specific reference condition biota to reflect the impact of various stressors. Moreover, the WFD demands that restoration measures must be taken whenever the Ecological Quality Class (EQC) is "Moderate" or worse. Therefore, it is important to know the reliability of assessment results in order to judge whether an expensive restoration measure is justified or not.
   The degree of uncertainty is linked with the variability of the data. The aim of the present study was to investigate the variability of benthic invertebrate samples of running waters. In 26 mid-sized streams in Germany, two samples were taken following a slightly modified STAR/AQEM protocol (N(Total) = 52). The STAR/AQEM protocol (Furse et al. 2006. STAE consortium 2003) is the result of two successive EU-funded projects, which aimed to develop a standardised macroinvertebrate sampling protocol and assessment system for running waters (Furse et al. 2006. Hering et al. 2003). STAR/AQEM multi-habitat sampling is based on 20 sampling units, which are distributed proportional to the estimated microhabitat covers at a sampling site. The two samples of each stream were taken at sites which were relatively close to one another (100 to 650m) and had similar structural parameters, hydromorphology and physical/chemical parameters. Thus, it was expected that biocoenoses at both sites and assessment results should be similar.
   However, the results showed that samples differed in terms of number of taxa and abundances. These differences caused deviations in metric results, including the Multimetric Index (MMI) and its constituent core metrics, such as the percentage of EPT-Taxa (EPT [%]) or number of EPTCBO-Taxa (EPTCBO). In 10 of 26 causes the differences in metric assessment results led to different ecological quality classes (EQCS).
   In order to quantify uncertainty in assessment results, the STARBUGS simulation software was used. By simulating metric scores based on the observed sampling variance in the present data set, this software calculates the confidence probability of a sample belonging to each of the five possible EQCs. For the MMI the average confidence probability that a stream site truly belonged to EQC estimated from the observed sample was 89%. This means that the probability that a stream site belongs to a different EQC than the assessment result indicates was quite low (approximately 11%). However, it is discussed that the given confidence probabilities can only be used to estimate the precision of the analysed samples - the results cannot be used for estimating the probability of future samples delivering the same assessment result.
   Moreover, the present study revealed that certain metrics are more susceptible to variability (EPT [%]m EPTCBO) than others (e.g. German Fauna Index "GFI"). The reasons for variability and consequently uncertainty inherent to benthic invertebrate samples are discussed. The results of the present study stress the importance of implementing standardised sampling and sorting protocols and quality control mechanisms in benthic invertebrate assessment schemes.

AB  - The joint effect of multiple initial decisions made about sampling design in evaluation of environmental impacts using observational field assessments influences the ability to detect and accurately estimate responses. The design can dictate in advance whether the study can identify even large impacts that truly exist. Following the 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill in 1989, 4 separate studies of effects of the spill on the intertidal biota were conducted. Studies overlapped sufficiently in geographic area, shoreline habitat, and biological response variables to permit contrasts showing how the aggregate of multiple design decisions led to differences in conclusions. The SEP (ShoreLine Ecology Program) supported by Exxon and the CHIA (Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment) funded by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council shared a core approach of establishing a stratified random design of site selection. The Exxon-supported GOA (Gulf of Alaska) study and the NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) Hazmat (Hazardous Materials) study both chose to employ subjective choices of fixed sites. Despite many common goals, these 4 studies differed greatly in: (1) sampling effort (area covered per sample quadrat, sample replication within sites, numbers of study sites per category, numbers of samplings, and total areas sampled) and sampling design (philosophy of targeting sampling effort, complete randomization versus matched pair designs, sampling frame, treatment of habitat heterogeneity within sites, interspersion of sites, and control of shoreline treatment and oiling intensity); (2) analytical methodology (analysis of covariance versus paired designs, treatment of subsamples as replicates in F-ratios, logic of inferring recovery, and power calculations); and (3) choice of biological response variables (taxonomic level of analysis. aggregating versus spitting separate communities, and scope of communities and habitats examined). The CHIA and NOAA Hazmat studies of epibiotic responses in sheltered rocky shores of Prince William Sound made several decisions to enhance detection power and produced similar conclusions about large reductions in total biotic cover of intertidal space, Fucus cover, mussel abundance, abundance of the Limpet Tectura persona and a balanoid barnacle, and increases in open space and abundance of an opportunistic barnacle, Chthamalus dalli. In contrast, the SEP study of this same habitat and geographic region adopted design choices resulting in lower power of detection in 12 (vs CHIA and vs NOAA Hazmat) of 15 separate decisions (with one tie in each contrast). Accordingly, the SEP study was able to detect declines only in Fucus cover and occasionally in total Limpet abundance but not in total epifaunal or mussel or balanoid barnacle abundance and, unlike the results of the other 2 studies, most of the taxa analyzed showed apparent increases rather than decreases from oiling and shoreline treatment. The more powerful GOA and CHIA studies of impacts of oiling in the Gulf of Alaska, where oil grounded 1 to 8 wk later and in more weathered condition than in Prince William Sound, showed more consistent and larger reductions in intertidal biota in the sheltered rocky habitat than did the SEP study of Prince William Sound. Thus, the combined effects of many design decisions that reduced power to detect impacts in the SEP study led to failure to demonstrate large impacts of the spill documented by other studies of the same habitat in the same and the more remote region.

AB  - Purpose Youth entrepreneurship has been identified as a key driver in overcoming the economic crisis spurred by youth unemployment. However, the understanding of youth entrepreneurship is largely based on research in high-income countries. Furthermore, entrepreneurship studies to date are largely limited to the independent effects of individual traits on entrepreneurial intention (EI). Hence, this study aims to model the cognitive and social conditions, mediating processes and interactions to understand how youth EI can be formed and strengthened in an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional sample of 295 Malaysian youths participating in an online entrepreneurship program were included to assess their family socioeconomic background, individual personality traits and EI using regression, mediation and moderation models. Within the sample, 29 youths who completed the program were examined for pre- and post-training intervention differences to identify whether entrepreneurial traits can be developed. Findings Results showed that a proactive personality or proactiveness was a key mediator in how an internal locus of control (ILOC) and self-esteem influence EI. Furthermore, ILOC and proactiveness were found to compensate for the lack of parental financial support in the formation of EI among low-income youth. Finally, there was a significant increase in proactive personality scores post-intervention, indicating that this trait can be strengthened through entrepreneurship programs. Research limitations/implications This study focused on parental income as an indicator of family socioeconomic background, which may not accurately represent the diversity of the socio-ecological environment of an individual. Therefore, future research should assess the multi-dimensional indicators of socioeconomic status and their relations with psychological attributes in shaping EI. Furthermore, this study observed a small sample size for the pre- and post-intervention analysis. Hence, more studies with large sample sizes are needed to examine the impact of entrepreneurship education. Practical implications Considering that entrepreneurship is envisioned as an instrument to lift youths out of poverty, this study has important implications for entrepreneurship programs that target low-income youths. The findings suggest that such programs need to first emphasize developing ILOC and proactiveness among these youths, thus enabling them to overcome various structural barriers toward entrepreneurship, as opposed to a purely knowledge-based learning approach. Social implications To effectively lift youths out of poverty through entrepreneurship, policymakers and educational institutions need to first recognize that the EI of youth from varying socioeconomic backgrounds are formed differently. Hence, the approach of entrepreneurship programs catered toward youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will differ from programs catered to youths who are financially secure. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, entrepreneurship programs targeted at low-income youths must first emphasize building their mindsets of ILOC and proactivity to overcome financial challenges as opposed to focusing solely on building entrepreneurial skills and knowledge. Originality/value The findings offer a more holistic and nuanced view of the contingencies where the efforts of policymakers, educational institutions and practitioners are more likely to succeed in stimulating EI among youths in emerging economies.
   In addition, the study also bridges the gap between the theoretical understanding of EI and the practical implications of developing effective entrepreneurship programs by combining the cross-sectional analysis and pre- and post-intervention test in the same study. Importantly, the study highlighted the importance of considering youth's socioeconomic background in the design and implementation of entrepreneurship programs.

AB  - Non-point source pollution is a cause of major concern within the European Union. This is reflected in increasing public and political focus on a more sustainable use of pesticides, as well as a reduction in diffuse pollution. Climate change will likely to lead to an even more intensive use of pesticides in the future, affecting agriculture in many ways. At the same time, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and associated EU policies called for a "good" ecological and chemical status to be achieved for water bodies by the end of 2015, currently delayed to 2021-2027 due to a lack of efficiency in policies and timescale of resilience for hydrosystems, especially groundwater systems. Water managers need appropriate and user-friendly tools to design agro-environmental policies. These tools should help them to evaluate the potential impacts of mitigation measures on water resources, more clearly define protected areas, and more efficiently distribute financial incentives to farmers who agree to implement alternative practices. At present, a number of reports point out that water managers do not use appropriate information from monitoring or models to make decisions and set environmental action plans. In this paper, we propose an integrated and collaborative approach to analyzing changes in land use, farming systems, and practices and to assess their effects on agricultural pressure and pesticide transfers to waters. The integrated modeling of agricultural scenario (IMAS) framework draws on a range of data and expert knowledge available within areas where a pesticide action plan can be defined to restore the water quality, French "Grenelle law" catchment areas, French Water Development and Management Plan areas, etc. A so-called "reference scenario" represents the actual soil occupation and pesticide-spraying practices used in both conventional and organic farming. A number of alternative scenarios are then defined in cooperation with stakeholders, including socio-economic conditions for developing alternative agricultural systems or targeting mitigation measures. Our integrated assessment of these scenarios combines the calculation of spatialized environmental indicators with integrated bio-economic modeling. The latter is achieved by a combined use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling with our own purpose-built land use generator module (Generator of Land Use version 2 (GenLU2)) and an economic model developed using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) for cost-effectiveness assessment. This integrated approach is applied to two embedded catchment areas (total area of 360,000 ha) within the Charente river basin (SW France). Our results show that it is possible to differentiate scenarios based on their effectiveness, represented by either evolution of pressure (agro-environmental indicators) or transport into waters (pesticide concentrations). By analyzing the implementation costs borne by farmers, it is possible to identify the most cost-effective scenarios at sub-basin and other aggregated levels (WFD hydrological entities, sensitive areas). Relevant results and indicators are fed into a specifically designed database. Data warehousing is used to provide analyses and outputs at all thematic, temporal, or spatial aggregated levels, defined by the stakeholders (type of crops, herbicides, WFD areas, years), using Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) tools.
   The aim of this approach is to allow public policy makers to make more informed and reasoned decisions when managing sensitive areas and/or implementing mitigation measures.

AB  - Aim To identify and quantify biotic and abiotic factors associated with the regional gradients in the distribution and abundance of bird communities restricted and endemic to the Succulent and Nama Karoo biomes of South Africa.
   Location The arid Nama and Succulent Karoo biomes in South Africa.
   Methods The quarter degree grid cell (QDGC) was used to extract environmental data, while the bird data previously atlased, was linked to the same geo-referenced system, using a geographical information system (GIS). Bird species were grouped into different life-history assemblages. A quantitative, systematic analysis of the different bird communities spanning the Karoo was undertaken to examine contributions of broad- and local-scale physical environmental and biotic factors to regional variations in the species composition, using multivariate statistical and spatial analytical tools. These included two indirect gradient methods; principal components analysis (PCA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and two direct gradient methods; canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA).
   Results Principal components analysis results showed that the selected environmental variables accounted for about 85% of the variation in the region. The first two principal gradients defined regional temperature seasonality and variability especially in winter and summer. The third principal gradient mainly defined summer rainfall areas in association with the coefficient of variation of rain and regional primary production, while the fourth gradient defined winter rainfall areas, growth days and elements of landscape structure. CCA/RDA analysis produced shortened hierarchically ranked explanatory variables for each bird assemblage. Stepwise gradient analysis results showed summer rain, rainfall concentration, topographic heterogeneity and annual evapotranspiration, as the most important climate variables explaining species occurrence. Landscape, in terms of percentage transformation, morphology, coefficient of variation of primary productivity and distance between suitable habitat patches, were also important, but to a lesser degree. Total variation explained (TVE) by the supplied variables was between 23 and 37% of variation. Less than 20% of TVE was the intrinsic spatial component of environmental influence, indicating that any unmeasured factors were independent of spatial structuring. For all the eight bird assemblages, climate contributed most to TVE (24-57%). Landscape characteristics (human-induced transformation, vegetation in terms of size if grassy clumps and the average distances between them) contributed theleast to TVE for all the different assemblages (0-6%), especially the granivorous assemblage where it was not significant at all (0%). Seasonal extremes and variability were more important in explaining species gradients than were annual climatic conditions, with the exception of annual potential evapotranspiration.
   Main conclusions This study was able to synthesize species environment relations at the broad scale and demonstrated the association of arid zone endemic species occurrence with climate extremes and seasonality. Given the predicted climate change scenarios for South Africa, this regional gradient study provides a quantitative ecological basis for finer scale modelling and analysis, developing regional strategies for conserving biodiversity as well as predicting and planning for the effects of global climate change. However, most importantly, it clearly showed that bird species restricted and endemic to the arid Karoo biome may be more sensitive to climate rather than vegetation structure as previously thought.

AB  - The grain-producing regions of northern New South Wales and southern and central Queensland are characterised by cropping systems that are strongly dependent on stored soil moisture rather than in-crop rainfall, and tillage systems that are increasingly reliant on zero or minimum tillage. Crops are grown relatively infrequently and crop rotations are dominated by winter and summer grains (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor L. Moench], respectively), with smaller areas of grain legumes and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). The grey, black, and brown Vertosols represent the more productive soils in the region under rainfed cropping, and are the focus of work reported in this study.
   Soil samples were collected from surface soils (0-0.30 m) across the region, utilising sites of long term tillage and residue management studies, fertiliser trials, and commercial fields to enable an assessment of the impact of various management practices on soil biological properties. A number of biological and biochemical parameters were measured (microbial biomass C, total organic C and labile C fractions, total C and N, microbial activity using FDA, cellulase activity, free living nematodes, total DNA and fatty acid profiles), and the response of wheat, sorghum, and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) to steam pasteurisation was assessed in glasshouse bioassays. The objective was to obtain an indication of the biological status of grain-growing soils and assess the impact of biological constraints in soils from different regions and management systems.
   Results showed that biological activity in cropped soils was consistently low relative to other land uses in northern Australia, with management practices like stubble retention and adoption of zero tillage producing relatively small benefits. In the case of zero tillage, many of these benefits were confined to the top 0.05 m of the soil profile. Fallowing to recharge soil moisture reserves significantly reduced all soil biological parameters, while pasture leys produced consistent positive benefits. Breaking a long fallow with a short duration grain or brown manure crop significantly moderated the negative effects of a long bare fallow on soil biology. Use of inorganic N and P fertilisers produced minimal effects on soil biota, with the exception of one component of the free-living nematode community (the Dorylaimida).
   The glasshouse bioassays provided consistent evidence that soil biota were constraining growth of both grain crops (sorghum and wheat) but not the grain legume (chickpea). The biota associated with this constraint have not yet been identified, but effects were consistent across the region and were not associated with the presence of any known pathogen or correlated with any of the measured soil biological or biochemical properties. Further work to confirm the existence and significance of these constraints under field conditions is needed.
   None of the measured biological or biochemical parameters consistently changed in response to management practices, while conflicting conclusions could sometimes be drawn from different measurements on the same soil sample. This highlights the need for further work on diagnostic tools to quantify soil biological communities, and suggests there is no clear link between measured changes in soil biological communities and economically or ecologically important soil attributes.

AB  - A novel concept - the hygiene-based margin of safety (HBMOS) - is suggested for the assessment of the impact of potential endocrine modulators. It integrates exposure scenarios and potency data for industrial chemicals and naturally occurring dietary compounds with oestrogenic activity. An HBMOS is defined as a quotient of estimated daily intakes weighted by the relative in vivo potencies of these compounds. The Existing Chemicals Programme of the European Union provides Human and Environmental Risk Assessments of Existing Chemicals which include human exposure scenarios. Such exposure scenarios, along with potency estimates for endocrine activities, may provide a basis for a quantitative comparison of the potential endocrine-modulating effects of industrial chemicals with endocrine modulators as natural constituents of human diet. Natural phyto-oestrogens exhibit oestrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo. Important phyto-oestrogens for humans are isoflavones (daidzein, genistein) and lignans, with the highest quantities found in soybeans and flaxseed, respectively. Daily isoflavone exposures calculated for infants on soy-based formulae were in the ranges of 4.5-8 mg/kg body wt.; estimates for adults range up to 1 mg/kg body wt. The Senate Commission on the Evaluation of Food Safety (SKLM) of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft has also indicated a wide range of dietary exposures. For matters of risk assessment, the SKLM has based recommendations on dietary exposure scenarios, implying a daily intake of phyto-oestrogens in the order of 1 mg/kg body wt. On the basis of information compiled within the Existing Chemicals Programme of the EU, it appears that a daily human exposure to nonylphenol of 2 mug/kg body wt. may be a worst-case assumption, but which is based on valid scenarios. The intake of octylphenol is much lower, due to a different use pattern and applications, and may be neglected. Data from migration studies led to estimations of the daily human uptake of bisphenol A of maximally 1 mug/kg body wt. On the basis of comparative data from uterotrophic assays in rats, with three consecutive days of oral applications involved, and taking the natural phyto-oestrogen daidzein as reference (=1), relative uterotrophic activities in DA/Han rats follow the sequence: daidzein = 1; bisphenol A = 1; p-tert-octylphenol = 2; o, p'-DDT = 4; ethinyl oestradiol = 40,000. The derived values from exposure scenarios, as well as these relative potency values and bridging assumptions, led to calculations of HBMOS as a quantitative comparison of potential endocrine-modulating effects of industrial chemicals with those of natural constituents of human diet. HBMOS estimates for nonylphenol ranged between 250 and 500, dependent on bridging assumptions, and around 1000 for bisphenol A. The derivations of HBMOS were in full support of the conclusions reached by the SKLM of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The estimated HBMOS values for the industrial chemicals (nonylphenol, bisphenol A) appear sufficiently high to ensure the absence of a practical risk to human health under the present exposure conditions.

AB  - The article studies the transformation and regulation of the phenomenon of unevenness of socio-economic space. We provide detailed comments on a fundamental nature of the unevenness of development of socio-economic space in any territorial entity (region, country, district, etc.) and point out the importance of research on the unevenness of development from the standpoint of science and management. We substantiate a priority approach to the study of unevenness; in the framework of this approach we move consistently from quantitative assessment of the phenomenon of unevenness of space through identification of specifics and patterns to forecasting and practical recommendations for management. All this is related to the prospects of further research. We present the importance and relevance of this study, which aims to identify specifics of the phenomenon of unevenness of socio-economic development of cities and districts of the Murmansk Oblast, and to forecast its dynamics and regulation in present-day crisis conditions. The paper presents a comprehensive vision for methodological support of research on the differentiation of socio-economic space; it also substantiates the authors' own version of methodological tools to assess the phenomenon of differentiation of socio-economic development in cities and districts of the region. Having tested the proposed techniques that help assess differentiation, we consider comparative dynamics of cities and districts of the Murmansk Oblast: we rank the objects by level of socio-economic development and identify trends and patterns in the development of the phenomenon. We make a forecast of how the crisis can impact the development of differentiation between cities and districts of the Murmansk Oblast according to two scenarios: the basic scenario assumes that most social indicators will either remain stable or experience slight differentiation, and a further slight increase is expected in the differentiation of economic indicators. The target scenario assumes a similar situation on social indicators and a higher growth rate of differentiation of economic indicators. Having identified trends in the development of differentiation of socio-economic space in the Murmansk Oblast and having forecast the impact of the crisis on the ratio of differentiation parameters we substantiate a comprehensive vision of immediate actions and management perspectives: it is necessary to pursue the regional policy defined by specific objectives of strategic planning in the Murmansk Oblast; to prevent further reduction in the number of medical organizations in the region, to maintain and increase the number of medical personnel in municipalities; to enhance regional measures in the investment sector; to stimulate economic growth in the Kola bearing zone, including the establishment of new legal and regulatory environment. Scientific novelty of the findings consists in the fact that they contribute to the development of theoretical and methodological ideas about the formation of the phenomenon of differentiation of cities and districts in the Arctic region. Our research is different from other works on this topic due to its comprehensiveness and a certain originality in using assessment techniques, which made it possible for the first time to identify specifics and development trends of this phenomenon in the Murmansk Oblast that are relevant for management theory and practice. In view of the above, the findings can be widely used in fundamental and applied science and in territorial management.

AB  - Introduction. There has been some recent concern regarding possible systemic health effects resulting from elevated blood cobalt concentrations in patients with cobalt containing hip implants. To date there are no blood cobalt criteria to help guide physicians when evaluating an individual hip implant patient's risk of developing systemic health effects because historically there was little or no concern about systemic cobalt toxicity in implant patients. Objective. Our purpose is to describe recently completed research regarding the relationship between blood cobalt concentrations and clinical health effects. We discuss the possibility of systemic health effects in patients with metal containing implants and propose various blood cobalt concentrations that are not associated with an increased risk of developing certain adverse effects. Methodology. The primary literature search was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science using the following search terms: cobalt AND (toxicity OR health effects OR cardiotoxicity OR hematological OR endocrine OR immunological OR reproductive OR testicular effects OR neurological OR case report OR cohort OR Roncovite). The searches identified 6786 papers of which 122 were considered relevant. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry toxicological profile for cobalt and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development's National Center for Environmental Assessment's documentation on the provisional peer-reviewed toxicity value for cobalt were also utilized to identify secondary literature sources. Results. Our review of the toxicology and medical literature indicates that highly elevated blood cobalt concentrations can result in certain endocrine, hematological, cardiovascular, and neurological effects in animals and/or humans. These studies, in addition to historical clinical findings involving the therapeutic use of cobalt, indicate that significant systemic effects of cobalt will not occur below blood cobalt concentrations of 300 mu g/L in most persons. Some individuals with specific risk factors for increased susceptibility (e. g., severe and sustained hypoalbuminemia) may exhibit systemic effects at lower cobalt blood concentrations. This review also describes several cobalt dosing studies performed with human volunteers that consumed cobalt for 15, 30, or 90 days. Overall, the results of these dosing studies indicate that sustained blood cobalt concentrations averaging 10-70 mu g/L for up to 90 days cause no significant clinical effects (maximum concentrations approached 120 mu g/L). Some proposed blood criteria for assessing implant wear and local tissue damage have been suggested by several medical groups. For example, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has proposed a blood cobalt guidance value of 7 mu g/L, and the Mayo Clinic has suggested serum cobalt concentrations greater than 10 mu g/L, but both of these values are primarily intended to address implant wear and to alert physicians to the possibility of an increased incidence of local effects. There is a clear lack of consensus regarding how to identify a specific numerical blood concentration of concern and whether whole blood or serum is a better matrix to assess total cobalt concentration. Conclusions. Based on currently available data, only under very unusual circumstances should a clinician expect that biologically important systemic adverse effects might occur in implant patients with blood cobalt concentrations less than 300 mu g/L.
   Patients with metal-containing hip implants who exhibit signs or symptoms potentially related to polycythemia, hypothyroidism, neurological, or cardiac dysfunction should be clinically evaluated for these conditions. Polycythemia appears to be the most sensitive endpoint.

AB  - This research was conducted in a 95-year-old, highly productive stand of black alder growing in the Drava plain in Croatia. The goal was to investigate the main features of carbon-nitrogen accumulation and dynamics in the stand of black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), as an indicator of ecosystem stability and sustainability of managing such stands.
   Soil physiography was investigated in a permanent sample plot sized 1 ha with growing stock of 751 m(3) ha(-1). In the course of one season of leaf litter decomposition, the forest floor and soil from the A horizon were sampled on three occasions; the first sampling took place after leaf drop in 2009, the second at the beginning of vegetation (April 2010), and the third before leaf drop (beginning of November 2010). The forest floor mass was determined and so was the carbon and nitrogen content in the forest floor, in the bark, in the physiologically mature leaf and in the soil, as well as the soil pH value. Dendrochronological analysis was performed on black alder wood specimens to determine wood density and carbon and nitrogen content.
   Data from piezometers set up within the plot for the period 1997-2000 were used to interpret the water regime.
   According to the research, the soil is Haplic Gleysol (Endoarenic), with a relatively shallow A horizon, of sandy-clayey to loamy-sandy texture, of weakly acidic and in the deeper part weakly alkaline reaction. The water regime is characterized by a shallow and stable groundwater level which occasionally causes shallow (up to 2030 cm) flooding in the out-of-vegetation period, and does not drop below 130 cm in the vegetation period. The forest floor mass ranges from 4.71 Mg ha(-1) after leaf drop, over 3.36 Mg ha(-1) in the spring, to 0.51 Mg ha(-1) in the autumn before renewed leaf drop, which indicates complete decomposition of black alder leaf litter in a yearly cycle. During this period the C:N ratio decreases from 19 to 14.8. Carbon and nitrogen content in the A horizon increases from autumn to spring, but drops again afterwards. Simultaneously, the pH value significantly drops from autumn to spring, but rises again by autumn. In mid-summer, carbon accumulation in the above-ground biomass of the stand is 214.6 Mg ha(-1) while in the soil it is 143.5 Mg ha(-1) on average. On the other hand, nitrogen accumulation is higher in the soil: while it is 2 Mg ha(-1) in the above-ground biomass, it reaches over 14 Mg ha(-1) (13.8 on average) in the soil. Overall accumulation of organic carbon in the ecosystem is 359.5 Mg ha(-1), and of nitrogen it is 15.8 Mg ha(-1).
   The research has confirmed that this is an exceptionally vital stand, evidently with excellent ecological conditions for the growth of black alder. The vitality and long-term stability of this stand is best reflected in the stable ring width index in the past 80 years, as confirmed by the very large growing stock amounting to 751 m(3) ha(-1) for a stand aged 93-98 (above the taxation limit of 7 cm).

AB  - African farming systems are highly heterogeneous: between agroecological and socioeconomic environments, in the wide variability in farmers' resource endowments and in farm management. This means that single solutions (or 'silver bullets') for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems - Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. NUANCES offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term 'best-fit' technologies technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The NUANCES framework is not 'just another computer model We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through 'maintenance fertilization' from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies - both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next.

AB  - In October-November 2011 we measured trace gas emission factors from seven prescribed fires in South Carolina (SC), US, using two Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) systems and whole air sampling (WAS) into canisters followed by gas-chromatographic analysis. A total of 97 trace gas species were quantified from both airborne and ground-based sampling platforms, making this one of the most detailed field studies of fire emissions to date. The measurements include the first emission factors for a suite of monoterpenes produced by heating vegetative fuels during field fires. The first quantitative FTIR observations of limonene in smoke are reported along with an expanded suite of monoterpenes measured by WAS including alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, camphene, 4-carene, and myrcene. The known chemistry of the monoterpenes and their measured abundance of 0.4-27.9% of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) and similar to 21% of organic aerosol (mass basis) suggests that they impacted secondary formation of ozone (O-3), aerosols, and small organic trace gases such as methanol and formaldehyde in the sampled plumes in the first few hours after emission. The variability in the initial terpene emissions in the SC fire plumes was high and, in general, the speciation of the initially emitted gas-phase NMOCs was 13-195% different from that observed in a similar study in nominally similar pine forests in North Carolina similar to 20 months earlier. It is likely that differences in stand structure and environmental conditions contributed to the high variability observed within and between these studies. Similar factors may explain much of the variability in initial emissions in the literature. The Delta HCN/Delta CO emission ratio, however, was found to be fairly consistent with previous airborne fire measurements in other coniferous-dominated ecosystems, with the mean for these studies being 0.90+/-0.06 %, further confirming the value of HCN as a biomass burning tracer. The SC results also support an earlier finding that C3C4 alkynes may be of use as biomass burning indicators on the time-scale of hours to a day. It was possible to measure the downwind chemical evolution of the plume on four of the fires and significant O-3 formation (Delta O-3/Delta CO from 1090 %) occurred in all of these plumes within two hours. The slowest O-3 production was observed on a cloudy day with low co-emission of NOx. The fastest O-3 production was observed on a sunny day when the downwind plume almost certainly incorporated significant additional NOx by passing over the Columbia, SC metropolitan area. Due to rapid plume dilution, it was only possible to acquire high-quality downwind data for two other trace gas species (formaldehyde and methanol) during two of the fires. In all four of these cases, significant increases in formaldehyde and methanol were observed in < 2 h. This is likely the first direct observation of post-emission methanol production in biomass burning plumes. Post-emission production of methanol does not always happen in young biomass burning plumes, and its occurrence in this study could have involved terpene precursors to a significant extent.

AB  - One of the core ideas behind organic production is that cropping systems should be less dependent on import of resources, and minimize negative effects on the surrounding environment compared to conventional production. However, even when clearly complying with regulations for organic production, it is not always obvious that these goals are reached. As an example, strong dependence on import of manure is often seen in current organic production, especially in systems producing high value crops such as vegetable crops.
   The aim of the present study was to test novel approaches to organic rotations, designed to reduce the reliance on import of external resources significantly. We compared a conventional system (C) and an organic system relying on manure import for soil fertility (O1) to two novel systems (O2 and O3) all based on the same crop rotation. The O2 and O3 systems represented new versions of the organic rotation, both relying on green manures and catch crops grown during the autumn after the main crop as their main source of soil fertility, and the O3 system further leaving rows of the green manures to grow as intercrops between vegetable rows to improve the conditions for biodiversity and natural pest regulation in the crops. Reliance on resource import to the systems differed, with average annual import of nitrogen fertilizers of 149, 85, 25 and 25 kg N ha(-1) in the C, O1, O2 and O3 systems, respectively.
   As expected, the crop yields were lower in the organic system. It differed strongly among crop species, but on average the organic crops yielded c. 82% of conventional yields in all three organic systems, when calculated based on the area actually grown with the main crops. In the O3 system some of the area of the vegetable fields was allocated to intercrops, so vegetable yields calculated based on total land area was only 63% of conventional yields.
   Differences in quality parameters of the harvested crops, i.e. nutrient content, dry matter content or damages by pests or diseases were few and not systematic, whereas clear effects on nutrient balances and nitrogen leaching indicators were found. Root growth of all crops was studied in the C and O2 system, but only few effects of cropping system on root growth was observed. However, the addition of green manures to the systems almost doubled the average soil exploration by active root systems during the rotation from only 21% in C to 38% in O2 when measured to 2.4m depth. This relates well to the observed differences in subsoil inorganic N content (N-inorg. 1-2 m depth) across the whole rotation (74 and 61 kg N ha(-1) in C and O1 vs. only 22 and 21 kg N ha(-1) in O2 and O3), indicating a strongly reduced N leaching loss in the two systems based on fertility building crops (green manures and catch crops). In short, the main distinctions were not observed between organic and conventional systems (i.e. C vs. O1, O2 and O3). but between systems based mainly on nutrient import vs. systems based mainly on fertility building crops (C and O1 vs. O2 and O3).

AB  - The syn-tectonic Sobrarbe deltaic complex (Eocene of the Ainsa Basin, Spanish Pyrenees) is confined by lateral thrust ramps and influenced by intra-basinal growth anticlines. Six facies associations have been distinguished within the deltaic complex: (i) slope marls and turbidite sandstones; (ii) distal delta front silty and bioturbated sandstones; (iii) proximal delta front and delta plain deposits (tidal inlet, tidal flat, mouth-bar, bay, distributary channel, and floodplain environments); (iv) biogenic deposits at flooding surfaces; (v) collapse zone sediments; and (vi) Nummulite-dominated shallow-marine carbonates. The deltaic complex comprises four composite sequences, which each contain a number of minor sequences of the genetic (maximum flooding surface bounded) type. Regressive unconformities and their correlative surfaces separate the composite sequences (CS), and each CS can be divided into lowstand, transgressive and highstand components. At the base, the Comaron CS is a WNW-prograding deltaic complex containing six minor sequences characterized by basinward-stepping sandstone wedges separated by transgressive mudstones. Double regressive unconformities are often associated with these sandstone wedges proximally in the basin. Growth of the intra-basinal Arcusa anticline caused gentle folding of the Comaron CS, and syn-growth strata at the base of the overlying Las Gorgas CS contain a prominent forced regressive sandstone wedge (the Las Gorgas sandbody) and display thinning of bedsets onto the crest of the anticline. Moreover, it can be demonstrated that relative sea-level rise took place in the growth synclines at the same time as a fall in relative sea level occurred on the growth anticlines. The tectonic deformation caused a shift in the direction of deltaic progradation towards the north-northwest, as demonstrated by the well-developed clinoforms in the highstand sequence set of the Las Gorgas CS. A second phase of tectonic activity, this time triggering large-scale collapse of the delta front, occurred at the transition between the Las Gorgas and Barranco el Solano CS. Tilting of the basin floor led to the development of coeval transgressive and regressive strata separated by a fulcrum (line of zero net-vertical movement of the shoreline). In the post-tilt phase, reduced sediment supply and accelerated subsidence led to widespread transgression and a change from clastic- to carbonate-dominated sedimentation. This phase was terminated by a gradual increase in sediment supply causing progradation of a mixed elastic-carbonate system dominated by large Nummulite banks and bioturbated shoreface marls and sandstones. Finally, a pronounced fall in relative sea level associated with the transition to the Bull CS triggered slope instabilities and eventually established fluvial conditions all over the study area. With the exception of the anticline crests, the relatively high rate of tectonic subsidence in the study area suppressed relative sea-level falls, resulting in development of discontinuous lowstand strata and bounding surfaces. The segmented nature of many regressive unconformities may be related to incremental growth of thrust-related structures, and each segment is separated from neighbouring segments by gaps of limited vertical and lateral displacement. Precursors of progressive unconformities are seen in the upper proximal part of the Comaron CS by downdip 'fanning' and updip convergence of minor sequences. These differentially tilted stratal units provide reliable indicators of syn-sedimentary tectonism. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern processes of urbanization are shown as active power of socio-economic development, characterized by a number of contradictions and problems that require an integrated approach to their solution. These are burning problems conditioned with the necessity of transition of the domestic economy to the innovative way of development in line with the concept of innovation advancement, which is non-alternative for Ukraine. Consequently, the problem of determining effective methods of regulating the urbanization process occurs from the point of view of stimulating the regional innovation development of Ukraine, which will promote its socio-economic growth and further entering the world community of economically developed countries with high living standards.
   The purpose of this article is to study the impact of urbanization processes on the regional innovative development of Ukraine in order to develop recommendations for regulation of these processes and form an innovative environment in the regions.
   Results. The analysis of urbanization processes' influence on the innovative development of regions of Ukraine was carried out. The investigation substantiated that urbanization processes directly affect the economic development of the regions in innovative way. Main directions of such influence were determined. It was ascertained that the success of urbanization is practically impossible without application of modern innovative technologies, therefore urbanization activates processes of creation and introduction of innovations. The features of urbanization processes in Ukraine were outlined and main factors creating these features were determined. Based on the analysis of statistical data, urbanization processes were proved to have a direct impact on the indicators of innovative development of Ukrainian regions. In particular, an undoubted correlation between the indicators of the level of regional urbanization and figures of their innovative products, sold abroad, was substantiated. It was established that this influence is ambiguous for other indicators of innovation activity in the regions.
   Accordingly, tools and methods of regulating the urbanization processes should be chosen and applied appropriately to contribute to innovative development of the regions at a maximum extent. For this purpose, it is important to understand and correctly apply different types of regulators that link urbanization processes with innovative activity of the regions. The regulators of urbanization processes in the dimensions "innovative-spatial development" and "the state-a person" were systematized, the nature of these regulators' influence on innovative development of urbanization of Ukrainian regions was disclosed.
   The character of influence of social and cultural regulators on the formation of the regional innovative culture as the basis of innovative environment of the region was determined. It was shown that these regulators stimulate the development of components of the subsystems of the regional innovation culture: innovative, responsible for developing new types (models) of innovative regulation of urbanization processes based on own or borrowed experience; selective, responsible for selection of own or borrowed models of innovative regulation of urbanization processes that are relevant for a particular region (country); the transitive, responsible for consolidating and transferring models of innovative regulation of urbanization processes that have proved to be effective in practice from the past to present and from present to future.
   Further research should be aimed at developing a theoretical and methodological approach to modeling processes of urbanization in the regions of Ukraine from the perspective of maximizing their impact on the advanced innovative development of the respective regions.

AB  - Anthocyanins belong to a large group of secondary plant metabolites collectively known as flavonoids, a subclass of the polyphenol family. They are a group of very efficient bioactive compounds that are widely distributed in plant food. Anthocyanins occur in all plant tissues, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits. Research on phenolic compounds through the last century, from the chemical, biochemical, and biological points of view, has focused mainly on the anthocyanins. Anthocyanins have structures consisting of two aromatic rings linked by three carbons in an oxygenated heterocycle (i.e., a chromane ring bearing a second aromatic ring in position 2). The basic chromophore of anthocyanins is the 7-hydroxyflavilyum ion. Anthocyanin pigments consist of two or three chemical units: an aglycon base or flavylium ring (anthocyanidin), sugars, and possibly acylating groups. Only six of the different anthocyanidins found in nature occur frequently and are of dietary importance: cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin, pelargonidin, and malvidin. Each aglycon may be glycosilated or acylated by different sugars and aromatic or aliphatic acids, yielding over 600 different anthocyanins reported from plants. The sugar moiety is typically attached at the 3-position on the C-ring or the 5-position on the A-ring. The chromophore of eight conjugate double bonds carrying a positive charge on the heterocyclic oxygen ring is responsible for the intensive red-orange to blue-violet color produced by anthocyanins under acidic conditions. Anthocyanins occur in solution as a mixture of different secondary structures: flavylium ion, a quinoidal base, a carbinol base, and a chalcone pseudobase. Self-association, intermolecular, and intramolecular co-pigmentation of anthocyanins leads to the formation of tertiary structures through varying stabilization mechanisms. Anthocyanin composition has been used as a botanical tool for taxonomic classification of plants. In addition, anthocyanin profiles of fruits and vegetables allow detecting adulteration of anthocyanin-based products and are indicators of product quality. Anthocyanins are common components of the human diet, as they are present in many foods, fruits, and vegetables, especially in berries. Moreover, anthocyanins have an antioxidant activity, depending to a large extent upon their chemical structure. Many epidemiological studies have shown the benefits of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables to human health, and for the prevention of various diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Anthocyanin-rich extracts are increasingly attractive to the food industry as natural alternatives to synthetic FD&C dyes and lakes, because of their coloring properties. Anthocyanins are also one of the nine European Union-designated natural color classes. Various adverse effects on health have frequently been attributed to synthetic antioxidants. For these reasons, currently, there is a trend towards relying on antioxidants derived from natural products. Anthocyanins act as antioxidants both in the foodstuffs in which they are found and in the organism after intake of these foods.

AB  - Over the last decades ecologists have expressed a growing interest in studying the life-cycle responses of animals and plants to stress following global threats of climatic change and pollution. Subsequent reductions in population growth rate (lambda) are the result of stress-affected changes in various vital rates. At present it is unknown whether a stressful environment increases the sensitivity of lambda to changes in vital rates other than the ones which have been affected. In this paper we explore whether organisms exposed to anthropogenic pollutants are more sensitive to other environmentally induced life-cycle changes than prior to exposure. If so, this may enhance or reduce the direct effect of toxic substances at the population level. Since many soil organisms are continuously exposed to pollutants in the field we investigate the contributions of vital rates to lambda under different pollutant concentrations. Soil invertebrates with divergent life cycles were selected (the mite Platynothrus peltifer and the isopod Porcellio scaber exposed to cadmium, and the nematode Plectus acuminatus exposed to pentachlorophenol). Stage-structured matrix models were constructed based on experimental data sets and used to perform a perturbation analysis of lambda, i.e., to measure a proportional change in lambda resulting from a proportional change in vital rates (elasticity analysis). For Platynothrus peltifer cadmium had the largest effect on reproduction and a small impact on the survival over all stages except for the egg-stage resulting in a diminished lambda. However, lambda was most sensitive to changes in the duration of the egg stage followed by survival of the second nymph stage at all concentrations compared to the other stages. The elasticity of both stages increased at the highest cadmium concentration. For Porcellio scaber cadmium reduced the length of the juvenile period as well as reproduction. Under control conditions lambda was most sensitive to changes in the duration of the oocyte stage, followed by the duration of the first reproductive stage and survival of juveniles. At the highest cadmium concentration the duration of the oocyte stage was most important. For Plectus acuminatus pentachlorophenol strongly affected lambda, and the largest effect was found on egg survival. In the control treatment lambda was most sensitive to changes in juvenile survival, and the elasticity decreased with increasing pentachlorophenol concentrations in contrast to elasticity for the other traits. However at the highest concentration, when egg survival was nearly zero, juvenile survival was the most important trait. From these results it can be concluded that: (l) although there were differences in life cycles between species and types of stressors, in general lambda was most sensitive to changes in survival or duration of early-life stages, (2) the analyses of stress-induced life-cycle alterations indicate that the elasticity of lambda to changes in a particular rate was not related to the sensitivity of that rate to a toxicant, and (3) for all three species it appeared that a toxic environment switches the sensitivity of lambda to changes in vital rates.
   The results may have consequences for ecological risk assessment of pollutants. Our results imply that exposure to toxic compounds increases the sensitivity of organisms to stressors that affect vital rates other than the ones that have been affected by the toxicant. This aspect has largely been overlooked and requires more attention when the ultimate goal is to protect biodiversity from the impact of anthropogenic pollution.

AB  - The objective of the study was the composition of ash and slag waste from the Zmiiv TPP (thermal power plant) and the peculiarities of migration of heavy metals (HM) from the place of storage of ash and slag waste into the ecosystem. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: chemical analysis of ash and slag waste of the Zmiiv TPP; identification of the probability of HM migration into the soil environment in the places of ash and slag waste storage. Ash and slag of the Zmiiv TPP contain Cu, Cr, As, Cd, Ni, Pb in quantities several times higher than the threshold limit value (TLV). For ash and slag wastes, the total pollution rate was Zc = 43, which corresponds to a high level. That is, this artificial horizon is dangerous. HMs migrate to groundwater and soils near the ash stockpiles as a result of infiltration of precipitation waters, leaks from water-bearing communications, water filtration through the base of the ash stockpiles of the Zmiiv TPP. To determine soil contamination near the ash stockpiles, we analyzed soil at the distances of 0, 5, 10, 50 and 100 meters. The contents of the HM decreased further away from the stockpil es . At the distance of up to 100 meters from the dump, there were excesses of the threshold limit values for Ni, Cu, As, Cr in the soil. The concentration factor exceeded one for Cr, As, Cu, Cd, Ni. Only at the distance of 100 meters did the contents of Pb and Zn reached the background values. The calculation of the total rate of soil contamination allowed us to classify these soils as moderately dangerous and acceptable. However, the Zn indicator has several significant disadvantages, particularly it does not take into account the differences in the potential hazards of the elements, as well as, most importantly, the synergistic effects of polymetallic pollution. The coefficient of synergistic effect of heavy metals was 26.64 (in the soil of the ash stockpiles), then decreased, but even at the distance of 100 meters it equaled 11.23, i.e. at the distance of 0... 100 m from the ash stockpiles, the overall actions exceed the norm. The study revealed that Cu, Ni, 7,n and Cr had low mobility in the soil near the ash stockpiles and therefore accumulated near the stockpiles, which may be explained by neutral and slightly alkaline soil pH values. The ratio of mineral phases and glass varied, but we should note the predominance of aluminosilicates, calcium silicates and glass in the ash and slag wastes. Heavy metal compounds are confined mainly to amorphized clay aggregates and soot-coal ash formation, to a lesser extent to slag glass and even less to grains of quartz sand. Since ash contains such fractions that can be easily carried by the wind, it should be assumed that ingress of HM into the ecosystem occurs by air, which also contributes to air pollution. The solution to the problem of ash and slag waste disposal can be found in their utilization in the production of construction materials, in road construction, but it is necessary to study the composition of ash and slag and the probability of migration of HM depending on the conditions of use.

AB  - The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Five priority areas of potential impact by contaminants (API) were investigated at the Presidente Bernardes Refinery in Cubatao, Sao Paulo, Brazil with the following aims: (i) to identify both organic and inorganic contaminants present in soil and groundwater; (ii) to define the environmental conditions relevant for microbial activity at the site and (iii) to evaluate the feasibility of employing natural attenuation for treatment of the hydrocarbon contamination. One area (API 1) was an uncontrolled landfill, where waste materials from the refinery were deposited between 1954 and 1986, and four areas (API 4, 5, 7 and 11) were located in the operational section of the refinery. Soil contamination by regulated BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, total xylenes) was restricted to two samples from API 1. Nonregulated ethylbenzene was detected in one soil sample from API 4, one from API 5 and two from API 1. No soil contained regulated PAH above threshold levels. Several nonregulated PAHs were found in 6 soil samples from API 1, 3 soil samples from API 4 and 1 soil sample from API 5. Site soils contained very high aluminium concentrations, but metal contamination was restricted to one soil sample from API 1, which contained nickel above threshold limits. BTEX contamination of groundwater was due mostly to benzene. Of the 17 PAH molecules tested, only naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene occurred in groundwater. The sum of total BTEX and total PAH exceeded 200 mu g/L in only a few monitoring wells in API 4, 5 and 11 and was always below 2.640 mu g/L. Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Se, Ag, Tl and Zn were not detected in groundwater, which was contaminated in a few locations by aluminium (mostly below 1 mg/L), lead (< 0.066 mg/L) and arsenic (< 0.056 mg/L). S, K, Ca, Mg and Fe were present in groundwater in excess of physiological requirements for microbial growth, but low concentrations of N and P could become growth limiting. However, BTEX were efficiently degraded in saturated and unsaturated zone microcosms and nutrient amendments did not stimulate biodegradation rates measurably. The inorganic carbon pool in groundwater was up to one order of magnitude larger than the organic carbon pool. Total inorganic carbon (TIC) in API groundwater exceeded TIC of clean groundwater by factors of 2 (API 4), 6 (API 5, 7 and 11) or 10 (API 1). Most of the inorganic carbon incorporated into groundwater beneath the refinery originated from biodegradation in the unsaturated soil, which contained a microbiota (10(6) cells/g on average) capable of growth with most of the pure (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) and mixed hydrocarbons tested (diesel oil, gasoline, naphtha, condensate, aromatic residue and fuel oil). A viscous hydrocarbon paste uncovered in API 1 was insoluble in water but dissolved in dichloromethane. Many organic components of this paste were biodegradable as evidenced by weight reduction of the hydrocarbon paste and by the growth of suspended and attached biomass in saturated zone microcosms, where the paste was the only carbon source. This study indicates that monitored natural attenuation may be a technically feasible and efficient means for plume control in API 1, 4 and 5, provided the plumes in API 4 and 5 are not expanding. This technique is not suitable for contaminant reduction in API 11.

CP  - 3rd MARAQUA Workshop on the Monitoring and Regulation of Marine Aquaculture
KW  - MARINE AQUACULTURE
KW  - REGULATIONS
AB  - A range of chemicals are used in European marine aquaculture and these may be categorized as disinfectants, antifoulants and medicines (includes vaccines). This article provides a review of chemicals used in aquaculture in Europe, their regulatory status, and a checklist of points considered best practice in the use (and avoidance of use) of medicines in marine aquaculture. The release of antifoulants and disinfectants into the marine environment is controlled by local and/or national waste discharge regulations that may in turn be guided by wider environmental quality objectives. The authorization of veterinary medicines, biologicals (vaccines) and pharmaceuticals (chemicals), in Europe is the subject of several EC Directives. Registration dossiers address the issues of product quality, safety and efficacy and include environmental and consumer safety where the product is destined for use in a food-producing animal. Fish farmers, like all livestock producers, must have access to a range of properly authorized medicines to safeguard animal health and welfare. The distribution and supply of medicines must be appropriately controlled and their authorization appropriately includes environmental risk assessment to a common European Union (EU) or international standard.
   There is progress towards the harmonization of the authorization process within the EU and this will help to ensure the continued availability of medicines for fish. Consumer safety is addressed by the setting of maximum residue limits (MRLs) derived through toxicological risk assessment and by surveillance of food for residues of veterinary medicines. The system for the environmental risk assessment of chemicals used in aquaculture is being developed and is outlined in the present article.
   It is recommended that the supply and use of fish medicines is uniformly regulated in the EU and supported by appropriate codes of best practice. A number of codes of practice that include reference to the use of medicines have been produced both at a European level and in member states, It is recommended that all European marine aquaculture producers adopt a code of best practice for the use of medicinal and other chemicals their industry. Medicines are one part of an integrated package in dealing with animal health. This includes environmental conditions, nutrition and hygiene. The best practice guidelines presented here are based on the outcome of three European workshops as part of the EU MARAQUA project that involved industry, government and research scientists. They cover the avoidance and minimizing of the need to use medicines and other chemicals, to recording and monitoring their use and effectiveness (in case of resistance development), exchange of experiences within the industry, and staff training. Recommendations are also included for manufacturers of medicines and other chemicals, and for regulatory authorities. Minimizing the need to use medicines and other chemicals requires attention to a healthy source of fish stock. Staff must be appropriately trained in fish husbandry (to minimize stress), hygiene and disease recognition and treatment, including management of the farm site to keep it disease free. The latter may require single generations of fish per site to allow a fallow period during which a disease or parasite cycle is broken. These recommendations and guidelines are in accordance with the current codes of practice being developed by different sectors of the aquaculture industry in different countries. They do not necessarily involve significantly higher production costs and indeed are more likely to save costs as medicines and disease impacts are very costly to industry.

AB  - The pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl) tree dieback phenomenon presents an economic as well as ecologic problem. Factors that cause tree dieback can be biotic, biotopic (within habitat) and structural (within stand),In managedforests, the volume of dead trees or volume of trees cut in a sanitation harvests are most often used to show the intensity of tree dieback, and may also be used as an indicator of the stands condition (Capecki, 1981).Every species has its own ecological niche. Forest tree species have varying reactions to changes in environmental factors, to stress and ultimately to dying. The study was conducted in Zelenika" management unit in Posavina.The aims of the study were to establish pedunculate oak and narrow-leaved ash tree dieback dynamics, to research the influence of biotopic and structural factors on dieback intensity and to compare dieback intensities according to the stand age class and microrelief. For analysis were climatic data for Novska meteorological station, water level data of Novska watercourse, and groundwater level data from Zelenika" piezometric station were used. Dry years and dry periods, and wet years and wet periods, were determined using the percentile method and the Walter climate diagrams.
   Growing volume of withered pedunculate oak and ash trees, as well as structural factors data (stand structure elements) were collected from the 0-2 form of the Forest management plan. Dieback intensities were calculated on the basis of growing volume of the withered trees per area unit ratio. The intensity of tree death was shown in absolute numbers, as m(3)/ha (Siwecki et al. 1998).
   Considering the average change rate, dieback intensities of pedunculate oak and narrow-leaved ash tree are increasing. The highest dieback intensities for both forest species were found in the VI age class (Figure 2). On the basis of the conducted research, it can be concluded that climatic, hydrological and structural factors influence pedunculate oak and narrow-leaved ash tree dieback.
   Pedunculate oak is more sensitive to climatic elements in comparison to narrow-leaved ash tree. Frequent dry years significantly affected the dying of these two species, which can both be considered hydrophytes in terms of their ecological demand for water. The results of this study showed that narrow-leaved ash was more vulnerable to drought than pedunculate oak.
   Drought and rain periods also significantly influence tree dieback (table 5). The effect of dry periods on the die back of these two species was greater in relation to the lack of wet periods in these lowland forests. The decrease of mid and minimal water levels of watercourse influenced pedunculate oak dieback, while adecrease of maximum watercourse water levels influenced narrow-leaved ash tree dieback (table 6). Groundwater level decrease in deeper layers of pedosphere had asignificant influence on tree dieback intensities (table 7). It was revealed that all structural factors influence pedunculate oak dieback, while narrow-leaved ash tree dieback was influenced only by stocking and tree number increase in a stand (table 8).The dieback of pedunculate oak was higher in older stands. No correlation was detected between the dieback of narrow-leafed ash and stand age.

However, few studies have investigated the real-time pedestrian safety model. Intersections usually have mixed traffic conditions with more pedestrian-vehicle interactions. This paper uses conflict indicators, PET (Post Encroachment Time) and TTC (Time to Collision) to identify pedestrians' conflicts from CCTV (closed-circuit television) videos. The high-resolution traffic data from the Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) system are used to derive traffic flow-related variables. The pedestrian exposure is also estimated. Pedestrians' conflicts are predicted using multiple machine learning models and Logistic Regression. The resampling methods, random over-sampling, and random under-sampling are compared. The best model, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBT) with random over-sampling method can achieve AUC (area under the ROC curve) value of 0.841 and recall value of 0.739 on the test data set. The proposed model can predict pedestrians' conflicts one cycle ahead, which can be 2-3 min. The proposed model has the potential to be implemented in the Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) environment to adjust signal timing accordingly and enhance traffic safety.

AB  - The increasingly severe emissions of greenhouse and poisonous gases from environmentally unsafe stockpiled coal mine waste dumps have urged people from the academia as well as the industry to focus on environmental impact assessment. In this study, one-year air pollutant monitoring was conducted at the Qipanjing coalfield in Inner Mongolia of China for determining the distribution pattern statue of pollutant exposure and its main driving factors. We used FTIR spectroscopy to measure the inorganic compounds in particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 mu m. The spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of leading pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O-3 and CO were analyzed. Firstly, the research showed that the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants in the coal mine waste area is non-homogeneous. Secondly, some meteorological parameters, such as wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, and rainfall, were found to have significant effects on air pollutant distribution. Stable atmospheric conditions were unfavorable for the diffusion of pollutants and prolong the pollution process. Finally, in the vicinity of coalfields, SO2 and NO2 are present in high concentrations in air. Primary reasons for such high values are coal mining-related activities and active mine fires. This study will help to offer valuable and detailed information for understanding and interpreting the pollution source.

AB  - Nutrients are a fundamental determinant of broad scale patterns in the benthic algal community of stream ecosystems. Excessive inputs of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into upland streams may result in significant impacts on benthic algal communities. In upland streams, diatoms are the most abundant and diverse taxonomic group in benthic algal communities. In this study, benthic algal biomass and diatom community responses to in sins nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment were investigated by conducing an in-stream nutrient diffusing substrate experiment at high and low ambient nutrient concentration sites. Nitrogen was found to be the primary limiting nutrient across all sites, regardless of the ambient nutrient concentrations. In general, enrichment relieved nutrient limitation, promoting the dominance of a smaller suite of eutrophic species in the community. This was particularly evident in the low ambient nutrient sites where oligotrophic species initially dominated the community. This study identified diatom species with competitive advantage under nutrient enriched conditions and further the understanding of diatom species competition for multiple nutrients. Five diatom nutrient trait groups differentiate nutrient generalists and specialists and identifies potential indicator species based on their responses to specific enrichment treatments.

AB  - The animal's blood is the most complicated and important biological liquid for veterinary medicine. In addition to standard methods that are always in use, recent technologies such as dynamic tensiometry (DT) of blood serum and PCR analysis of particular markers are in progress. The standard and modern biochemical tests are commonly used for general screening and, finally, complete diagnosis of animal health. Interpretation of major biochemical parameters is similar across animal species, but there are a few peculiarities in each case, especially well-known for cattle. The following directions are discussed here: hematological indicators; "total protein" and its fractions; some enzymes; major low-molecular metabolites (glucose, lipids, bilirubin, etc.); cations and anions. As example, the numerous correlations between DT data and biochemical parameters of cattle serum have been obtained and discussed. Changes in the cell-free nucleic acids (cfDNA) circulating in the blood have been studied and analyzed in a variety of conditions; for example, pregnancy, infectious and chronic diseases, and cancer. CfDNA can easily be detected using standard molecular biological techniques like DNA amplification and next-generation sequencing. The application of digital PCR even allows exact quantification of copy number variations which are for example important in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal aberrations.

AB  - The influence of momentary experiences on compliance has not yet been studied extensively in diary methods such as the experience sampling method (ESM). This study investigated to what extent momentary experiences at the moment of responding (hereafter `beep') can predict compliance in high frequency ESM protocols. Lagged-analyses were conducted using a pooled dataset of seven studies including 1,318 healthy volunteers and individuals with different mental health conditions. All studies used an ESM design of 10 beeps per day over 4 to 6 days. Overall compliance was 86% (to beeps where a subject was compliant at the previous beep). Results indicated that participants who reported higher positive affect overall were more compliant. Feeling disturbed by a beep, being outside the home, medication use, or longer inter-prompt interval decreased the chances of compliance to the subsequent beep. While participants with depression tended to be more compliant, chances to be compliant decreased in the evenings and over the course of the study days. When more beeps were missed consecutively, the chances to miss the subsequent beep increased. Findings suggest that disturbance of the beep, being outside the home, medication use, and inter-prompt interval might decrease the chances of compliance to the subsequent beep.

AB  - BACKGROUND Animal manure is one of the significant sources of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and an emerging pollutant that poses a threat to human beings. Composting is a common method of treating manure. The effect of composting on the ARGs in manure has become an active research area in recent years. In this study, three common aeration strategies were used to study the removal of ARGs and to clarify their microbial mechanism during composting, i.e. forced aeration (with three ventilation rates), turn windrow and static pile. RESULTS Results showed that the variation pattern of ARGs was highly dependent on the succession of the microbial community, and environmental factors accounted for 44% of the variation. Most ARGs (tetW/tetO/tetH, qnrS, ermB and blaTEM) could be significantly reduced after composting for 77 days, but sulfonamide resistance genes (sulI/sulII) and the integrase gene (intI) were highly enriched, particularly in forced aeration treatment. These enrichments were closely correlated with an increase in the genera belonging to Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the genera affiliated with Firmicutes. CONCLUSIONS The temporal variations in ARGs were consistent under different aeration treatments. Further study should focus on optimizing the composting conditions to reduce recalcitrant ARGs.

AB  - The level of general immunological reactivity of birds can be judged by the concentration of leukocytes in the bloodstream. The number of white cells is associated not only with the level of defense of the body of turkeys, but also with its reactivity to environmental factors, determining the activity and direction of metabolic processes. The purpose of the work is to study the characteristics of the immunological reactivity indices of turkeys of different origin and crosses in dynamics depending on age. Assessment of the physiological state of turkey poults during cultivation under industrial conditions by the variability of morphological blood parameters and the level of immunological reactivity showed, that they all fluctuate within the normal range. At the same time, the value of blood parameters depends on the age of the bird and the genotype, determined by both the breed and the cross. The level of immunological reactivity of turkeys, due to the number of leukocytes in the blood, depends on age and cross-country. According to this indicator, birds of medium (group I) and heavy crosses of the White broad-chested breed are superior to individuals of medium crosses Hybrid Greyd Maker (III group) and heavy crosses Hybrid Converter (IV group) by 3.04-14.47% depending on age.

AB  - Antibiotics have assumed importance in the scene of medicine due to their activity against bacterial infections. During the course of evolution, bacteria have been developing routes to overcome damaging effects of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is an intriguing development that has taken the world of anti-microbial therapy by storm. Among the methods described in literature for assessing anti-microbial activity, those using metabolic activity as a measure of bacterial viability provide estimates closer to the actual. The dye reduction-based electron-transfer activity monitoring assay (DREAM assay) utilizes the redox dye methylene blue as an indicator of microbial activity. The DREAM assay coefficient is presented herein as a measure of the extent of microbial reduction of methylene blue to a colorless form under experimental conditions. This novel metric was successfully employed to evaluate activity of three common antibiotics-ampicillin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin-and leaf extracts of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum. Results corroborated significantly with the conventional disk diffusion method commonly used for anti-microbial testing. The principle of microbial electron transfer was then successfully extended to assess antibiotic susceptibility of known resistant and sensitive strains of Escherichia coli. This method possesses the advantage of detecting anti-microbial activity in a simple, cost-effective, and rapid manner.

AB  - The photosynthetic activity of sweet potato leaves was determined under field experiment during 2015-2017 in Zyznow (49 degrees 49' N, 21 degrees 50' E), using split-plot design in three replicates. The experiment included doses of nitrogen (0, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha(-1)) and three sweet potato varieties (Beauregard, Carmen Rubin, and White Triumph). The aim was to establish the interactive effect on the physiological activity of sweet potato leaves ordered in the following way: environmental conditions > years x varieties > varieties > years x fertilisation > fertilisation x varieties > fertilisation > years x varieties x fertilisation. Genetic features of the studied varieties had a significant influence on physiological indicators, as. minimum fluorescence efficiency (F-o); maximum fluorescence efficiency (F-m); maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m) PSII efficiency on the light (F-v,/F-m,) and the actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (Y). Nitrogen fertilisation decreased in the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) which, affected the actual photochemical efficiency of PSII related to the electron transport efficiency (Y). The interaction of variety x fertilisation had the greatest influence on determining the minimum value of chlorophyll fluorescence, whereas the interaction of years x variety x fertilisation, had strong influence on the non-photochemical fluorescence quenching of chlorophyll (qN).

AB  - Premature failures in chemically stabilized expansive soils cost millions of dollars in maintenance and repair. One reason for these failures is the inability of existing stabilization design guidelines to take into account the complex interactions between the clay minerals and the stabilizers. It is vital to understand these complex interactions, as they are responsible for the improved strength and reduction of swelling/shrinking in these soils, which in turn affects the overall health of the infrastructure. This research study examined the longevity of chemically stabilized expansive soils subjected to wetting/drying conditions, with a major focus on clay mineralogy. Eight different natural soils with varying clay mineralogy were subjected to wetting/drying durability studies after they were stabilized with chemical additives including quicklime and cement. Performance indicators such as volumetric strain and unconfined compressive strength trends were monitored at regular intervals during the wetting/drying process. It was observed that clayey soils dominant in the mineral montmorillonite were susceptible to premature failures. It was also noted that soils dominant in other clay minerals exhibited early failures at lower additive contents. For the first time, an attempt was made to address the field implications of the laboratory studies by developing a correlation that predicts service life in the field based on clay mineralogy and stabilizer dosage.

AB  - Rice is the basis of diet for almost half of the world population, and its culture is one of the strategic agroindustrial production chains in the agribusiness environment, in both economic and social levels. Thus, the comparative analysis between the production chains of rice milled in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, and Uruguay was mainly motivated by the interest in knowing the differences in the business environment and public policies that impact the competitiveness of this chain in both study regions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the economic efficiency, competitiveness, and effects of public policies of the rice production chain of milled rice in RS (Brazil) relative to Uruguay. The data collected in this study are from the 2011-2012 harvests and indicators were calculated by applying the concepts of the policy analysis matrix (PAM). Results showed that the chains in both study regions were competitive under the existing market and policy conditions, revealed comparative advantage, transferred a high load of resources to other sectors of the economy, and satisfactorily remuneration of the domestic production factors. However, the competitiveness and comparative advantage shown in this study were not due to the encouraging intervention policies, as both production systems pay high taxes.

AB  - Osteological lesions can be important to positively identify human remains in forensic contexts, as well as contribute to past population studies. However, their analysis requires training and appropriate research conditions, which may be lacking in certain geographic areas as, for example, the northern region of Brazil. Emphasising existing resources, such as anatomical collections, may help to address this issue. This study explores the anatomical collection of Professor Dr. Manuel da Silva Braga of the Federal University of Para (Brazil), introducing the traumatic lesions identified in seven crania (13.7%; 7/51) of male (four) and female (three) individuals. The sample profile and the cases identified are in accordance with the pattern of violent victims in the region. This study is the first of its kind in the Para State, contributing with case studies and examples, to the disciplines of biological anthropology, paleopathology, and bioarchaeology and forensic discipline. It also highlights the significance that anatomical collections may have in the development of those disciplines, suggesting a need for reappraisal and reevaluation of existing resources, as these may be of use for training and research. Lastly, this study builds a bridge towards the social and cultural context of the collection, reinforcing the value of an interdisciplinary approach to human remains.

AB  - We compared canopy arthropod responses to common fuels reduction treatments at Teakettle Experimental Forest in the south-central Sierra Nevada of California. We sampled arthropod communities among four dominant overstory conifer species and three dominant understory angiosperm species before and after overstory or understory thinning or no thinning treatments followed by burning or no burning treatments. Arthropods were sampled in overstory trees by climbing and bagging foliage-bearing branches and counting all arthropods by taxon in each sample. Understory plants were sampled similarly from the ground. Arthropod assemblages showed significant differences among tree species and seasons, but not among treatment combinations. Taxa showing significant differences in abundance among plant species likely reflected differences in foliage quality or other host-associated conditions among plant species. Some arthropods showed significant value as indicator species. Overall, our results indicated that the restoration treatments recommended for Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests have little effect on associated canopy arthropods. However, given the significant differences in arthropod assemblages among plant species, restoration treatments should ensure that the full range of plant species characterizing these forests is maintained in order to protect their associated arthropods.

AB  - New data are obtained on the major-component and minor- and trace-element composition of metamorphosed gabbronorites and Fe-Ti gabbro in the Krasnaya Guba area, Belomorian Mobile Belt. These two magmatic complexes, which are spatially combined but are of different age and were produced in different geodynamic environments, were simultaneously metamorphosed in the Paleoproterozoic to parameters transitional between the amphibolite and eclogite facies. Eclogite metamorphism was associated with perceivable changes in the concentrations of alkalis and alkali earth elements, and the metamorphic transformation of the plagioclase eclogite (which can be metamorphosed gabbronorite and/or gabbro) into amphibolite and biotite amphibolite was associated with changes in the concentrations of practically all trace elements. This implies that the metamorphic processes were not isochemical and were accompanied by significant removal and introduction of incompatible elements. However, some trace-element ratios (such as Ti/Y, Ti/Zr, Zr/Y, La/Sm, and Nb/Th) remained unmodified in the course of metamorphism and remained the same as in the pristine gabbronorite or gabbro and likely can be employed as indicators of the composition of the probable protolith and the conditions under which it was produced.

AB  - Routine metabolic rate (RMR, mgO(2) g(-1) h(-1)) and critical oxygen concentration (Pc, a hypoxia tolerance indicator, mgO(2) L-1) were determined in larvae and juveniles of round crucian carp, Carassius auratus grandoculis Temminck & Schlegel 1846, by measuring oxygen consumption at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 30 degrees C. In addition, the dependence of RMR and Pc on fish body weight (W, g) and temperature (T, degrees C) was examined to construct minimal mathematical models. RMR depended on W and showed smaller values in larger individuals. RMR was different among the three temperature conditions and showed higher values at higher temperatures. Pc was significantly related to W and was low in larger individuals; that is, larger individuals had a higher hypoxia tolerance. In contrast, Pc was independent of temperature, implying that seasonal temperature fluctuations do not cause seasonal disequilibrium of hypoxia tolerance in round crucian carp. The RMR and Pc models were RMR = 0.0674W(-0.193)e(0.0562T) and Pc = 1.35W(-0.107), respectively. The metabolic information clarified in this study is essential for habitat quality assessments and aquaculture management of this species.

AB  - Xylanase is a crucial hydrolytic enzyme that degrades plant polysaccharides in the rumen. To date, there is no information on the genetic composition and expression characteristics of ruminal xylanase during feeding cycles of ruminants. Here, the major xylanase of the glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH 10) from the rumen of small-tail Han sheep was investigated during a feeding cycle. We identified 44 distinct GH 10 xylanase gene fragments at both the genomic and transcriptional levels. Comparison of their relative abundance showed that results from the evaluation of functional genes at the transcriptional level are more reliable indicators for understanding fluctuations in xylanase levels. The expression patterns of six xylanase genes, detected at all time points of the feeding cycle, were investigated; we observed a complex trend of gene expression over 24 h, revealing the dynamic expression of xylanases in the rumen. Further correlation analysis indicated that the rumen is a dynamic ecosystem where the transcript profiles of xylanase genes are closely related to ruminal conditions, especially rumen pH and bacterial population. Given the huge diversity and changing composition of enzymes over the entire rumen, this research provides valuable information for understanding the role of functional genes in the digestion of plant material.

AB  - Knowledge and capacity development (KCD) is increasingly acknowledged as critical for water supply development. Since KCD aims to improve institutional performance, it is often measured using technical performance targets. This paper cautions about the misleading nature of this measurement. The authors argue that technical performance improvement should be separated from competence development because the latter does not always directly translate into the former in a short time period. Drawing on empirical evidence about the management contract between Aqua Vitens Rand Limited and Ghana Water Company Limited, the paper demonstrates how the process of integrating and using competences is a necessary condition before KCD interventions can result in performance improvement. As this process often takes time, KCD providers and beneficiaries should set realistic performance targets. Not doing so creates unrealistic expectations and often leads to underestimation of the actual impact. This paper finds that knowledge management concepts common in the private sector are equally applicable in the public sector but that the latter may be constrained by short term goals and lack of insight in management processes. It is concluded that technical performance-based assessments should be complemented by capacity-based assessments in order to show fairly the contribution of KCD interventions.

AB  - Biological soil crusts take a long time to recover after soil disturbance but data on the rate and trajectory of crust recovery are lacking. Using a space-for-time chronosequence of time-since-cultivation, we assessed the recovery of crust diversity and cover in semi-arid grasslands in southern Australia. Using sites that spanned from recently-cultivated to never-cultivated, we show that the recovery of soil crust cover is highly variable with time-since-cultivation; recently-cultivated sites generally had the lowest total cover of biological soil crusts and morphological type diversity relative to sites allowed to recover for >= 60 yrs. Moss, liverworts, squamulose and crustose lichens return to grasslands quickly after cultivation, but cover returned at highly variable rates; this might reflect that other factors (stock grazing, microtopography, soils) also affect crust cover recovery. Our results suggest that soil crusts are initially slow to recover after soil disturbance. However, post-cultivation recovery does occur but this is in the context of historical and spatial contingencies. The patterns of cover and diversity that we observed provide a useful way to interpret effects of disturbance on semi-arid grasslands in Australia and may be useful indicators of grassland condition where cultivation history is not known.

AB  - In Greece, as in many other Mediterranean countries, there is a lack of information enabling the use of aquatic macrophytes as biological indicators of the water trophic status. This research aimed to investigate the trophic preferences of the aquatic macrophyte assemblages encountered in selected standing water bodies of a lowland river basin of western Greece. It also aimed to assess the response of the macrophyte species that occur in the studied water bodies to different nutrient concentrations. A total of 56 macrophyte species were identified. TWINSPAN analysis distinguished four main vegetation groups potentially related to three trophic types. The Trophic Ranking Score developed in the UK was applied in order to investigate the trend in aquatic macrophytes in response to the different trophic conditions. The results indicated that TRSUK was not in accordance to the water trophic indices. After the addition of 14 new species and the re-scoring of the plants from the UK list, the re-calculation of TRS enabled a better classification of the trophic status convergent with the information from the water trophic indices. The current study constitutes a reference document providing basic information, and must be improved by updating the plant list with new data from other sites.

AB  - Most theoretical models for the evolution of senescence have assumed a very large, well mixed population. Here, we investigate how limited dispersal and kin competition might influence the evolution of ageing by deriving indicators of the force of selection, similar to Hamilton (Hamilton 1966 J. Theor. Biol. 12, 12-45). Our analytical model describes how the strength of selection on survival and fecundity changes with age in a patchy population, where adults are territorial and a fraction of juveniles disperse between territories. Both parent-offspring competition and sib competition then affect selection on age-specific life-history traits. Kin competition reduces the strength of selection on survival. Mutations increasing mortality in some age classes can even be favoured by selection, but only when fecundity deteriorates rapidly with age. Population structure arising from limited dispersal however selects for a broader distribution of reproduction over the lifetime, potentially slowing down reproductive senescence. The antagonistic effects of limited dispersal on age schedules of fecundity and mortality cast doubts on the generality of conditions allowing the evolution of 'suicide genes' that increase mortality rates without other direct pleiotropic effects. More generally, our model illustrates how limited dispersal and social interactions can indirectly produce patterns of antagonistic pleiotropy affecting vital rates at different ages.

AB  - We quantified Neobenedenia melleni from the skin of Caribbean surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) from June through October 2005 and 2007. Prevalence, or mean intensity of infection, or both, varied significantly among the 3 species, and among sites and between years for the most heavily infected species, blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus). Among 6 sites sampled, no more than 12% of ocean surgeonfish (Acanthurus babianus) were infected, compared with 10 to 100% of A. coeruleus. The prevalence of infection among doctorfish (Acanthurus chirurgus), collected at only I of the sites, was intermediate between the other 2 species (46%). Mean intensity (range) of infection for the few infected A. bahianus was 1 (1) to 3 (1-8), compared with 1.3 (1-2) to 14.3 (1-59) for A. coeruleus, and 2.5 (1-8) for A. chirurgus. Expected abundance of N. melleni on A. coeruleus from shallow bay sites was greater than for those from non-bay sites. Higher infections on A. coeruleus may be attributable to differences in habitat use, or susceptibility to infection, or both, compared to other species. Among site and between-year differences may be associated with differences in benthic habitat, or water conditions, or both. This system seems ideal for future comparative studies on the relationship between environmental variables and parasites on Caribbean coral reefs.

AB  - In Brazil, afforestation programs use mainly eucalyptus and it has been frequently questioned due to possible changes in the soil caused by this exotic tree species. The impact of land use changes can vary with climate conditions and soil, and results obtained in a specific area may not be extrapolated to the supra-regional level. Biomass and microbial activity have been suggested as appropriate indicators of soil disturbance caused by management techniques. In this study, these characteristics were used to evaluate changes in forest litter and soil where the native forest was replaced by eucalyptus plantations in four southeastern areas of Brazil. The amounts of forest litter were higher in eucalyptus stands than in the native forest due to the higher C:N ratio of the material. The impact of the conversion of native forest into eucalyptus stands on soil and forest floor properties varied in the site-specific characteristics analyzed. Differences between the contents of microbial biomass C and N in eucalypt and native vegetation were more frequently observed in the soil than in forest litter. Forest litter microbial biomass represented a larger reservoir of C and N than soil microbial biomass, representing a relevant component for C and N cycling in these ecosystems.

AB  - In the absence of water-quality data, a biological indicator is the only way to estimate the pollution level. Samples of macrophytes from exposed shallow rocky substrata of the region of Algiers (Algeria, Mediterranean Sea) were collected in supposedly (in the absence of available pollution data) polluted and pristine waters. These samples were compared to a set of samples spanning a known pollution gradient found near Marseilles (France) and to some samples from a variety of other Mediterranean localities. All samples were collected in similar conditions. The diversity point (i.e., the number of species per sample) was not greater at Cherchell (control site) than at the three sites in the Bay of Algiers. Analysis of the dataset was successful in ranking the Algerian sites, but failed to calibrate the pollution level of the Algerian sites by inserting Algerian samples within the pollution gradient of Marseilles. In contrast, regional characteristics of the macrophyte communities appear to be largely prevalent. This means that water-quality biological indicators and indices based upon marine macrophytes, at least for the open waters and exposed shallow Mediterranean habitats studied here, could be reliable within a given region, but may require validation and/or adjustment, perhaps considerable, for other regions.

AB  - The application of geochemical tracers in groundwater studies can provide valuable insights into the rates and sources of groundwater recharge, residence times, and flow dynamics that are of significant value in the management of this important natural resource. This paper demonstrates the application of noble gas excess air to distinguish groundwater bodies with different recharge histories in a layered sandstone aquifer system in the east of England. The sampled groundwaters are all supersaturated with respect to neon, indicating the presence of excess air. The lowest excess air concentrations occur where the aquifer is unconfined (Delta Ne, the proportion of neon in excess of saturation, = 12-26%) and recharge occurs directly to the outcrop. Groundwater in the confined part of the aquifer can be divided into two hydrochemical types based upon the dissolved ion chemistry: Type 1 groundwaters contain more excess air (Delta Ne = 115-120%) than Type 2 (Delta Ne = 22-62%). The difference in excess air concentrations confirms that groundwater enters the confined aquifer along two discrete pathways. Furthermore, excess neon concentrations predicted from the magnitude of annual water table fluctuation observed in the different recharge areas are in good agreement with those measured in the corresponding groundwaters. We therefore recommend that excess air may be usefully employed as a direct indicator of the volume of long-term net annual groundwater recharge.

AB  - Spirotox is a short-term acute toxicity test with a large ciliated protozoan Spirostomum ambiguum. The test was created in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland, during the early 1990s. It was presented for the first time during the 6th International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment, in Berlin in 1993. S. ambiguum was very resistant to a wide range of environmental conditions, especially to pH and dissolved oxygen. Over the last 10 years the sensitivity of S. ambiguum to many classes of toxicants was evaluated. Spirotox was found to be very sensitive to heavy metals, fungicides, and pharmaceuticals used to cure diseases of the human nervous system. On the other hand, it was generally less sensitive than standard bioassays to simple organics. Spirotox was also used for analysis of cyanobacterial blooms. Though it was moderately sensitive to hepatotoxins, the test seems to be a good tool for evaluation of the entire toxicity of blooms. The last but not the least of the applications of the Spirotox test was evaluation of the toxicity of extracts from medical devices. Protozoa, which are the simplest eukaryotes, seem to be good screening bioassays for monitoring the technology of medical device production. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A soil physical parameter, S, is defined. It is equal to the slope of the soil water retention curve at its inflection point. This curve must be plotted as the logarithm (to base e) of the water potential against the gravimetric water content (kg kg(-1)). The value of S is indicative of the extent to which the soil porosity is concentrated into a narrow range of pore sizes. In most soils, lamer values of S are consistent with the presence of a better-defined microstructure. Much previous work has shown that this microstructure is responsible for most of the soil physical properties that are necessary for the proper functioning of soil in agriculture and the environment. The use of S is illustrated with examples of soils with different texture, density (or degree of compaction), and organic matter (OM) content. The effects of S on root growth in soil are investigated, and S is shown to be a better indicator of soil rootability than bulk density. It is suggested that S can be used as an index of soil physical quality that enables different soils and the effects of different management treatments and conditions to be compared directly.

AB  - Woodland colonization on wetlands is considered to have a detrimental effect on their ecological value, even though detailed analysis of this process is lacking. This paper provides an evaluation of the ecological changes resulting from succession of poor fen (base-poor mire) to willow wet woodland on Goss Moor NNR in Cornwall, UK. Different ages of willow carr were associated with eight understorey communities. During willow colonization, in the ground flora, there was a progressive decrease in poor fen species and an associated increase in woodland species, which appeared to be related to an increase in canopy cover and therefore shade. The most diverse community was found to be the most recent willow and was dominated by poor fen species. The oldest willow was the second most diverse and was associated with a reduction in poor fen species and an increase in woodland species. Architectural features were used successfully to assess the general condition and structure of willow. Tree height and DBH were identified as useful parameters to accurately assess willow age in the field. The implications of active intervention to remove willow in order to conserve the full range of communities within the hydrosere are discussed.

AB  - Not all parameters are trustworthy and practical to use as parameters to determine heat stress in dairy cattle. The temperature-humidity index (THI) is still the best, simplest and most practical index (parameter) for measurement of environmental warmth which cause heat stress in dairy cattle. It is practical, easy to determine and relatively trustworthy to use body temperature and respiratory rate as parameters to determine heat stress in dairy cattle. These physiological parameters must always be used together with THI values to determine and evaluate heat stress in dairy cattle.
   For practical purposes, plasma cortisol concentration and milk composition cannot be used as parameters to determine heat stress in dairy cattle although good indications of acute or chronic heat stress can be obtained. Vanillic acid is a break-down product of adrenalin found in milk, but before its concentration in milk can be used as an indicator/parameter of heat stress in dairy cows, more about the pharmacodynamics of adrenaline in the milk has to be known. Selection and breeding of dairy cows on the basis of their adaptibility to heat stress using the most practical heat stress parameters will ensure that their offspring will have superior performance in the prevailing environmental conditions.

AB  - As a consequence of dry conditions, coniferous trees may produce radially smaller diameter tracheids within their tree rings before regular latewood formation starts. The resulting structures, which are commonly called false rings, have demonstrated utility as an environmental indicator. However, the climatic patterns behind false rings and their potential use in climate reconstruction models have been barely explored. The study is based on 313 Austrian pines (Pinus nigra Arn.) sampled at 29 sites in the Viennese basin, an area with low annual rainfall, extended dry periods during the growing season and usually severely cold winters. False rings relate significantly to May precipitation, and in years with higher false-ring proportions, a relationships with the combination of wet April, dry May, and wet June is often seen. In linear regressions, the presence-absence of false rings was used as a "dummy" variable and, together with earlywood width, explained 31% of variation in May precipitation. Years with high false-ring proportions were found when May precipitation was less than half its long-term average. False-ring trends during the past 100 years were closely associated with changing May rainfall pattern. Overall, false rings are shown to be a useful tree-ring feature and may be applied successfully in dendroclimatic studies, i.e., in the reconstruction of very low rainfall months in early growing seasons during pre-instrumental periods.

AB  - The early and differential responses of the individual buds along a shoot have remained largely unknown due to the difficulties of analyzing early indicators that allow the monitoring of the effects of subtle changes in the environment on the growth activity of the individual bud. To overcome this problem, we transformed poplar [Populus tremula (L.) x P. alba (L.)] with two chimeric genes, Pcdc2a-gus and PcyclAt-gus, the expression of which is closely linked to cell division in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. We analyzed the expression levels of both chimeric genes in individual buds of the same tree, and under different conditions known to promote or retard growth in the buds. The expression levels of both chimeric genes were found to reflect closely the growth activity of the buds. After decapitation of the shoot, the expression of Pcdc2a-gus and PcyclAt-gus revealed rapid and selective changes in the cell cycle, even when no morphological changes were observed. Furthermore, on the basis of the expression of the chimeric cell cycle genes, different degrees of growth activity and dormancy could be discriminated in the axillary buds. In addition, the expression of PcyclAt-gus was found to be closely associated with the day length, which is critical for dormancy induction in poplar.

AB  - In northeastern Bulgaria Upper Paleozoic coals are only found in the Dobroudja Basin, This coal basin belongs to a Variscan foredeep which is at present covered by a thick (1300-1500 m) Mesozoic-Cenozoic complex (Moesian platform). The coal seams are associated with alternating sandstones, siltstones and shales deposited under fluvio-deltaic environmental conditions. Previous coalification studies on the basin have recorded high volatile to low volatile bituminous ranks. The construction of coalification profiles (increase of vitrinite reflectance with depth) in ten wells from the Dobroudja coal basin has enabled us to interpret the paleotemperature regime. The simulation of the burial and thermal history of the Upper Carboniferous formations in the Dobroudja coal basin yielded paleogeothermal gradients between 45 and 71-degrees-C/km. The results show an increase of the paleogeothermal regime from the northwest towards the southeast. The existence of a high paleo-heatflow is in accordance with data from other Carboniferous basins in Europe. Due to high vertical paleogeothermal gradients and deep burial, the maturation of the formations was completed during the Late Carboniferous. The relatively large maturation range of the Upper Carboniferous sediments enables comparison among different thermal indicators (vitrinite reflectance, spectral fluorescence maximum, pyrolysis indices, illite crystallinity and bulk clay mineralogy) and their behavior in the course of diagenesis.

AB  - In order to study the effect of polypropylene fibers on the durability of cementitious composites, several experimental tests have been carried out in the laboratory. The composite was tested with different volume fractions of polypropylene fibers (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.30% and 0.50%). All the results relating to the indicators (porosity accessible to water epsilon b, to the oxygen permeability Kapp.gas and diffusivity Dns) indicate that the addition of polypropylene fibers in a cement matrix represents only a small effect on durability. This panel of general sustainability indicators can be supplemented by indicators more specific to each degradation process identified or envisaged depending on the environmental conditions of the structure. However, for fire resistance, concrete mixes are prepared using different volume fractions of polypropylene fibers (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.30% and 0.50%), samples are heated to 300 and 600 degrees C, for exposures up to 6 hours, and tested for compressive strength. Based on the results of the study, it is concluded that the relative compressive strengths of concretes containing PP fibers were higher than those of concretes without PP fibers. In addition, it can be concluded that concrete mixes which are prepared using 0.50% PP fibers, by volume, can significantly promote residual compressive strength during heating.

AB  - Those working in Engineering for Global Development seek to improve the conditions in developing countries. A common metric for understanding the development state of a given country is the Human Development Index (HDI), which focuses on three dimensions: health, education, and income. An engineer's expertise does not always align with any of those dimensions directly, while they still hope to perform impactful work for human development. To discover other areas of expertise that are highly associated with the HDI, correlations and variable selection were performed between all World Development Indicators and the HDI. The resultant associations are presented according to industry sector for a straightforward connection to engineering expertise. The associated areas of expertise can be used during opportunity development as surrogates for focusing on the HDI dimensions themselves. The data analysis shows that work related to "Trade, Transportation, and Utilities," such as electricity distribution, and exports or imports, "Natural Resources and Mining," such as energy resources, agriculture, or access to clean water, and "Manufacturing," in general, are most commonly associated with improvements in the HDI in developing countries. Also, because the associations were discovered at country-level, they direct where geographically particular areas of expertise have been historically associated with improving HDI.

AB  - Effective wildlife management requires accurate and timely information on conservation status and trends, and knowledge of the factors driving population change. Reliable monitoring of wildlife population health, including disease, body condition, and population trends and demographics, is central to achieving this, but conventional scientific monitoring alone is often not sufficient. Combining different approaches and knowledge types can provide a more holistic understanding than conventional science alone and can bridge gaps in scientific monitoring in remote and sparsely populated areas. Inclusion of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is core to the wildlife co-management mandate of the Canadian territories and is usually included through consultation and engagement processes. We propose a status assessment framework that provides a systematic and transparent approach to including TEK, as well as local ecological knowledge (LEK), in the design, implementation, and interpretation of wildlife conservation status assessments. Drawing on a community-based monitoring program for muskoxen and caribou in northern Canada, we describe how scientific knowledge and TEK/LEK, documented through conventional monitoring, hunter-based sampling, or qualitative methods, can be brought together to inform indicators of wildlife health within our proposed assessment framework.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the combined effects of temperatures fluencies and mercury (Hg) on glutathione-dependent antioxidant system in fish, by measuring the oxidative stress indicator (LPO, lipid peroxidation) and the parameters involved in the glutathione-related antioxidant defense system (GPx, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSH, reduced glutathione), as well as the expression of related genes in grass carp,Ctenopharyngodon idella. Fish (45.37 +/- 3.58 g) were exposed to 10 test groups, e.g., 15 degrees C with/without Hg, 20 degrees C with/without Hg, 25 degrees C with/without Hg, 30 degrees C with/without Hg, 35 degrees C with/without Hg for 4 weeks. Three-way ANOVA was used to analyze the correlation between the measured parameters and experimental conditions (water temperature, Hg exposure, exposure time, and their interactions.). Our results show that there is no interaction between mercury and low temperature, but the combined effect at high temperature has been confirmed, which indicated the glutathione-dependent enzyme system in grass carp has a complex regulatory mechanism with temperature fluctuations. In the actual field monitoring, it is necessary to consider the impact of extreme temperature on the toxicity of pollutants in the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Wetlands are important centers of biodiversity. Coastal wetlands are subject to anthropogenic threats that can lead to biodiversity loss and consequent negative effects on nature conservation. We investigated relationships between wetland vegetation and habitat conditions in a coastal Nature Reserve in Northern Italy that has undergone seawater intrusion and eutrophication for several decades. The wetland vegetation in the Nature Reserve consisted of nine communities of hygrophytic and helophytic vegetation and five communities of waterplant vegetation. The hygrophytic and helophytic communities were arranged according to a salinity gradient, from salt-free habitats to strongly saline habitats. The saline habitats had high nutrient levels, due to the influx of nitrate-rich saltwater from an adjacent lagoon. The waterplant communities were all typical of freshwater habitats. Water-table depth and concentration of dissolved nutrients in the water were the main factors structuring waterplant vegetation. The main driver of future changes in the wetland vegetation of the Nature Reserve is the ongoing increase in salinity levels which may enhance expansion of halophilic species and communities, thus outcompeting locally rare freshwater species. If nutrient, especially nitrate, load further increases in the next future, this may exert negative effects on wetland species and communities preferring nutrient-poor habitats.

AB  - Exposure to blast events can cause severe trauma to vital organs such as the lungs, ears, and brain. Understanding the mechanisms behind such blast-induced injuries is of great importance considering the recent trend towards the use of explosives in modern warfare and terrorist-related incidents. To fully understand blast-induced injury, we must first be able to replicate such blast events in a controlled environment using a reproducible method. In this technique using shock tube equipment, shock waves at a range of pressures can be propagated over live cells grown in 2D, and markers of cell viability can be immediately analyzed using a redox indicator assay and the fluorescent imaging of live and dead cells. This method demonstrated that increasing the peak blast overpressure to 127 kPa can stimulate a significant drop in cell viability when compared to untreated controls. Test samples are not limited to adherent cells, but can include cell suspensions, whole-body and tissue samples, through minor modifications to the shock tube setup. Replicating the exact conditions that tissues and cells experience when exposed to a genuine blast event is difficult. Techniques such as the one presented in this article can help to define damage thresholds and identify the transcriptional and epigenetic changes within cells that arise from shock wave exposure.

AB  - A holistic assessment procedure has been used in this study for comparing conventional activated sludge (CAS) and membrane bioreactor (MBR) processes for the treatment of municipal wastewater. Technical, social, administrative, economic and environmental impacts have been evaluated based on 1 year of operational data from three full-scale lines (one MBR and two CAS) working in parallel in a large municipal treatment plant. The comparative assessment evidences a slight advantage of the conventional process in the studied case, essentially due to lower costs, complexity and energy consumption. On the other hand, the MBR technology has a better social acceptance and similar overall environmental footprint. Although these results are influenced by site-specific parameters and cannot be generalized, the assessment procedure allowed identifying the most important factors affecting the final scores for each technology and the main differences between the compared technologies. Local conditions can affect the relative importance of the assessed impacts, and the use of weighting factors is proposed for better tailoring the comparative assessment to the local needs and circumstances. A sensitivity analysis on the weighted final scores demonstrated how local factors are very important and must be carefully evaluated in the decision making process.

AB  - Adherence to medications is an important indicator of the quality of medication management and impacts on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery. Electronic healthcare data (EHD) are increasingly used to estimate adherence in research and clinical practice, yet standardization and transparency of data processing are still a concern. Comprehensive and flexible open-source algorithms can facilitate the development of high-quality, consistent, and reproducible evidence in this field. Some EHD-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) include visualization of medication histories, but this is rarely integrated in adherence analyses and not easily accessible for data exploration or implementation in new clinical settings. We introduce AdhereR, a package for the widely used open-source statistical environment R, designed to support researchers in computing EHD-based adherence estimates and in visualizing individual medication histories and adherence patterns. AdhereR implements a set of functions that are consistent with current adherence guidelines, definitions and operationalizations. We illustrate the use of AdhereR with an example dataset of 2-year records of 100 patients and describe the various analysis choices possible and how they can be adapted to different health conditions and types of medications. The package is freely available for use and its implementation facilitates the integration of medication history visualizations in open-source CDSS platforms.

AB  - The article describes the role of selenium in the humankind being. The analysis based on the published data shows that the biological synthesis is a perspective way to obtain an organic form of selenium, which can be used in dietary supplements. The ability of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus 412/307) to accumulate inorganic forms of selenium (selenites, selenates), turning them into organic forms, with purposeful trace element enrichment of culture medium is described in the article. The main organic forms of selenium, which are being used in the process of biotransformation from its inorganic forms by microorganisms, have been reorganized. The relationship between the increasing of concentrations of sodium selenite in the culture medium and the growth of biomass of lactic acid bacteria was established. It was found the depressing effect of increasing concentrations of sodium selenite on optical density rate. It was estabilished the optimal conditions for the maximum accumulation of selenium containing culture of lactic acid bacteria. The influence of selenium concentration on the lactic acid bacteria biomass accumulation was determined also by changing the values of optical density. Due to the obtained data, the selenium containing dietary supplement << Selenolakt >> was created. The main microbiological indicators that characterize the quality of the obtained product are given. The content of organic form of selenium in products reaches -195 +/- 1 mkg/g.

AB  - Swimming pools are very expensive, in terms of operation, sports facilities. Therefore, investors and managers of these facilities are looking for methods of reducing the costs of their use. One of the proposed methods is the managing of washings previously discharged to the sanitary sewage system. The assessment of possibilities for reuse of washings from swimming pool filtration system is based on the limits of basic indicators of pollutants in wastewater discharged to water and soil (temperature, pH, TSS, BOD5, COD, TN, TP, free chlorine). The conducted research of washings quality from 26 tested swimming pools have shown that washings quality is dependent on the operating conditions of the pool circuit, including the filter cycle duration and types of filter bed. A direct discharge to water or soil may be impossible due to excessive amounts of total suspended solids (above 35 mg/dm(3)) and free chlorine concentration (above 0.2 mg Cl-2/dm(3)). However, the quality of supernatant water of washings subjected to sedimentation in the laboratory shows that the washings are suitable for reuse. The installation of settling tanks in swimming pool facilities could relieve the sewage systems and allow for the discharge of supernatant water to surface waters or for the irrigation of green areas in an environmentally friendly way.

AB  - Earthworms play an essential role in providing soil fertility and may represent an important soil contamination bio-indicator. They are able to ingest soil particles, adsorb substances throughout the intestinal epithelium into the coelomic cavity, where chemicals can come in direct contact with coelomic fluid. Earthworm coelomic fluid shelters leucocytes (coelomocytes) that differ significantly both structurally and functionally. Cellular variability could lead to different susceptibility towards contaminants possibly present in soil ecosystem. In order to define population specific dose response to chemicals and to identify a homogeneous cell population to be used as a relevant biomarker, we investigated different coelomocytes subpopulation, obtained by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (5-35 %), exposed ex vivo to H2O2 in the range of concentration 15-120 mu M. DNA damage levels were assessed by the comet assay on unseparated coelomocytes and on three enriched cellular fractions (light, medium and heavy density subpopulations). All tested samples showed a dose-response genotoxic effect following H2O2 exposure. Moreover, light density sub-population appeared more susceptible to oxidative insult highlighted by a significant increase in DNA damage indexes at lower concentrations of H2O2. Present data suggested that in these experimental condition coelomocytes light fraction may represent a more sensitive biomarker of genotoxic insult.

AB  - Stormwater filters featuring traditional sand filter media cannot reliably treat indicator bacteria for stormwater harvesting. In this work, copper-modified zeolite and granular activated carbon (GAC) were prepared through Cu2+ impregnation and in situ Cu(OH)2 precipitation. Their antibacterial properties and stability in natural stormwater were studied in gravity-fed columns for 24 weeks, under typical stormwater operational conditions. 11 types of other filter media, prepared using zinc, iron, titanium and quaternary ammonium salts as antibacterial agents, were tested in parallel by way of comparison. Cu2+-immobilised zeolite and Cu(OH)(2-)coated GAC yielded an estimated 2-log reduction of E. coli within 40 min with the presence of other native microbial communities in natural stormwater. Even at high flow velocity (effective contact time of 4.5 min), both media demonstrated 0.8 log removal. Both media and Cu2+-treated GAC showed effective inactivation of the removed E. coli during dry periods. Copper leaching from Cu(OH)(2)-coated GAC was found to be below the NHMRC specified drinking water standard, while that from Cu2+-immobilised zeolite varied with the salinity in stormwater. These findings could provide useful information for further development of passive stormwater harvesting systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - INDICATOR
AB  - Human decomposition is a mosaic system with an intimate association between biotic and abiotic factors. Despite the integral role of bacteria in the decomposition process, few studies have catalogued bacterial biodiversity for terrestrial scenarios. To explore the microbiome of decomposition, two cadavers were placed at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science facility and allowed to decompose under natural conditions. The bloat stage of decomposition, a stage easily identified in taphonomy and readily attributed to microbial physiology, was targeted. Each cadaver was sampled at two time points, at the onset and end of the bloat stage, from various body sites including internal locations. Bacterial samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our data show a shift from aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria in all body sites sampled and demonstrate variation in community structure between bodies, between sample sites within a body, and between initial and end points of the bloat stage within a sample site. These data are best not viewed as points of comparison but rather additive data sets. While some species recovered are the same as those observed in culture-based studies, many are novel. Our results are preliminary and add to a larger emerging data set; a more comprehensive study is needed to further dissect the role of bacteria in human decomposition.

AB  - Biological indicators are important tools in infection control via sterilization process monitoring. The use of a standardized spore crop with a well-defined heat resistance will guarantee the quality of a biological indicator. Ambient factors during sporulation can affect spore characteristics and properties, including heat resistance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the main sporulation factors responsible for heat resistance in Geobacillus stearothermophilus, a useful biological indicator for steam sterilization. A sequence of a three-step optimization of variables (initial pH, nutrient concentration, tryptone, peptone, beef extract, yeast extract, manganese sulfate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride and potassium phosphate) was carried out to screen those that have a significant influence on heat resistance of produced spores. The variable exerting greatest influence on G. stearothermophilus heat resistance during sporulation was found to be the initial pH. Lower nutrient concentration and alkaline pH around 8.5 tended to enhance decimal reduction time at 121 A degrees C (D-121A degrees C). A central composite design enabled a fourfold enhancement in heat resistance, and the model obtained accurately describes positive pH and negative manganese sulfate concentration influence on spore heat resistance.

AB  - Despite significant conservation efforts, global biodiversity continues to decline. A key contributing factor has been a failure to fully recognise the range of ecosystem service benefits provided by biodiversity. In this paper, we use a case study relating to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in England and Wales to demonstrate the potential ecosystem service benefits that can be derived from biodiversity conservation policies. Our approach involved three stages: (1) a choice experiment to assess the economic value of ecosystem services delivered by SSSI sites; (2) a 'weighting matrix' to (a) assign ecosystem services to the different SSSI habitats and (b) identify the contribution that conservation management on SSSIs has on the delivery of these services; (3) estimation of the aggregated economic value of ecosystem services directly attributable to conservation management on SSSI sites.
   The public are willing to pay 956 pound m annually to secure the levels of services and benefits currently delivered by SSSI conservation activities, and a further 769 pound million to secure the benefits that would be delivered if SSSIs were all in favourable condition. These benefit estimates significantly exceed the annual 111 million costs of managing SSSIs, demonstrating that investing in biodiversity conservation can be cost effective. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Health risks associated with sewage-contaminated recreational waters are of important public health concern. Reliable water monitoring systems are therefore crucial. Current recreational water quality criteria rely predominantly on the enumeration of bacterial indicators, while potentially dangerous viral pathogens often remain undetected. Human enteric viruses have been proposed as alternative indicators; however, their detection is often hindered by low viral concentrations present in the environment. Reported here are novel and effective laboratory protocols for viral concentration and highly sensitive and optimized RT-PCR for the efficient detection of enteroviruses, an important enteric virus subset, in Hawaiian environmental waters. Eighteen published enterovirus primer pairs were comparatively evaluated for detection sensitivity. The primer set exhibiting the lowest detection limit under optimized conditions, EQ-1/EQ-2, was validated in a field survey of 22 recreational bodies of water located around the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Eleven sites tested positive for enterovirus, indicating fecal contamination at these locations. As an additional means of viral concentration, shellfish were collected from 9 sample sites and subjected to dissection, RNA extraction, and subsequent RT-PCR. Shellfish tissue from 6 of 9 sites tested positive for enterovirus. The techniques implemented here are valuable resources to aid accurate reflection of microbial contamination in Hawaii's environmental waters.

AB  - Impedance-based structural health monitoring (ISHM) using piezoelectric materials has been extensively developed to provide a structure health indicator. In practice, due to the environmental disturbances, the received signal in different surrounding conditions may be different from intact structure received signal. In the past, any difference was assumed being caused by damage even changes such as temperature effects on the received signal. In ISHM, the received signal is different from the intact structure received signal; however, there is not necessarily damage in the system. So, the validity of ISHM depends on the identification of environmental disturbances in order to extract the real results from disturbed results. In this article, a new method using sensor array and statistical metric analysis has been proposed to identify signal changes derived from damage and/or environmental change. Using this method, it is expected that the environmental variations affect similarly on output signals of different row sensors, whereas changes caused by damage will not be similar for all row and column sensors. This expectation is a general fact because there would be no sensible difference in the environmental variations from one side to other sides of the structure. To identify environmental disturbance from damage detection, an analysis is developed using statistical metrics. Experimental results show that this method is reliable to identify damage.

AB  - The Sinos River, in southern Brazil, is polluted by industrial discharges and untreated urban wastes. Fish genotoxicity biomarkers are valuable parameters for environmental risk assessment. In this study, we used the comet assay to detect genotoxicity due to multiple sources of pollution in the peripheral blood of a native fish species (Hyphessobrycon luetkenii). In addition, we analysed possible DNA damage from aluminum, lead, chromium, copper, nickel, iron and zinc contamination. Water samples were collected seasonally from three sampling sites and the fish were assessed under laboratory conditions. Water chemical analysis showed an increased level of aluminum and iron in most of the samples at sites 2 and 3, located in the middle and lower river course, respectively. The index of DNA damage assessed by the comet assay demonstrated no significant differences in different seasons or at the different sampling sites, while the frequency of cells with DNA damage was higher in water samples collected at sites 1 and 2 during the spring season. None of the metals studied seems to be associated with the increase in the frequency of cells with DNA damage observed during the spring season. The results of this study indicate that the Sinos River is contaminated with substances that are genotoxic to fish, including the waters near the river spring.

AB  - Ground vegetation (GV) is an important component from which many forest biodiversity indicators can be estimated. To formulate policies at European level, taking into account biodiversity, European National Forest Inventories (NFIs) are one of the most important sources of forest information. However, for monitoring GV, there are several definitions, data collection methods, and different possible indicators. Even though it must be considered that natural conditions in different countries form very different understory types, each one has its own cost-efficient monitoring design, and they can hardly be compared. Therefore, the development of general guidelines is a particularly complex issue. This paper is a review of data collection methods and consequently a selection of the best available methods for the set of indicators with an emphasis on GV sampling methodologies in NFIs. As a final result, recommendations on GV definitions and classifications, sampling methodologies, and indicators are formulated for NFIs. Different sampling areas are recommended for each life form (shrubs, herbs, etc.). Inventory cycles and sampling seasons (depending on the phonological stages) should be specially considered and evaluated in the results. The proposed indicators are based on composition at different levels of sampling intensity for each life form and on coverage measurements.

AB  - Seismic protection of buildings under risk can be achieved by increasing the knowledge about the behaviour of existing structures. Operational Modal Analysis is a powerful tool used for this purpose all over the world. It provides the dynamic characteristics of structures under operational conditions or some particular environmental issues such as blasts and earthquakes. The main objective of this study is to evaluate blast effects on a reinforced concrete (RC) building considering experimentally determined dynamic characteristics. The study consists of three phases: the measurement of vibration characteristics of blasting, the theoretical modal analysis of the inspected building, and experimental verification of dynamic characteristics using modal testing. The vibration characteristics of blasting are measured around the inspected building on hard soil using a geophone set. The initial analytical model of the building is constructed according to the in-situ investigation on building. The theoretical modal analysis results are verified by carrying out modal testing on the RC building. The Operational Modal Analysis method is used for the extraction of the dynamic characteristics of the building, and blast vibrations are taken into account as environmental vibrations. The effects of blasting on the reinforced concrete building are introduced by assessing the vibration of blasting with the dynamic characteristics of the building. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Physiological stress responses to capture may be an indicator of welfare challenges induced by animal handling. Simultaneously, blood chemistry changes induced by stress responses may confound experimental design by interacting with the biological parameters being measured. Cortisol elevation is a common indicator of stress responses in mammals and reproductive condition can profoundly influence endocrine response. We measured changes in blood cortisol and testosterone induced by handling reproductively active male Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) early and late in the breeding season. Weddell seals have the highest resting cortisol levels of all mammals yet showed a clear, prolonged elevation in cortisol in response to capture. Responses were similar when first caught and when caught a second time, later in the breeding season. Baseline testosterone levels declined over the breeding season but were not altered by capture. Administering a light dose of diazepam significantly ameliorated the cortisol response of handled animals without affecting testosterone levels. This may be an effective way of reducing acute capture stress responses. Male breeding success in years males were handled was no different to the years they were not, despite the acute capture response, suggesting no long-term impact of handling on male reproductive output.

AB  - The impact of genotype, environment, and rotation on the variability of important bioactive compounds (protein and beta-glucan) was evaluated in the grains of seven naked and two husked oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes, grown in a set of trials in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 in two Italian locations in winter seeding. Each trial was composed of two experiments, corresponding to different rotation systems, i.e., cereal or legume as the preceding crop. Genetic, agronomic, and environmental effects for all the parameters investigated and significant interactions between variability factors were found. Plots grown after cereal appeared to accumulate more protein (+4%) and beta-glucan (+9%) than those grown after legume. Significant interactions were found between rotation and genotypes. Total dietary fiber (TDF) content was also determined in a group of samples and found to be mostly determined by genotype and its interaction with other factors. Among the naked genotypes, 'Bikini' and Hja72095N showed the highest protein content; 'Abel', 'Nave', and Bikini were characterized by high beta-glucan content, and 'Konradin' had the largest amount of TDF in all environments. The present paper furnishes useful indicators to identify the most appropriate genotypes and the correct cultural practices to improve the nutritional value of naked oats, making them a suitable source of raw material for innovative food production.

AB  - This paper is a review about the application of calorimetry to study soil properties and its metabolism. Although this research has increased slowly but continuously during the last 30 years, it is true that it has received poor attention. One reason for that could be the complexity of the soil and the difficulties to investigate it from a thermodynamic point of view. In this paper we would like to demonstrate that calorimetry constitutes a very suitable method to face the main topics related to soil quality and activity. Very well known indicators used in soil research can be measured by different thermal and calorimetric methods such as differential scanning calorimetry (I)SQ, thermogravimetry (TG) and isothermal calorimetry (ITC). TG and I)SC are both temperature scanning methods used for estimation of certain properties of the soil material such as organic matter, ignition temperature, humification index, quartz content, so on, whereas the study of the soil microbial metabolism is conducted under essentially isothermal conditions by ITC. In this review, the contributions of these techniques to different topics in soil research are described and their importance for the environmental concern is discussed in the light of this new era.

AB  - For wide-area atmospheric monitoring, krypton-85 is the best indicator for clandestine plutonium separations. The detection and false alarm rates were determined from weekly samples at five different distances from the Karlsruhe reprocessing plant between 1985 and 1988. The detection rate for the separation of 4 kg of plutonium per week was found to be as high as 80-90% at a distance of less than 1 km, 70% at 5 km, 40% at 39 km, and 15% at 130 km. At distances up to 40 km, the false alarm rate is less than 3.5%. On average, the fuel released 28 TBq krypton-85 per kg plutonium. For weapons-grade plutonium, the krypton signal would be lower by a factor of 2. Hence, the given percentages correspond to the detection probabilities for the separation of a significant quantity (8 kg) of plutonium per weekly sample under the specific meteorological conditions of the WAK. The minimum separation rates that could have been detected are 2 gram of weapons-grade plutonium per week at a distance of less than I km, 40 g/week at 5 km, 200 g/week at 39 km, and 1000 g/week at 130 km.

AB  - This study quantified Escherichia coli(EC) and enterococci (ENT) in beach waters and dominant source materials, correlated these with ambient conditions, and determined selected EC genotypes and ENT phenotypes. Bathing-water ENT criteria were exceeded more frequently than EC criteria, providing conflicting interpretations of water quality. Dominant sources of EC and ENT were bird feces (10(8)/d/bird), storm drains (10(7)/d), and river water (10(11)/d); beach sands, shallow groundwater and detritus were additional sources. Beach-water EC genotypes and ENT phenotypes formed clusters with those from all source types, reflecting diffuse inputs. Some ENT isolates had phenotypes similar to those of human pathogens and/or exhibited high-level resistance to human-use antibiotics. EC and ENT concentrations were influenced by collection time and wind direction. There was a 48-72-h lag between rainfall and elevated EC concentrations at three southern shoreline beaches, but no such lag at western and eastern shoreline beaches, reflecting the influence of beach orientation with respect to cyclic (3-5 d) summer weather patterns. In addition to local contamination sources and processes, conceptual or predictive models of Great Lakes beach water quality should consider regional weather patterns, lake hydrodynamics, and the influence of monitoring method variables (time of day, frequency).

AB  - The soil quality was evaluated following the addition of organic matter and microorganisms to a clay loam soil collected in Aranjuez (Madrid) under controlled conditions of temperature and moisture, and over a period of three months. The following treatments were carried out: soil (control); soil + 50 t/ha of animal manure (E50); soil + 50 t/ha of animal manure + 301/ha of effective microorganisms (E50EM); soil + 30 t/ha of combination of various green crop residues and weeds (RC30) and soil + 30 t/ha of combination of various green crop residues and weeds + 301/ha of effective microorganisms (RC30EM). The soil samples were taken before and after the incubation and analysed using physical, chemical and microbiological parameters. A significant increase in the production of polysaccharides and alkaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes in the treatments E50EM and RC30EM was observed, being in direct correlation with the humification of the organic matter, with the water retention at field capacity, and with the cationic exchange capacity (CEC). It can be concluded that the incorporation of microorganisms EM potentialized the soil biological activity and improved physicochemical soil properties, contributing to a quick humification of fresh organic matter. Those findings were proved by microbiological activities of exopolysaccharides by alcaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes, which can be used as earlier and integral soil health indicators.

AB  - Aims: To assess the effects of soil type and time of the year on survival of the biocontrol inoculant Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 under aerobic conditions in lysimeter effluent water.
   Methods and Results: Effluent water was collected at different times from large outdoor lysimeters (2.5 m deep), which contained a well-drained or a poorly-drained cambisol, and inoculated with CHA0. The inoculant was monitored for 175 d by colony counts, total immunofluorescence cell counts and Kogure's viable cell counts. Cell numbers obtained with the three methods were similar. The inoculant declined exponentially in time and its population level varied considerably depending on the time of the year at which effluent water had been collected and soil type in the lysimeter. Positive correlations were found between the number of resident culturable aerobic bacteria and subsequent survival of the inoculant.
   Conclusions: The fluctuations of inoculant survival patterns correlated with differences in biological properties of lysimeter water that were related to soil type and time of the year.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Results suggest that predictability of the survival of bacterial soil inoculants transported to groundwater level by heavy rainfall may be improved by taking into account key biological properties of the water.

AB  - The effect of a sewage plume on the biology, optical characteristics, and particle size distributions of coastal waters was evaluated around the Sand Island, Hawaii, outfall diffuser. In situ physical and biooptical data and Niskin bottle samples were collected during a 1-week cruise from September 25 to October 1, 1994. One or two layers affected by sewage could be distinguished in the water column: recently discharged (''new'') sewage plume waters and ''old'' plume waters. In conditions characterized by high Froude number the distribution of chlorophyll fluorescence in new plume waters was the same as for ambient waters, while for low Froude number, chlorophyll fluorescence increased within the plume, demonstrating the importance of physical forcing on effluent and phytoplankton interactions. New plume waters were associated with at least 2.7-fold increases in particle load, high concentrations of particles larger than 70 mu m, increases in ammonium, phosphate, and silicate, and high levels of heterotrophic bacteria and Prochlorococcus compared to surrounding waters. Both new and old plume layers, but not phytoplankton layers, showed distinct increases in fluorescence for the excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelength pair Ex/Em = 228/340 in mm, interpreted as particulate tryptophan-like fluorescence. Such fluorescence may be useful as a new in situ real-time indicator of waters affected by effluent discharges.

AB  - Bioassay testing includes both toxicity (one or more effects is measured) and bioaccumulation (the phenomenon of tissue accumulation is measured) tests. Both types of bioassay tests have an important place in water quality assessment programmes, ideally beginning with initial screening and as part of tiered resting that includes contaminant analyses and field studies. Both have advantages (e.g. measure bioavailability, provide quantitative data, experimental manipulations can address cause-effect relationships) and disadvantages (e.g. laboratory exposures do not necessarily reflect field conditions, not all organisms can be tested). Both provide essential, but not all, information necessary for holistic water quality assessments. This paper provides a review of the use of bioassays including definitions, applications, advantages and disadvantages, utility and relevance. The utility of bioassays in monitoring programmes is illustrated by two case studies. The first case study, involving novel toxicity studies conducted in the high Arctic, illustrates the versatility of bioassays such that testing conducted in a tent on the ice resulted in new knowledge and a change in industrial discharge limits. The second case study further illustrates the importance of bioassays in decision making. In this case, a decision not to immediately spend hundreds of millions of dollars for sewage treatment, but rather to concentrate on source control, was made based in large part on bioassay testing conducted as part of an integrated environmental assessment.

AB  - Photosynthetic pigments from phytoplankton were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) along inshore-offshore transects and vertical profiles in the southeastern English Channel. An inverse relationship between the (Dd+Dt)/chl a and Dt/(Dd+Dt) ratios (Dt = diatoxanthin, Dd = diadinoxanthin, chl a = chlorophyll a) and light penetration was found, indicating a photoadaptative response of phytoplankton to high light irradiances. High ratios are present in less turbid, clearer offshore waters, in comparison to coastal waters influenced by river inputs. This response can be caused both by seasonal changes in mean irradiances or by different amounts of turbidity, which affect light penetration. The lack of variation along the vertical profiles with respect to the surface is interpreted as an indicator of a recent vertical transport of phytoplankton by the high-energy tidal currents present in the study area. In,addition, a diel cycle was noted, with a decrease in the concentrations of diatoxanthin at night. The use of this pigment as a marker of water masses must be cautious, since pigment concentration and composition are dependent on the physiological state of the cell, on the environmental conditions and dynamics, and on seasonal and diel cycles.

AB  - Active piezoelectric transducers are successfully deployed in recent years for structural health monitoring using guided elastic waves or electro-mechanical impedance (EMI). In both domains, damage detection can be hampered by operational/environmental conditions and low-power constraints. In both domains, processing can be divided into approaches (i) taking into account baselines of the pristine structure as reference, (ii) ingesting an extensive measurement history for clustering to explore anomalies, (iii) incorporating additional information to label a state. The latter approach requires data from complementary sensors, learning from laboratory/field experiments or knowledge from simulations which may be infeasible for complex structures. Semi-supervised approaches are thus gaining popularity: few initial annotations are needed, because labels emerge through clustering and are subsequently used for state classification. In our work, bending and combined bending/torsion studies on rudder stocks are considered regarding EMI-based damage detection in the presence of load. We discuss the underpinnings of our processing. Then, we follow strategy (i) by introducing frequency warping to derive an improved damage indicator (DI). Finally, in a semi-supervised manner, we develop simple rules which even in presence of varying loads need only two frequency points for reliable damage detection. This sparsity-enforcing low-complexity approach is particularly beneficial in energy-aware SHM scenarios.

AB  - Foraminifera are commonly applied as essential tools for relative time control and reconstructions of paleo/ environmental conditions. These single-celled organisms leave in the sedimentary rocks two types of fossil records represented by mineralized shells (tests) and their organic linings. Although both types require different preparation methodologies, they should be treated complementary as they represent the same specimens. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and the foraminiferal fossil record is highly biased towards mineral shells. The fossil archive of acid resistant organic linings is highly fragmentary and limited to accessory components within palynological preparations of marine sediments. Surprisingly, meta-analysis of the overall published record of linings from the Paleozoic till today indicates that nearly all foraminiferal linings reveal globular chambers that tend to show minimized distances between apertures. These two morphologic features classify them into the same Globothalamea class (sensu Pawlowski et al., 2013). The question therefore is why there is nearly no record of fossil linings belonging to other foraminiferal classes. Do all foraminiferal classes produce organic linings? Are they compositionally and structurally similar? What is their taphonomic potential? If the foraminiferal lining is phylogenetically significant, it might be involved in specific functions associated with different morphogenetic and biomineralization patterns. All these questions encourage novel interdisciplinary investigations on organic linings as a crucial research target.

AB  - The paper presents the research results of a study concerning the recognition of roof instability mechanism in the conditions of the Legnica-Glog & acute;ow Copper Belt (LGCB), in which the final mining phase encompasses roof collapse. Due to the high potential risk of this type of phenomenon to the health and safety of mine operators it was decided to launch a roof stability assessment study in order to identify timely preventive measures adequate for this hazard.
   The approach is based on taking measurements of the changes of roof angles of inclination near the sidewalls of the mine working using high-sensitivity inclinometers fixed to the end of rock anchors in the roof. In this paper, it is shown that this method works well as it captures the natural bending phenomena of the roof prior to its collapse. It is found that the observed roof bending deformation is predominantly the result of combined gravity force and in-situ horizontal stress, regardless of the presence of other factors.
   Field measurements indicate that the roof collapse is preceded by a characteristic process covering three specific phases of development: these are described in detail. A new criterion for the recognition of imminent roof destabilization was developed based on the analysis of collected field measurements.

AB  - Performance analysis and multi-objective optimization based on finite-time thermodynamics are conducted in this paper for an absorption heat pump operating between four temperature levels. The exergy-based ecological (E), the exergetic performance (EPC) and the thermo-economic (F) criteria were considered as the objective functions. The maxima of the three objective functions and the corresponding optimal conditions were obtained by applying the flowchart optimization methodology. The influences of some design factors such as the economic indicators, internal irreversibility parameters, heat-transfer coefficients of heat exchangers and the distribution ratio rate of the total heat-reject quantity between the absorber and the condenser on the maxima of the exergybased ecological (E), the exergetic performance (EPC) and the thermo-economic (F) objective functions and the corresponding optimal parameters have been analyzed and discussed. The results show that: (i) Materials with a low heat-transfer coefficient significantly affect the performance of the system. (ii) The detrimental effects of internal irreversibilities depend on the order of magnitude of the optimal heat-transfer rates in the absorber and the condenser. Finally, (iii) the optimum performance has been obtained for certain values of the heat exchange surface area and the exergy input rate from an economic point of view.

AB  - The article presents issues related to the assessment of concentrations of harmful substances in the exhaust gas cloud behind the vehicle. In the theoretical part, considerations about the harmfulness of exhaust gases and methods of detection of chemical compounds were made, and the issues of von Karman vortices and the Lambert-Beer law were referred to. The test object was a vehicle equipped with an SI engine meeting the Euro 3 standard. The drive unit had a capacity of 2.8 dm(3), a rated power reaching 142 kW at 5500 rpm and a maximum torque of 280 Nm at 3500 rpm. The measurements of the dilution of the exhaust gas cloud behind the vehicle were made in stationary conditions (laboratory) and during actual operation in the Poznan agglomeration. In the research, technically advanced equipment from the PEMS group was used. In the analysis of the obtained results, detailed considerations were made regarding the influence of the location of the measuring probe in relation to the exhaust system. As can be seen from the obtained dependencies, the vehicle motion is favorable for the assessment of concentrations behind a moving object, because the ecological indicators at successive distances behind the exhaust system achieve better parameters in most points than in a stationary test.

AB  - Emotions are part and parcel of the human condition, but their nature is debated. Three broad classes of theories about the nature of emotions can be distinguished: affect-program theories, constructionist theories, and appraisal theories. Integrating these broad classes of theories into a unifying theory is challenging. An integrative psychometric model of emotions can inform such a theory because psychometric models are intertwined with theoretical perspectives about constructs. To identify an integrative psychometric model, we delineate properties of emotions stated by emotion theories and investigate whether psychometric models account for these properties. Specifically, an integrative psychometric model of emotions should allow (a) identifying distinct emotions (central in affect-program theories), (b) between- and within-person variations of emotions (central in constructionist theories), and (c) causal relationships between emotion components (central in appraisal theories). Evidence suggests that the popular reflective and formative latent variable models-in which emotions are conceptualized as unobservable causes or consequences of emotion components-cannot account for all properties. Conversely, a psychometric network model-in which emotions are conceptualized as systems of causally interacting emotion components-accounts for all properties. The psychometric network model thus constitutes an integrative psychometric model of emotions, facilitating progress toward a unifying theory.

AB  - Construction and demolition recycling is regarded as an essential subject in the EU, as the target established by its policies to 2020 ratio is far from being achieved. The use of materials recycled fromsuchwaste has beenwidely deemed a contribution to the sustainability of the construction sector. Gypsum is one the limiting components of recycled aggregates used as a base layer in road construction. The aim of this research was to analyse the effect on mechanical properties, leaching behaviour and dimensional changes at long term in recycled aggregates with different gypsum contents. Load bearing capacity was conducted by California bearing ratio on prepared samples. Moreover, the compressive strength was conducted on samples prepared with a 3% cement addition. Both tests were studied long term. Dimensional changes were studied through swelling in California bearing ratio test mould under the modified Proctor conditions for 1 year and using an oedometer device for 5 months. Furthermore, environmental risk assessment was performed, classifying the material with gypsum addition as non-hazardous, given that sulphate anion was above the inert limit. Good mechanical behaviour in the long term and no significant dimensional changes were found regardless of gypsum content.

AB  - The Callanna Group was deposited around 800 million years ago (Ma) during an interval in Earth's history that saw a transition towards a more oxygenated atmosphere, increasing biodiversity among eukaryotic microfossils and climatic perturbations culminating in low-latitude glaciations. Previous researchers proposed that the Callanna basin was lacustrine and highly alkaline, which could provide important new insights into environmental cause-effect relationships at this time. To further interrogate these records, we examined standard bio-geochemical proxies, including organic carbon and nitrogen isotopes, iron speciation, metal abundances and carbonate-associated sulfate. Much of the primary information has been lost because the rocks of the Callanna Group have experienced extensive metamorphism up to amphibolite fades and are altered by modern weathering. However, relics of these proxies, combined with sedimentological features, preserve evidence of redox stratification within this basin. Furthermore, our observations, in particular weakly fractionated nitrogen isotopes and abundant gypsum pseudomorphs, are incompatible with the interpretation of high alkalinity. The high salt content and occurrences of tidal indicators are most parsimoniously explained by frequent incursions of seawater. Thus, the Callanna Group cannot speak straightforwardly to environmental conditions in non-marine habitats at this time. Lastly, the absence of a large carbon isotope anomaly indicates that these rocks do not correlate with the Bitter Springs Formation.

AB  - The use of materials such as paraffin is widespread in modern energy industries. The ability to absorb a large amount of energy during a phase transition at a constant temperature conditions allows to store and transport the heat. The intensity of melting is related to the thermophysical characteristics of the material and the geometric parameters of the system. Heat transfer inside the system is carried out due to the heat conduction, while in the melt the convective heat transfer intensifies the process. In this paper, a numerical study of heat transfer inside a domain filled with paraffin with nanoparticles and heated from a source of constant volumetric heat generation is performed. A two-dimensional model of the melting process has been formulated in the dimensionless variables "stream function-vorticity temperature", taking into account the natural convective heat transfer occurring in the melt. The system of partial differential equations has been solved using the finite difference method. The simulation has been carried out at different inclination angles of the considered system. Local and integral characteristics of the melting process at different heating levels of the system have been obtained. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is a rare malignancy. The tumours of the nasal cavity are thus associated with the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses. Those that start from the nasal vestibule and nasal septum raise particular problems and, although rare, form a particular group of cases among the rhinosinusal tumours. Radiation exposure, viral infections and constitutional factors were associated with the occurrence of rhinosinusal neoplasia also, but the evidence is inconclusive and indicates that only a small proportion of all squamous carcinomas can be attributed. The purpose of this study is the complex retrospective analysis of the cases of rhinosinusal malignancies diagnosed and treated in the Otolaryngology Clinic of the St. Spiridon Emergency Clinical Hospital in Iasi. We evaluated the characteristics of the patient group using a statistically significant analysis of the age, gender, background, and factors of affiliation. Specific tests and indicators have been used. It is not to be neglected the effects of the poor economic conditions and the lack of education of the population, by postponing the moment of presentation to physician, influencing the therapeutic decision, postoperative evolution. These patients often present different degrees of malnutrition, immunodepression, etc. Statistical processing showed that these patients have a twofold risk of developing rhinosinusal tumours.

AB  - One of the consequences of university degrees adaptation to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is the need to analyze and evaluate which criteria must be used in order to establish if the new learning systems do adapt to the socioeconomic and labor environment.
   The objective of this job is to analyze the indicators about the labor insertion of graduates in Industrial Relations and Human Resources degree in order to establish if the expected egress profile does match the real egress profile.
   This study was made drawing on data collected through a telephone survey among the graduates interviewed by the Axencia para a Calidade do Sistema Galego Universitario (ACSUG) (235 interviewed), on data collected in questionnaires by the Observatiorio Ocupacional da Universidade da Coruna (UDC) (288 interviewed), and through the satisfaction questionary of collected in the centers in which the degree is taught at the UDC (207 inquiries).
   The main results refer to the perception of the graduates about the training in the degree, the characteristics of access to employment and the conditions of their actual work. From these results we can conclude that the actual egress profile of graduates shows good agreement with the expected one, thus keeping it valid for academic and labor market studies.

AB  - Dual-fuel mode is a promising technique for natural gas utilization in internal combustion engines. However, for high loads operation, the engine risks to go through a hazardous knocking regime. Knock phenomenon is an abnormal combustion that can cause some disagreeable effects in engines where it occurs. It can even induce brutal irreparable engine damage under severe knocking conditions. The present paper aims first to highlight and characterize knock in dual-fuel engines fueled with natural gas as main fuel and diesel as pilot fuel. Description of this phenomenon is investigated in this type of engines. Knock behavior in dual-fuel engine is compared to spark ignition engine case. Cyclical variability of this phenomenon is studied. A new knock indicator, based on in-cylinder pressure analysis, is proposed in order to identify and evaluate knock in dual-fuel engines. In addition, knock effects on heat release, cylinder wall temperature and engine performance and emissions are examined. New techniques to delay knock appearance in this type of engines are investigated. It is found that the increase in pilot fuel quantity is an effective technique to delay knock onset in NG dual-fuel engines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Passively working devices (with no operator input) that register bat calls in real time are very important in conservation and environmental risk assessment, but data on their performance and limits under field conditions are mostly missing. We characterized the recording variability among three batcorders placed in proximate vicinity (ca. 10 m apart) to each other at 157 sites in Austria (central Europe). We found this variability perplexingly high, both for bat activity and species richness estimates. Specifically, the ratio of the highest to the lowest total sequence length (all species combined) was over fivefold in 23%, and over tenfold in 8% of the sites. In only 17% of the sites, we found the same number of species for all three devices-in most sites it varied between one and five species. The maximum call ranges of the recorded bat species affected the recording variability between the devices only for short ranges (5 m) but showed similar or relatively low variability for longer ranges. There was significantly less recording variability in sites with no woody vegetation present than in sites with open to dense vegetation structure. The results clearly indicate that the common practice of deploying only one device per site and night very likely leads to several of the resident bat species being missed and produces unreliable activity estimates.

AB  - In work dynamics of cupriferous enzymes in leaves of silver birch which is constant object of green construction in the anthropogenous environment is shown. Many researches indicate interrelation of adaptive opportunities of a vegetable organism and functioning of enzymatic system, including cupriferous enzymes of a poliphenoloxidaza and ascorbinatoxidaza. Activity of an ascorbinatoxidaza was determined by a method which is based on property of ascorbic acid to absorb light with a maximum at the wavelength of 265 nanometers. About activity of enzyme judged by reduction of size of optical density, considering that the oxidation level of ascorbic acid is proportional to amount of enzyme. Activity of a poliphenoloxidaza was determined by spectrotometric method which is based on measurement of optical density of products of reaction which are formed at oxidation of pyrocatechin for a certain period. During all vegetative period, plants in the conditions of the urban environment, had an increase in activity of a poliphenoloxidaza with achievement of the maximum value in August. In both years of observations ( 2014 and 2015) there was a decrease of the activity of an ascorbinatoxidaza in leaves during active vegetation of plants, and in the native habitat, on the contrary, its increase. The minimum values of activity of this enzyme are noted in August in the near-road plantings.

AB  - Populations show spatial-temporal fluctuations in abundance, partly due to random processes and partly due to self-regulatory processes. We evaluated the effects of various external factors on the population numerical abundance of curimba Prochilodus lineatus in the upper Parana River floodplain, Brazil, over a 19-year period. Panel data analysis was applied to examine the structure of temporal and spatial abundance while controlling auto-regressive processes and spatial non-homogeneity variances that often obscure relationships. As sources of population variation, we considered predation, competition, selected abiotic variables, construction of a dam upstream of the study area, water level and flood intensity during the spawning period. We found that biological interactions (predation and competition) were not significantly related to variations in curimba abundance; specific conductance was a space indicator of abundance, apparently linked to the biology of the species; intensity of floods determined inter-annual variation in abundances; Porto Primavera Dam negatively impacted the abundances at sites in the floodplain directly affected by discharges from the dam. Panel data analysis was a powerful tool that identified the need for intense flooding to maintain high abundances of curimba in the upper Parana River. We believe our results apply to other species with similar life strategy.

AB  - The Sandhill Fen reclamation watershed, commissioned by Syncrude Canada Ltd., is the first attempt to reclaim a self-sustaining peat-forming wetland on a previously mined area. Here, we quantified net nitrogen mineralization rates at Sandhill Fen in the first and second years since initiation (2013-2014). Our main objective was to determine whether nitrogen production potentials at Sandhill Fen were similar to six regional fens sampled across an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic peatland gradient. In the second year, net nitrogen mineralization rates across Sandhill Fen (2014 mean = 20.2 mg N.m(-2).day(-1); 0.9 mg N.kg(-1).day(-1)) were quite comparable with the benchmark fen sites (2013-2014 pooled means = 20.6 mg N.m(-2).day(-1); 5.9 mg N.kg(-1).day(-1)). However, in areas exhibiting low gravimetric soil moisture content at Sandhill Fen, net nitrification contributed more than 50% to the net N mineralization total, an uncommon observation in natural fen type wetlands. These findings highlight the importance of managing soil moisture levels during the early stages of reclamation to (1) maintain relatively anaerobic soil conditions, and (2) facilitate microbial-mediated processes to fall within an acceptable range of variation comparable to undisturbed Albertan fens.

AB  - Climate change is among the major drivers of agricultural land use change and demands autonomous farm adaptation as well as public mitigation and adaptation policies. In this article, we present an integrated land use model (ILM) mainly combining a bio-physical model and a bio-economic farm model at field, farm and landscape levels. The ILM is applied to a cropland dominated landscape in Austria to analyze impacts of climate change and mitigation and adaptation policy scenarios on farm production as well as on the abiotic environment and biotic environment. Changes in aggregated total farm gross margins from three climate change scenarios for 2040 range between + 1% and + 5% without policy intervention" and compared to a reference situation under the current climate. Changes in aggregated gross margins are even higher if adaptation policies are in place. However, increasing productivity from climate change leads to deteriorating environmental conditions such as declining plant species richness and landscape appearance. It has to be balanced by mitigation and adaptation policies taking into account effects from the considerable spatial heterogeneity such as revealed by the ILM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Drought is a major environmental factor that limits grain yield in rice. In order to understand the proteomic changes in response to drought at reproductive stage, proteins expressed in the young panicles were compared between two varieties of rice with contrasting tolernace to drought. The identified 36 differentially expressed proteins are involved in energy production, metabolism, stress defense, protein destination and cell structure. A coordinative up-regulation of triosephosphate isomerase, glycin decarboxylase complex H-protein, glyoxylase I and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase was obseved in the drought tolerant variety Zhonghan 3, which may contribute to higher tolerance by increasing the energy production and maintaining redox homeostasis. Two-dimensional Western blotting experiments identified three APX1 and three APX2 isoforms up-regulated during drought stress in drought-tolerant varieties (Zhonghan 3, IRAT109 and PRATAO). However, in drought-suceptible varieties (IR29, Zhengshan 97B and CATUNA), expression of the six isoforms was unchanged or even down-regulated. Under normal growth conditions, expression level of the six APX isoforms showed negative correlation with drought tolerance of rice. Our data suggested that APX isoforms may be considered as indicators of the redox status that related to drought tolerance in rice.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the removal of Cu2+ and Zn2+ in water by means of the adsorption process using three biosorbents derived from jatropha biomass (bark, endosperm and endosperm + seed coat). The experiments were performed in batch and evaluated the effect of solution pH, adsorbent mass, contact time, different initial concentrations of the metals Cu2+ and Zn2+, and the temperature of the solution during the adsorptive process. By kinetics, the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics the mechanisms that control the adsorptive process were evaluated. The optimal conditions for the realization of the adsorptive process for both metals were: solution pH of 5.0 and 8 g L-1 of adsorbent mass per volume of solution, with a contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate of 60 min. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption capacities for the bark, endosperm and endosperm + seed coat of Jatropha were, respectively, for Cu2+ 11.541, 20.475 and 22.910 mg g(-1), and for Zn2+ 14.852; 15.888 and 14.674 mg g(-1), with the predominance of chemisorption in monolayer. The three biosorbents derived from the biomass of Jatropha have potential for the remediation of water contaminated with Cu2+ and Zn2+.

AB  - The acute toxicity test of Cu including range-finding and definitive test, was performed on golden apple snails, Pomacea canaliculata. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of Cu at exposure times of 24, 48, 72 and 96 h were 330, 223,177 and 146 mu g/L, respectively. P. canaliculata were exposed to Cu at 146 mu g/L for 96 h to study bioaccumulation and histopathological alterations in various organs. Snails accumulated elevated levels of Cu in gill, and lesser amounts in the digestive tract, muscle, and digestive gland. Histopathological investigation revealed several alterations in the epithelia of gill, digestive tract (esophagus, intestine, rectum), and digestive gland. The most striking changes were observed in the epithelium of the gill in which there was loss of cilia, an increase in number of mucus cells, and degeneration of columnar cells. Similar changes occurred in digestive tract epithelium. The digestive gland showed moderate alterations, vacuolization and degeneration of cells and an increase in the number of basophilic cells. We concluded that, P. canaliculata has a great potential as a bioindicator for Cu, and a biomarker for monitoring Cu contamination in aquatic environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Life-cycle assessment (LCA) has been applied to many biofuel and bioenergy systems to determine potential environmental impacts, but the conclusions have varied. Different methodologies and processes for conducting LCA of biofuels make the results difficult to compare, in-turn making it difficult to make the best possible and informed decision. Of particular importance are the wide variability in country-specific conditions, modeling assumptions, data quality, chosen impact categories and indicators, scale of production, system boundaries, and co-product allocation. This study has a double purpose: conducting a critical evaluation comparing environmental LCA of biofuels from several conversion pathways and in several countries in the Pan American region using both qualitative and quantitative analyses, and making recommendations for harmonization with respect to biofuel LCA study features, such as study assumptions, inventory data, impact indicators, and reporting practices. The environmental management implications are discussed within the context of different national and international regulatory environments using a case study. The results from this study highlight LCA methodology choices that cause high variability in results and limit comparability among different studies, even among the same biofuel pathway, and recommendations are provided for improvement.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a natural antimicrobial agent (Pronat) on selected quality indicators during the shelf life of vacuum-packed frankfurters made from jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) muscle. Frankfurters with and without Pronat (0.1%) were vacuum-packed and stored at 2-4C for up to 28 days. The physicochemical parameters (water loss, pH, thiobarbituric acid value, peroxide value, moisture, texture [texture profile analysis and sharing force], folding test performance, water-holding capacity [WHC], drip loss and color) as well as the microbial counts (total aerobic and anaerobic count, total and fecal coliform) of the samples were assessed. The samples with Pronat were physicochemically stable and in good microbiological condition up to 21 days compared with the control. The main changes were attributed to color, WHC and drip loss. The Pronat concentration used in squid frankfurters greatly improved their microbiological shelf life but did not considerably improve the physicochemical quality indicators assessed in the present study.
   Practical ApplicationsAt the present time and in response to a market niche, natural and healthier foods are sought. Therefore, natural antimicrobial agent is an alternative to be used in the production of jumbo squid frankfurters, generating a healthy product with an extended shelf life.

AB  - Work-related stress is a significant occupational health concern. There have been a growing number of studies examining policy-level responses to work-related stress but most of them were from high income-countries. While welfare state characteristics are known to influence the formulation of health policy, their influences on policy responses concerning stress-related health risks at work have rarely been explored. This study compared selected indicators of social and employment-related welfare state characteristics of Taiwan with other countries. Policy level interventions undertaken in Taiwan were also reviewed. Findings show that social and employment conditions of Taiwan are characterized by low level of public social expenditure, low unionization rate, low level of collective bargaining power of workers, low female and old-age labor participation rates and substantially long working hours. Since the early 1990s, the government of Taiwan has undertaken various types of policy actions. However, most of the interventions are individual oriented and focus on tertiary level. In recent years the function of labor inspection has been strengthened but still limited in implementation capacity. While international experiences are informative, a comprehensive understanding of sociopolitical context of any given country is essential for developing effective policy actions toward work-related stress.

AB  - Little scientific information on efficiency of different commercial biofertilizers restricts setup of further reproducible pot or field experiments and hence, provides lack of evidence of biofertilizer application in plant growth promotion and disease suppression. In the present experiment, efficiency of four commercial Trichoderma and one Bacillus biofertilizer was screened by a bio-indicator plant, cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) under controlled laboratory conditions. Inoculation of cucumber seeds with different commercial biofertilizers significantly increased the germination rates (ca. 20-25%) and stimulated other growth parameters. In seedling establishment test, biofertilizers inoculated cucumber seedlings showed significant higher root dry weight (ca. 32 to 96%), leaf area (ca. 60 to 140%), root length (ca. 30%) and shoot dry weight (ca. 88%) in two weeks culture period compare to that of the control. Additionally, in-vitro antagonistic activity against take-all pathogen (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Ggt) in wheat and phosphate solubilizing activity was demonstrated for Trichoderma biofertilizer. However, in-vitro solubilization of Mn was not detected. The results suggested that the potential activity of different commercial biofertilizers could be easily screened within several days with the described rapid bio-test by increasing seed germination, and improving growth and growth related parameters of cucumber grown in nutrient solution under controlled culture system.

AB  - The Late Cretaceous fossiliferous beds of Mongolia's Gobi Desert have yielded spectacular articulated remains of a remarkable diversity of fossil mammals, lizards, turtles, birds, and non-avian dinosaurs. Paleoenvironmental interpretations of the deposits at these localities have ranged from arid wind-blown dune fields to more mesic, moist environments. Among the diversity of fossils, dinosaur eggshells and teeth are commonly found at these localities. Dinosaur eggs, like modern avian eggs, are constructed of biomineralized calcite (CaCO3) and proteins, allowing carbon and oxygen stable isotopes to be quantified to provide information about the environment in which the egg-laying animals were living. Here it is shown that dinosaur eggshell and teeth from the Djadokhta and Nemegt Formations have not been significantly altered and reflect an environment of dry dunes during deposition of the Djadokhta Formation and a more mesic stream environment for conditions in the Nemegt Formation. Carbonate nodules from the same eggshell-bearing layers also independently reflect a similar environmental signal. This study represents the first geochemical analysis of dinosaur remains from the Cretaceous of Mongolia and illustrates the potential of utilizing dinosaur fossil geochemistry of both eggs and teeth to reconstruct Mesozoic environments.

AB  - Habitat preferences of Gracilechinus acutus in the southern Bay of Biscay were studied using data from autumn bottom-trawl surveys. Wet weight and number of specimens of G. acutus were obtained and related to environmental variables ( depth, sediment type, and organic matter percentage) at each haul and to trawl fishing effort. With this information and the otter trawl effort data, the environmental requirements and the impact of the trawl fishery on G. acutus populations were analysed. Although the species was present in all depth strata and all sediment types studied, it had clear habitat preferences, as greater abundances and mean weight values were found at depths ranging from 71 to 200 m and in bottom sediments dominated by coarse and medium sands. The effect of disturbance by trawling on this echinoid was significant and clearly negative. Seabeds exposed to higher trawling disturbance showed lower values of urchin abundance and smaller urchins than areas with lower disturbance. Results of the present study confirm the initial hypothesis of the suitability of using this urchin as a bioindicator of trawling impact but only in areas with appropriate environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of attaining a wider knowledge on the essential habitat of the species.

AB  - A new type of boronate hydrogel with covalently bound dansyldiethylenetriamine as an indicator has been developed; the gel networks are based on boronate esterification of poly(vinylalcohol) with benzene-1,4-diboronic acid. In this approach, phenylboronic acid-appended N-dansyldiethylenetriamine 1 was newly synthesized to be incorporated into the gel matrix. The resulting gel film showed an absorption band at 336 nm and fluorescence at 511 nm when excited at 340 nm in water. The fluorescence measurements indicated that at neutral conditions using a HEPES buffer, the gel film was selectively quenched after immersion in an aqueous solution of Cu2+ for 30 min. The response had minimal interference from other metal ions such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Al3+, and Pb2+, which was noteworthy because dansyldiethylenetriamine alone responds to Hg2+ and Ni2+ in addition to Cu2+ in water. The reversible sensing capability was also evaluated by rinsing the film with an aqueous solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The gel was found to be a reusable and free-standing film capable of visually detecting Cu2+, providing a simple and expedient tool for on-site monitoring of Cu2+ in environmental applications such as water analysis.

AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) serves as a subalpine keystone species by regulating snowmelt runoff, reducing soil erosion, facilitating the growth of other plants, and providing food for wildlife. Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is an ideal bioindicator of climate change, because its life cycle is temperature-dependent. Western North America is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of mountain pine beetle on record, and evidence suggests that a changing climate has accelerated the life cycle of this bark beetle. This study explored the relationships between climate, mountain pine beetles, and whitebark pine mortality in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. A time series of Landsat satellite imagery (nine images) was used to monitor whitebark pine mortality in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from 1999 to 2008. The patterns of mortality were analyzed with respect to monthly climate variations over the 9-year period. The impacts of topography and autocorrelation (both spatial and temporal) were also analyzed. The most important predictor variables were autocorrelation terms, indicating a strong host-tree depletion effect. Both drier and warmer climatic conditions favored increased whitebark pine mortality. These results show for the first time a statistical link between climate variability and whitebark pine mortality, probably mediated by mountain pine beetles. FOR. SCI. 57(4):320-335.

AB  - Soil solid/liquid partition coefficients (Kd) are commonly used in quantitative environmental assessments as a means to predict retention of contaminant metals and radionuclides in soils. There are Kd data for most elements in the literature, and they can be measured for specific sites. However, there is also a need for robust, defensible relationships to predict the variation in Kd as a function of soil characteristics. This article reports relationships for As, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ho, I, La, Mn, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Np, Pa, Pb, Pu, Ra, Sb, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Tc, Th, Tl, Tm, U, W, and Yb, most based on a wide range of soil properties. Soil pH, clay content, and organic carbon content were the independent variables considered in all cases, and methodology variables were invoked for Cs, Mn, and Ni. The underlying Kd data were considered representative of steady state conditions: most were measured by desorption of the indigenous element at realistic field moisture contents. The equations, developed by forward or backward stepwise regression, were all statistically highly significant. Estimates from the equations were compared to data for seven site-specific soils and generally were within 95th percentile bounds.

AB  - This study investigates the relationships between climate changes and hillslope evolution in the Dolomites (eastern Alps, Italy), during the Late Quaternary, with particular attention paid to landslide processes. The basic premise is that modifications in landslide frequency may be interpreted as changes in the hydrological conditions of slopes, which are in turn controlled by climate.
   After the statistical analysis of a data set composed of 73 conventional radiocarbon ages, obtained from 24 landslides, four periods of enhanced landsliding have been identified: I. from 10,700 to 8400 cal BP, between Younger Dryas and the Preboreal: II. from 8200 to 6900 cal BP, during the older Atlantic; III. from 5800 to 4500 cal BP, between Atlantic and Subboreal; and IV. from 4000 to 2100 cal BP, between Subboreal and Subatlantic.
   These periods have been compared with different Lateglacial and Holocene paleoclimatic records, to check the correspondence between periods of enhanced landslide activity and cold and humid spells recognized at different spatial scales. As the records show, in the study areas, slope instability processes can be considered geomorphological indicators of climatic changes and to a certain extent reliable proxies of environmental evolution.

AB  - Pollen, macro- and micro-fossils, and sedimentologic indicators in sediment cores from Discovery Pond (DP) in south-central Alaska indicate that the coldest interval of the last deglacation was coincident with the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD), around 12.8 cal ka. The multi-proxy record from DP together with a compilation of recently published YD records from southern Alaska and the adjacent northern Pacific Ocean shows that, during the course of the YD, temperatures increased, then reached a maximum sometime around 11 cal ka. At DP, a pronounced increase in the abundance of Isoetes and Pediastrum, including species associated with oligotrophic lakes and known to respond to increased precipitation, combined with a reduction in wetland aquatics and an increase in the minerogenic component of the sediment, all indicate a shift from wetland to open-water conditions at around 12.2 cal ka. Similar to other evidence from southern Alaska, our proxy record from DP indicates an increase in temperature and effective moisture during the second half of the YD. An increase in winter precipitation might be associated with a deepening of the Aleutian low-pressure system and a northward shift in winter storm tracks, consistent with recent simulations by climate system models.

AB  - The number of relatively untouched coral reefs worldwide is rapidly decreasing. Nevertheless, one coral reef ecosystem remains relatively intact: the largest west-continental reef ecosystem in the world, Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. This study investigated the status of 2 potential bio-indicators for coral reef decline, macroalgae and sea urchin densities, on this reef. Surprisingly, both were abundant, with the presence of extensive macroalgal beds in the sandy lagoon and a sea urchin-dominated reef slope. The algal distribution on Ningaloo reflected marked cross-shelf variation in the composition of fish functional groups, with only the back reef and the reef slope exhibiting high grazing rates (completely scraped every 43 and 59 d, respectively). Estimated bioerosion rates by fishes ranged between 1 and 2.3 kg m(-2) yr(-1). Echinoids only played a significant role in bioerosion on the reef slopes owing to their high abundance in that habitat (> 12 individuals m-2). Here, estimated echinoid erosion equalled that of the most abundant excavating parrotfish, Chlorurus sordidus. High echinoid and macroalgal abundances on this relatively intact reef system highlight the need for caution when using these metrics for evaluating reef ecosystem condition.

AB  - Problem: Building assessment systems allow planners to examine whether buildings and developments meet sustainability goals, but no framework exists to help planners choose among them. Purpose: This study develops a framework for planners to use in considering which building assessment system would be most appropriate for their purposes and analyzes nine such systems. Methods: I conducted a content analysis of the system documentation for nine building assessment systems used in the United States and interviewed administrators of the systems. Results and conclusions: Although many building assessment systems appear at first to be quite similar, they have substantial differences, and could produce significantly different results when used to implement green building programs. Among the important differences are the scales at which they consider various issues, whether or not they emphasize communication, and how they prioritize and weight concerns. I also found that most national building assessment systems lack a mechanism for adapting them to local concerns and conditions. Takeaway for practice: While building assessment systems offer new tools to help communities meet sustainability goals, planners should consider the details of each system carefully before deciding on which to use in their communities. It would be very desirable for building assessment systems to become adaptable, so they will be more locally relevant and appropriate. Research support: None.

AB  - This paper traces the history of indicators and indices of child well-being from its origins in the social indicator movement of the 1970s through recent developments in the field. Initial work calling for comprehensive sets of indicators of child well-being and later recommendations for indicator improvement are detailed. Products that resulted from these recommendations, such as comprehensive indicator reports and online resources are described. The development of child well-being indices is shown to parallel the history of indicators. The contributions of state and international indicator and index projects are included as well. Important aspects of child well-being indicator development are uncovered through documenting its history, including the need to focus on subjective as well as objective measures of well-being, and the need to develop indicators for the multiple ecological contexts of children's lives, but to separate measures of context from measures of child outcomes. A rough consensus emerges across the history of indicator efforts on the critical domains of child well-being: physical, psychological, cognitive, social, and economic well-being. Recent recognition of the importance of indicators of positive development is noted.

AB  - Methane (CH4) fluxes at the sediment-water interface were studied during summer in six lakes and two reservoirs in Finland. The oxygen penetration in the sediments of these boreal mesotrophic-hypereutrophic freshwater ecosystems varied from 0 to 8 mm, and the CH4 concentrations within the uppermost 10 cm from 17 to 51000 ppm(v). The diffusive methane fluxes to the overlying water column ranged from 0.44 to 105 mg m(-1) d(-1) and correlated negatively (R-2 = 0.68) with the oxygen penetration in the sediment. This demonstrated that the CH4 concentration and the diffusive CH4 fluxes in the lake sediments are closely related to the 0 2 conditions, which regulate both CH, production and CH, oxidation in the sediment. The comparison between the diffusive CH4 fluxes at the sediment-water interface and CH4 fluxes at the water-air interface previously measured in situ in one lake and two reservoirs showed that the sediment CH4 fluxes poorly predict the CH4 release from the water surface to the atmosphere. This indicates that the CH4 oxidation in water column, advective transport of CH4 and CH4 ebullition have importance in the net CH4 release to the atmosphere. The increased CH4 concentration in water column close to the sediment is an indicator of serious oxygen depletion within sediment.

Test portions were prepared and incubated according to the conditions stated in both the BAM and ISO methods. Six food types were analyzed: frozen corn dogs, nut meats, frozen fruits, cake mix, cereal, and fresh cheese. Nut meats, frozen fruits, and fresh cheese were naturally contaminated. All other foods were artificially contaminated with either a yeast or mold. Seventeen laboratories throughout North America and Europe participated in the study. Three method comparisons were conducted. In general, there was <0.3 mean log count difference in recovery between the SimPlate method and the 2 corresponding reference methods. Moreover, mean log counts between the 2 reference methods were also very similar. The repeatability (s(r)) and reproducibility (s(R)) standard deviations were comparable between the 3 method comparisons. These results indicate that the BAM method and the SimPlate method are equivalent for enumerating yeast and mold populations in foods. Similarly, the SimPlate method is comparable to the proposed ISO method when test portions are prepared and incubated as defined in the proposed ISO method.

AB  - The effects of the commonly used processing techniques of soaking (at different pH values) and cooking on the digestive and nutritive utilization of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium from common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were studied. Before the cooking step, the beans were soaked in solutions of acid (2.6 and 5.3) or basic (8.4) pH. Chemical and biological methods were used to determine nutritional parameters in growing rats, and the fiber content of the beans was established. As the pH of the soaking solution increased, so did mineral absorption and the apparent digestibility coefficient, which reached suitable values for growing rats, due to the reduced losses of soluble minerals and the increased food intake. Metabolic utilization also improved with increased pH of the soaking solution, although the values were, in general, low as a result of urinary losses under the experimental conditions. For the experimental period of 10 days, the femur and the muscle seem to be good metabolic indicators for calcium, but not for phosphorus or magnesium. The increased amount of cellulose in the soaked seed did not have a negative effect on the digestive utilization of minerals.

AB  - Bivalves have been used in numerous environmental assessment studies, chiefly because they are sessile deposit or suspension feeding organisms found in or near sites of environmental concern, and they can be easily collected, sorted and deployed at sites of interest. Monitoring studies utilizing bivalves currently rely on the comparison of growth, survival, and contaminant bioaccumulation. Data gathered from 'reference' sites are compared with those of populations at assessment sites. These studies require extended periods of exposure, lasting weeks to months, and the use of a well defined population of test organisms of similar size, age, and condition. In many cases time and resources require researchers to restrict their sampling to the organisms on-hand at a particular site without the benefit of any reference data. Therefore more versatile and sensitive assessment methods are needed. Because effects at higher levels of organization such as growth, development, and survival are initiated at the molecular and cellular levels attempts have been made to identify useful biomarkers at these levels. The proposed advantages of molecular/cellular biomarkers are that they will respond to stress predictably and more rapidly, and will be indicative of the mechanisms of toxicity thereby yielding a rudimentary characterization of the contaminant(s) influencing them. In the following communication we will report on past and current developments in the monitoring of DNA damage as an environmental biomarker.

AB  - Livestock wastes contain many pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Following the application of these wastes to land the potential exists for environmental contamination. Plants, soil and ultimately water courses which may subsequently be used as catchments for public water supplies may all be affected. Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.

AB  - Genetic improvement of crop plants for drought resistance is hindered by lack of information on variability and associations of drought-response characters in breeding materials. We evaluated 3430 accessions in a world collection of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) for 19 characters under severe moisture-limiting field conditions at Swift Current, SK, Canada in 1984. Phenotypic diversity (H) and multicharacter associations were investigated in germplasm from nine durum wheat growing regions. The Middle East was one of the regions with a high level of diversity (H = 1.272), while Ethiopia had the lowest level of diversity (H = 1.132). The rate of excised-leaf water loss (RWL) was used as a possible indicator of drought resistance. Glaucousness, plant height, chlorotic leaf spots, days to flowering, and days to maturity were significantly associated with RWL in six to seven regions. The discrete multivariate log-linear analysis involving these six characters revealed the first order (two-character) and some second-order (three-character) associations. These five characters were chosen along with RWL as drought-response characters that may be useful for establishing selection criteria for drought resistance. These results have important implications for developing durum wheat ideotypes for high and stable production in drought-prone environments.

AB  - In Egypt, wheat is one of the most consumed cereal crops. Egypt is classified in the 12th position for wheat productivity countries globally. Two field experiments were implemented at Dar El-Ramad farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Fayoum University, Egypt, during the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 seasons. The trials investigated the effects of ridge width for planting in wide ridges 120 cm (beds) and 60 cm ridges, flat planting (basins), and three irrigation scheduling regimes based on cumulative pan evaporation, i.e. 1.0, 0.8, and 0.6 coefficients of CPE, on wheat yield (Giza 168) and its components and some crop-water relations. The purpose of this research is to explore the validation of the AquaCrop model (version 6.1) to simulate grain wheat, biological yield, and their water productivity under suggested treatments. Statistical indicators (R-2, RMSE, NRMSE, NSE, and D) were 0.96, 97.3, 1.58, 0.94, and 0.98 in the first season, respectively, and followed a similar trend in the second season. Similarly, the values of R-2, RMSE, NRMSE, NSE, and D for grain water productivity were 0.98, 0.02, 1.39, 0.98, and 0.99 in the 2015/16 season, respectively, and in the 2016/17 season were 0.99, 0.03, 2.00, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively.

AB  - To determine large scales habitat suitability for focal species, habitat models derived from one region are often extrapolated to others. However, extrapolation can be inappropriate due to regional variation of habitat selection. Accounting for the ecological mechanisms causing such variation is necessary to resolve this problem. We focused on grey-faced buzzards in agricultural landscapes of Japan, which show geographically different habitat selection. To determine whether this variation is caused by the difference in climatic conditions at geographical scales or the difference in agricultural practices at smaller regional scales, we surveyed distributions of buzzards and their major prey (frogs/orthopterans) in regions differing in rice-transplanting schedules within the same climatic zone. We found that buzzards preferred paddy-forest landscapes in the early transplanting regions, but grassland-forest landscapes in the late transplanting regions. Frogs were more abundant in the early transplanting regions due to flooded paddies, while the abundance of orthopterans did not differ. The regional variation in habitat selection of buzzards may be due to different prey availabilities caused by different agricultural schedules. We propose that habitat suitability assessments of organisms inhabiting agricultural landscapes should consider differences in production systems at regional scales and such regional partitioning is effective for accurate assessments.

AB  - Surface sediment is often used to monitor contamination and assess ecological risk. We used multiple indices to assess sediment condition and ecotoxicity caused by heavy metal(loid)s (HMs) in Zarivar International Wetland (Zarivar) of Iran. We sampled the wetland at 12 stations using a Grab sampler, during both rainy and dry seasons. Using an atomic absorption spectroscopy and a mercury analyzer, we measured As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and Hg. HMs temporal and spatial changes and general features of sediment were analyzed. Except Fe and Mn, all metals appear to have anthropogenic sources. We calculated toxic units (TUs) and contamination factors (CF) for all HMs. n-ary sumation TU calculations showed As> Cd> Cr and Ni to have the highest contributions in succession. CF indicated Cd, As, Pb and Cr, to have the highest concentrations, respectively. As (38.54 +/- 10 mg/kg (-1)) and Cd (5.75 +/- 2.01 mg/kg (-1)) exceeded their probable effect levels in 100% and 90% of the stations, respectively. Zarivar is classified as "very highly polluted" in rainy season (755.34 +/- 289.97) and "considerably polluted" in dry season (489.98 +/- 232.62) based on risk index values we calculated.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are severe, debilitating conditions with unknown etiology and are commonly misdiagnosed, when based solely on clinical interviews, because of overlapping symptoms and similar familial patterns. Until now, no valid and objective biomarkers have been used to diagnose and differentiate between psychiatric disorders. We compared clinically tested serum indicators in terms of inflammation (C-reactive protein, complement proteins C3 and C4, and serum Immunoglobulins A, M, and G), nutrients (homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12), and neurohormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol) in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ, n = 1659), bipolar disorder (BD, n = 1901), and major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 1521) to investigate potential biomarkers. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the diagnostic potential of these analytes. We found that compared with MDD, serum levels of C-reactive protein, C3, C4, and homocysteine were higher in SCZ and BD groups, and folate and vitamin B12 were lower in SCZ and BD groups. In contrast with BD, adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol increased in patients with MDD. Although ROC analysis suggested that they were not able to effectively distinguish between the three, these biological indicators showed different patterns in the three disorders. As such, more specific biomarkers should be explored in the future.

AB  - The Azores are an active volcanic region that offers exceptional conditions for nature-based tourism, one of the main axes of economic growth in the archipelago. A future volcanic eruption may have long-term consequences to this economic sector. Therefore, it is fundamental to assess its vulnerability to volcanic hazards in order to try to mitigate the associated risk. This study proposes a new approach to assessing the economic impact of explosive eruptions on the tourism sector. We considered two eruptive scenarios for Fogo volcano (Sao Miguel Island), the most probable (Volcanic Explosivity Index, VEI, 4 sub-Plinian eruption) and the worst-case (VEI 5 Plinian eruption), both producing tephra fallout and pyroclastic density currents. The results of numerical simulations were overlaid with tourism-related buildings and infrastructure of Vila Franca do Campo municipality to identify the elements at risk. The loss present value method was used to estimate the benefits generated by the accommodation units over 30 years for different economic scenarios. The assessment of the economic impact using 2018 indicators reveals that in a near-total-destruction scenario, the economic loss is approximately EUR 145 million (considering a 2 % discount rate). This approach can also be applied to other volcanic regions, geologic hazards and economic sectors.

AB  - Monitoring and predicting the microclimate in naturally ventilated barns (NVB) is important given the adverse effects of high summer temperatures on dairy cows in the context of global climate change. The aim of the work was to verify the accuracy of the microclimate forecast in a NVB using linear regression (LR). Our working hypothesis suggested that multiple periodic measurements of air temperature and relative humidity outside and inside the barns at the same time will allow us to build LR models for predicting the temperature-humidity index (THI). This was done not only for a specific dairy barn based on this indicator outside, but also in other dairy barns with a similar design, located in similar weather conditions. The results of the research indicate that the use of LR had a high accuracy of forecasting (93-96%) the THI in NVB of various designs during the summer heat. At the same time, differences were found between traits (air temperature, relative humidity as well as resulting THI) provided by meteorological weather stations and these data measured simultaneously next to the dairy barns. The proposed LR models can be used to predict THI in NVBs of different designs.

AB  - In developing countries, municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is a complex task because, in addition to economic and environmental aspects, there is also the social aspect represented by the scavenger, an informal worker in the recycling chain, who actively participates in the collection, classification and commercialization of municipal solid waste with recyclable potential (MSWRP). Grounded on an integrative bibliographical review, this study aims to longitudinally reveal the socio-productive inclusion of scavengers in Brazil, by presenting a framework indicating the practices, paradigms and future prospects for the implementation of collection programs. From the results analysed, it is verified that the National Solid Waste Policy (NSWP) has helped to increase the overall life conditions of scavengers (income generation, health, quality of life and safety at work), however it has not yet removed them from situation of risk and vulnerability, factors that still need time to evolve. In order to improve MSWM in Brazil, the main constructions found are the following: research internationalization, performance management, collection and transportation management, classification and sorting management, product commercialization management, socio-productive inclusion of scavengers, understanding about cooperativism, professional qualification, health, quality and safety at work.

AB  - Accelerated life test (ALT) has been widely used to accelerate the product reliability assessment process by testing a product at higher than nominal stress conditions. For a system with multiple components, the tests can be performed at component-level or system-level. The data at these two levels require different amount of resources to collect and carry different values of information for system reliability assessment. Even though component-level tests are cheap to perform, they cannot account for the correlations between the failure time distributions of different components. While system-level tests can naturally account for the complicated dependence between component failure time distributions, the required testing efforts are much higher than that of component-level tests. This research proposes a novel resource allocation framework for ALT-based system reliability assessment. A physics-informed load model is first employed to bridge the gap between component-level tests and system-level tests. An optimization framework is then developed to effectively allocate testing resources to different types of tests. The information fusion of component-level and system-level tests allows us to accurately estimate the system reliability with a minimized requirement on the testing resources. Results of two numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB  - A simple and cost-effective analytical device based on gas pervaporation and diffusion method for determination of ammonia is proposed. The proposed device is consisted of a well microplate as a donor chamber and a natural indicator-immobilized paper (butterfly pea flower extract) as an acceptor sensor. This allows microliter-scale solution handling. The sample preparation step involved conversion of ammonium ion to ammonia using an alkaline solution, following by gas pervaporation and then diffusion of ammonia across a PTFE membrane into a natural indicator-Immobilized paper. The colorimetric change on the paper then was detected by either a smart phone camera or naked eye for quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis, respectively. Under the optimal condition, a linear calibration with a range of 10-100 mg/L ammonium-nitrogen was obtained. The method has a detection limit (3 sigma) of 4 mg/L ammonium-nitrogen, n = 9. This proposed device was successfully applied for determination of ammonia in swine farming wastewater and chemical fertilizer samples. It could simultaneously perform triplicate run of 18 samples in 15 min (72 samples/hr). The proposed device with pervaporation and diffusion method offers on-site assay and green chemical analysis with relatively high throughput.

AB  - Wetlands in arid climates are particularly important to understand and conserve given, their low spatial extent and high rate of delivering ecosystem services. Hydromorphic soils formed in calcareous geologic materials in western Wyoming present challenges related to wetland delineation. Despite the presence of hydrophytic vegetation and wetland hydrology, these soils have not developed the traditional redoximorphic features required to identify hydric soils. To determine the limiting factor responsible for the lack of redoximorphic feature expression, a mesocosm study was conducted with cores extracted from the field. Fifteen intact soil cores were treated with Fe, organic C (OC), a combination of Fe + OC, or no amendment and inundated for 18 wk. Oxidation-reduction potential and pH were measured weekly and after 18 wk, the barrels were drained, the soil cores were dissected, and the redoximorphic features were described. The mesocosms treated with Fe and Fe + OC generated the greatest amount of redoximorphic features (21.9 and 23.0%, respectively). In contrast, the OC-treated and control mesocosms produced minimal redoximorphic features (0.16 and 0.08%, respectively). According to the results of this study, the addition of Fe and the accompanying acidifying conditions allowed for the development of redoximorphic features and therefore is responsible for their absence in situ. The field identification of carbonatic hydric soils will require the use of an alternative field indicator beyond soil morphological indicators.

AB  - Baseline variations in trout-perch energy use (growth, gonad size) and energy storage (condition, liver size) were characterized between 2009 and 2015 in 8 reaches of the Athabasca River (AB, Canada), including 2 reaches upstream of the city of Fort McMurray (AB, Canada) and 6 reaches downstream of Fort McMurray among existing oil sands operations. Generalized linear models, used to account for background variation, indicated that fork length, gonad size, and liver size decreased, whereas body weight increased, in relation to river discharge, for both male and female trout-perch. Air temperature was positively correlated with liver size and negatively correlated with gonad size and body weight for females, but only positively correlated with gonad weight for males. These linear models explained approximately 20 to 25% of the variation in adjusted body size, and upward of 80% of the variation in adjusted body weight, liver weight, and gonad weight. Residuals from linear models were used to estimate normal ranges of variation for each of the fish population performance measures. Combined, the models and normal ranges can be used to assess subsequent monitoring data, providing potential triggers for follow-up monitoring activities. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-12.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive list of key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be employed in determining the functional performance of academic and research laboratory facilities. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a two-phase approach. First, a thorough literature review was conducted to identify potential KPIs specific to the performance of laboratory facilities. This was followed by an assessment of the KPIs by 12 respondents including 6 professionals and 6 users. The KPIs were arranged in the form of a questionnaire survey containing response columns for agree/disagree, and importance rating scales for evaluation. The relative importance index values were also computed. Findings The result of the study was a comprehensive list of 161 KPIs classified into nine categories including: space, access/circulation, utilities and waste, environmental conditions, furniture, appearance/finishes/image, communications, storage within the space and special building features. These KPIs were perceived to be at varying levels of importance by the respondents. Originality/value Though previous studies developed KPIs for the performance of facilities, these KPIs are not universal. Thus, the originality of this study is in its identification of a comprehensive set of KPIs unique to the design, evaluation and management of research and academic laboratory facilities.

AB  - Cocoa bean is a rich source of polyphenols, mainly flavonoids which have a wide range of biological properties. The aim of the study was to determine the physiological indices of laboratory rats as a response to diets containing water extracts of raw or roasted cocoa beans of Forastero variety, as well as purified monomeric flavan-3-ols fraction isolated from them. The influence of these extracts on selected parameters was studied during 4 weeks feeding. The samples of rats feces were collected throughout the experiment and after its completion, biological samples (intestines content, blood, and organs) were retrieved individually from each rat and subjected to analyses. The observed changes in the gastrointestinal tract functioning indices and metabolism indicators, determined throughout the study and after its completion, confirm to some extent the biological activity of polyphenol extracts of cocoa beans. The differences in the results obtained for the analyzed parameters of the gastrointestinal tract revealed that the cocoa bean extracts differently affected the physicochemical properties of rats' intestines. The results indicate the beneficial effects of the applied nutrition treatment on the activity of cecal enzymes and the content of volatile fatty acids in the gut.

AB  - Wellbeing is the product of a complex set of factors, some of which are well perceived by individuals while others are not. Surveys based on answers to the question: 'how satisfied are you with your life?' have allowed increased understanding of the factors affecting perceived life satisfaction. We use the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to analyse the relationship between self-reported `subjective' explanatory variables and 'objective' variables that measure similar domains in explaining overall life satisfaction. We explain about 49% of the variation in individual overall life satisfaction when using 8 of the subjective satisfaction variables included in HILDA, but only about 12% when using 19 of the objective variables covering similar domains. This is partly due to the differences between objective life situations and individual's perceptions of them. Understanding the relationships between objective and subjective variables is imperative for better policy. We find that individual's perceptions of the full range of objective conditions that support their wellbeing is quite limited. An integrated understanding of wellbeing is needed that can incorporate both what individuals do perceive and value and the factors that they do not perceive well but that are nonetheless valuable in supporting their wellbeing.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising technology for treating food waste, as it has high energy recovery and controls environmental problems. The biogasification performance of food waste was observed by changing the process parameters such as hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR). A continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was operated to investigate one-phase anaerobic digestion performance of food waste due to its easy operation and lower cost for industrial application. Two operating conditions R1 (fixed HRT and loading) and R2 (varying HRT and loading concentration) were set for 116 and 92 days respectively. Results showed that the best OLR for R1 was 2.25 g.L-1 .d(-1) with the biogas yield of 787 mL.g(-1).d(-1). However, the best OLR for R2 was also 2.25 g.L-1. d(-1) with the biogas yield of 724 mL.g(-1).d(-1).

AB  - The oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and the dissolved oxygen (DO) have been monitored in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Three thousand two hundred aeration-non-aeration cycles were recorded. They were analyzed by defining 16 parameters to characterize each one of them. The vectors so obtained were treated with the box-plot tool to reject those with outliers (abnormally high or low values). The remaining data were processed by a neural network (self-organizing map: SOM) in order to classify them into classes and to obtain relations between parameters to identify those more representative of the system dynamics. They were: the oxygen uptake rate (OUR), the oxygen rise average slope (ORAS), and the oxidation-reduction potential arrow (ORParrow, the maximum distance between the ORP curve and its linearization). Finally, the classes obtained from SOM were grouped into four macro-classes by means of the K-means algorithm in order to define four operation states related to seasonal and load characteristics, which may be taken into account, along with the key parameters, in the WWTP management with the aim of improving the nutrient removal performance by adapting their controllers to seasonal and load variations.

AB  - During early stages of plant design and development chemical process route selection needs to be carried out considering factors such as inherent safety, health and environment associated with the plant along with economic aspects. These factors need to be studied by looking at the worst possible impact that can result in from a catastrophic emission and also from daily operational conditions in the plant. This paper presents a methodology that can be used to select process routes during early design stages based on inherent safety, health and environmental friendliness considering impacts due to daily plant operational activities. An integrated index called Inherent Chemical Process Route Index (ICPRI) is proposed. The ICPRI considers the potential toxicological impacts on the environment and on the occupational health and the potential chemical and process safety impacts within the plant. A lower ICPRI value indicates a more inherently environmentally friendly, inherently occupationally healthy and inherently safer process route. The ICPRI is tested on four routes to produce acetone. The propene oxidation route showed the lowest ICPRI value indicating having the lowest hazard among potential chemical process routes based on the inherent safety, health and environment assessment.

AB  - Production of genetically-modified mice is strongly dependent on environmental conditions. Mice are commonly housed at 22?, which is significantly lower than their thermoneutral zone. But, when given a choice, mice often seem to prefer higher ambient temperatures. In the current study we investigated the effect of higher ambient temperature on the production of transgenic mice, with emphasis on embryo and sperm yield and quality. Mice (C57BL/6JOlaHsd) were housed under four different ambient temperatures (22, 25, 28 and 30?). Female mice were superovulated, and mated with males. As indicators for reproductive fitness, the success of the mating was observed, including embryo yield and quality, as well as sperm count, motility and progressivity. Female mice were found to produce high amounts of high quality embryos from 22 to 28?. Sperm count dropped continuously from 22 to 30?, but sperm motility and progressivity remained high from 22 to 28?. We conclude that mice can be housed at significantly higher temperatures than is commonly recommended without compromising embryo production and quality, or sperm quality. These results could lead to fundamental changes in how mouse facilities are built and operated - especially in warmer climates whereby energy consumption and therefore costs could be significantly reduced.

AB  - In this paper, a new perspective of food packaging design is proposed by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, in which shelf life and food loss probability were taken into account. The study focused on twenty-four scenarios of packaging of a ripened cheese obtained from sheep milk, in order to analyze the environmental implications of different packaging systems in terms of potential food loss. The aim is to provide an eco-indicator able to quantify the environmental indirect effects related to the different choices in the food packaging. Results highlighted that, by considering only the direct inputs and outputs of the packaging system, thinner and recyclable packaging materials sealed in air are more sustainable from an environmental point of view. On the contrary, if indirect effects of food loss probability are also taken into account (e.g. production and transport of cheese in order to reconstruct the stockpile), multilayer systems under modified headspace conditions are preferred packaging solutions. This is consequence of the fact that cheese production brings about high environmental impacts if compared to the other phases of the life cycle, therefore, the environmental implications of the choices adopted for the packaging phase are more affected from the capacity of reducing food losses than from the production and disposing of packaging materials.

AB  - In their natural habitats, organisms are exposed to multiple stressors. Heavy metal contamination stresses the cell membrane due to increased peroxidation of lipids. Likewise, sub-zero air temperatures potentially reduce membrane functionality in ectothermal animals. We tested if acute lead (Pb) exposure for 7 days would influence survival in intertidal blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) after exposure to realistic sub-zero air temperatures. A full factorial experiment with five tissue Pb concentrations between 0 and 3500 mu g Pb/g and six sub-zero temperatures from 0 to -17 A degrees C were used to test the hypothesis that sub-lethal effects of Pb may increase the lethality caused by freezing in blue mussels exposed to temperatures simulating Greenland winter conditions. We found a significant effect of temperature on mortality. However, the short-term exposure to Pb did not result in any effects of Pb, nor did we find interactions between Pb and temperature. We analysed the relative abundance of major phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in the gill tissue, but we found no significant effect of Pb tissue concentration on PLFA composition. Results suggest that Pb accumulation has limited effects on freeze tolerance and does not induce membrane damage in terms of persistent lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Research of future climate tendencies is a precondition for appropriate climate change adaptation strategies in forestry and agriculture. The aim of this paper is to investigate the expected probability and magnitude of threatening climate conditions that are of primary importance in terms of forest management. Until 2100, precipitation and temperature results of an ensemble of 12 regional climate model simulations as well as derived indicators (e.g., Forestry Aridity Index and Ellenberg's climate quotient) have been analyzed for the A1B emission scenario. For the case study area in Southwest Hungary (Zala County), projections indicate an increasing tendency of warming and drying of summers towards the end of the 21st century. In the period 2071-2100, decrease of summer precipitation sum may exceed 25% compared to 1981-2010. Both extreme droughts and heavy precipitation events are expected to be more frequent. Consequently, the already observed climate change impacts and damages in forestry are very likely to occur with higher probability and severity. Including these results, a GIS-based "Agroclimate" decision support system is under development that contains a coherent data chain from climate change simulations, through impact assessments to adaptation support in order to provide quantified information on the possible yield potential and production risk for sustainable forest management.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an approach for an integrated evaluation of the sustainability of pig farming systems, taking into account the three classical pillars: economy, environment and society. Eight sustainability themes were considered: Animal Welfare (AW), Animal Health (AH), Breeding Programmes (BP), Environment (EN), Meat Safety (MS), Market Conformity (MC), Economy (EC) and Working Conditions (WC). A total of 37 primary indicators were identified and used for the evaluation of 15 much contrasted pig farming systems in five EU countries. The results show that the eight themes were not redundant and all contributed to the observed variation between systems. The tool was very robust for highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the systems along the eight themes that were considered. The number of primary indicators could be reduced from 37 to 18 with limited impact on the strengths/weaknesses profile of the individual systems. Integrating the eight theme evaluations into a single sustainability score is based on hypotheses or presumptions on the relative weights that should be given to the eight themes, which are very dependent on the context and on the purpose of the users of the tool. Therefore, the present paper does not have the ambition to provide a ready-for-use tool, rather to suggest an approach for the integrated evaluation of the sustainability of pig farming systems.

AB  - Sudden aspen decline (SAD), present in many parts of North America, is the sudden dieback of branches, crown loss, and rapid mortality of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We surveyed 21 plots in southwestern Colorado and categorized each plot by the mean percentage of recent crown loss (RCL) into three SAD levels: low SAD (0%-25% RCL), moderate SAD (25.1%-50% RCL), and high SAD (50.1%-100% RCL). Our research quantified the effects of SAD on microclimate and understory vegetation at the individual species and community level. Mean day surface, day subsurface, and night subsurface temperatures were warmer in high SAD stands than in low ones. High SAD stands had lower soil moisture, lower litter and duff depth, higher bare soil cover, higher photosynthetically active radiation, higher arbuscular mycorrhizal propagule densities, and higher grass biomass. Indicator plant species were uniquely associated with low and high SAD. Our study illustrates that SAD has multiple ecological effects on aspen understories, including a potential positive feedback in which warmer temperatures and decreased soil moisture, consequences of SAD, may lead to increased branch dieback and tree mortality, which would alter microclimate-making conditions more favorable to SAD and escalate the effects of SAD on understory vegetation.

AB  - In the pursuit of knowledge on the biological behavior of Brazilian Atlantic Forest tree species, this study evaluated the susceptibility of the light-demanding species, Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi., Pseudobombax grandiflorum (Cav.) A. Robyns and Joannesia princeps Vell., and of the shade-tolerant species, Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa and Lecythis pisonis Camb, to photoinhibition and acclimation capacity. These species were first cultivated under two irradiance conditions, I-20 (20% direct sunlight radiation) and I-100 (all-sky or direct sunlight) and then transferred from I-20 to I-100. The effects of the sudden increase in light radiation intensity on photosynthetic activity were then evaluated through chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence imaging, HPLC xanthophylls analysis, and cell membrane lipid peroxidation measurements. Light-demanding species were found to present a higher photochemical efficiency and higher acclimation capacity under high light irradiance than shade-tolerant species. The higher photoinhibition tolerance observed in light-demanding species was associated to their higher capacity for photochemical dissipation and dissipation of excess excitation energy via the xanthophyll cycle, leading to a lower ROS generation. The obtained results suggested that a knowledge of acclimation capacity, by means of Chl fluorescence imaging yields, is a useful indicator of species successional grouping.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the possibility of using Rinodina sophodes (Ach.) Massal., a crustose lichen as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bioaccumulator for evaluation of atmospheric pollution in tropical areas of India, where few species of lichens are able to grow. PAHs were identified, quantified and compared to evaluate the potential utility of R. sophodes. The limit of detection for different PAHs was found to be 0.008-0.050 mu g g (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). The total PAHs in different sites were ranged between 0.189 +/- 0.029 and 0.494 +/- 0.105 mu g g (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). The major sources of PAHs were combustion of organic materials, traffic and vehicular exhaust (diesel and gasoline engine). Significantly higher concentration of acenaphthylene and phenanthrene indicates road traffic as major source of PAH pollution in the city. Two-way ANOVA also confirms that all PAHs content showed significant differences between all sampling sites (P 1%). This study establishes the utility of R. sophodes in monitoring the PAHs accumulation potentiality for development of effective tool and explores the most potential traits resistant to the hazardous environmental conditions in the tropical regions of north India, where no such other effective way of biomonitoring is known so far.

AB  - Degraded areas constitute challenging tasks with respect to sustainable management of natural resources. Maintaining or even establishing certain successional stages seems to be particularly important. This paper presents a model of the succession in five different types of degraded areas in Poland based on changes in the carabid fauna. Mean Individual Biomass of Carabidae (MIB) was used as a numerical measure for the stage of succession. The run of succession differed clearly among the different types of degraded areas. Initial conditions (origin of soil and origin of vegetation) and landscape related aspects seem to be important with respect to these differences. As characteristic phases, a 'delay phase', an 'increase phase' and a 'stagnation phase' were identified. In general, the runs of succession could be described by four different parameters: (1) 'Initial degradation level', (2) 'delay', (3) 'increase rate' and (4) 'recovery level'. Applying the analytic solution of the logistic equation, characteristic values for the parameters were identified for each of the five area types. The model is of practical use, because it provides a possibility to compare the values of the parameters elaborated in different areas, to give hints for intervention and to provide prognoses about future succession in the areas. Furthermore, it is possible to transfer the model to other indicators of succession.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that morphological disparity increases while taxonomic diversity decreases in a radioactively contaminated environment, the relationship of these parameters was studied in communities (taxocenes) of rodents living in the Southern Urals in the zone of influence from the Eastern Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT) (2003-2008). Young of the year of six rodent species (98 samples) were examined in the background (control) area (0.2 Ci/km(2)) and in the impact area polluted with radionuclides from the EURT (750 Ci/km(2)). The dynamics of morphological disparity (MD), assessed with regard to average values of five exterior characters, was compared between the control and impact taxocenes. Taxonomic (taxocenotic) diversity was estimated with the Shannon index (H). Morphological disparity was found to increase significantly at low rodent abundance (in conditionally unfavorable years) and decrease at high abundance, with the value of MD in the impact taxocene being significantly higher. A negative correlation between MD and H was revealed (r = -0.70), in conformity with the above hypothesis. Discordance (difference in direction) of annual changes in the test parameters, with H increasing while MD decreases (or vice versa) was observed in unfavorable years; it can be used as an indicator of conditions unfavorable for rodent taxocenes.

AB  - A faster and simpler method to monitor the photoinactivation process of Escherichia coli involving the use of recombinant bioluminescent bacteria is described here. Escherichia coli cells were transformed with luxCDABE genes from the marine bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the recombinant bioluminescent indicator strain was used to assess, in real time, the effect of three cationic meso-substituted porphyrin derivatives on their metabolic activity, under artificial (40 W m(-2) ) and solar irradiation (approximate to 620 W m(-2)). The photoinactivation of bioluminescent E. coli is effective (> 4 log bioluminescence decrease) with the three porphyrins used, the tricationic porphyrin Tri-Py+-Me-PF being the most efficient compound. The photoinactivation process is efficient both with solar and artificial light, for the three porphyrins tested. The results show that bioluminescence analysis is an efficient and sensitive approach being, in addition, more affordable, faster, cheaper and much less laborious than conventional methods. This approach can be used as a screening method for bacterial photoinactivation studies in vitro and also for the monitoring of the efficiency of novel photosensitizer molecules. As far as we know, this is the first study involving the use of bioluminescent bacteria to monitor the antibacterial activity of porphyrins under environmental conditions.

AB  - This paper provides a set of specific examples to show the effectiveness of the trigeneration CO2 emission reduction (TCO2ER) indicator proposed in the companion paper (Part L Models and indicators) to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction from cogeneration and trigeneration systems. Specific break-even analyses are developed by introducing further indicators, with the aim of assessing the conditions for which different types of combined systems and conventional separate production systems are equivalent in terms of GHG emissions. The various emission indicators are evaluated and discussed for a number of relevant application cases concerning cogeneration and trigeneration solutions with different types of equipment. Scenario analyses are carried out to assess the possible emission reduction benefits from extended diffusion of cogeneration and trigeneration in regions characterized by different energy generation frameworks. The results strongly depend on the available technologies for combined production, on the composition of the energy generation mix, and on the trend towards upgrading the various generation systems. The numerical outcomes indicate that cogeneration and trigeneration solutions could bring significant benefits in countries with prevailing electricity production from fossil fuels, quantified by the use of the proposed indicators.

AB  - The response of the tropical South-East Atlantic Ocean to the El Ni (n) over tildeo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied for the period 1950-1999. Interaction between the ocean thermocline 'see-saw' and the overlying zonal wind circulation was examined. The two are closely linked through equatorial upwelling dynamics, with the thermocline leading during most of the period. Composite differences in climatic structure in respect of ENSO phase were analysed. Cases were selected based on indices of Pacific sea surface temperature and South-East African rainfall. Prior to an El Ni (n) over tildeo-induced drought, anomalous easterly flow over the Atlantic strengthens the cold tongue extending from Angola. How these climatic conditions affect fisheries abundance in the southern Benguela was investigated. Higher anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus catches tend to follow an El Ni (n) over tildeo event, and higher sardine Sardinops sagax catches tend to follow a La Ni (n) over tildea event, through the northward and southward shift respectively of the South Atlantic anticyclone and attendant coastal upwelling. In the southern Benguela, enhanced westerlies and warmer water favour anchovy catches over sardine catches. Recognition of the climatic patterns that impact fisheries abundance represents a potential management tool.

AB  - A quantitative genetics approach was developed to identify the genomic regions that control relative water content (RWC) in field-grown barley. The trait was previously demonstrated to be a relevant screening tool of drought-tolerance in cereals, as well as a good indicator of plant water-status. The trait was measured at the heading stage on flag leaves recorded from 167 recombinant inbred lines grown in several Mediterranean sites (Montpellier, France; Meknes, Morocco; Le Kef, Tunisia). The results obtained confirmed that several genomic regions are implicated in the total phenotypic variation of RWC. A total of nine chromosomal regions were identified. One region situated on the long arm of chromosome 6H contains the most-consistent QTL obtained in the present study. This region was previously identified as controlling RWC, as well as leaf osmotic potential under water stress and osmotic adjustment, from an experiment conducted in growth-chamber conditions with the same genetic background. The confirmation of the role of this region in the genetic control of water and turgor status underlined its interest for breeding purposes in the Mediterranean area. In addition, the presence of several dehydrin loci in the same chromosomal area reinforce its interest for genomics analyses to confirm, or not to confirm, the implication of these genes in the variation of RWC.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to estimate among- and within-population variation for juvenile growth and for growth rhythm traits, bud flushing and leaf colouring, in open-pollinated families of Quercus robur L. from six Lithuanian populations under different environmental conditions. Assessments were done in the nursery up to 4 yrs, and after replanting in three field trials at the age of 6 yrs. A highly significant population effect was found for bud flushing. Large family variance components were estimated for bud flushing and height. The familyxsite interaction was significant and more pronounced for growth cessation and height than for bud flushing. Depending on the trait, from 13 to 33% of families contributed significantly to the familyxsite interaction. Strongly significant sitexpopulation interaction was estimated only for bud flushing. Families with early bud flushing were taller, although the correlation was weak. Correlations between family means in bud flushing and bud flushing of parent trees varied from 0.53 to 0.60. Large CV A estimates for the adaptive traits suggest that species have a potential to adapt to environmental changes that may occur from global warming and indicate good perspectives for gene conservation and tree breeding when using Multiple Population Breeding System.

AB  - The effect of 25.5degreesB'e brine and 28.5degreesB'e bittern prepared from 3.5degreesB'e seawater was studied on the juvenile plants of the mangrove Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh under greenhouse conditions. The maximum in elongation growth and percentage increase in number of leaves in 5 % concentration of brine was 35.0 mm and 200 % respectively. However for 5 % bittern they were 33.0 mm and 160 % respectively. The 50 % concentrations of brine and bittern were growth inhibitory while 100 % concentration was lethal during 8 hours continuous exposure for 10 days. The highest growth of the Avicennia marina was observed when brine and bittern were diluted between 20 and 200 times. The undiluted and 50 % diluted brine and bittern were lethal and growth inhibitory, respectively. The leaves were the best indicator of the inhibitory or lethal effects on the plants. The 1 to 5 % brine promoted the growth of the leaves while other concentrations were inhibitory or lethal. However, the bittern in the range of 9 ml l(-1) and 1 to 50 % were growth inhibitory for leaves, while 100 % was lethal. The results indicate that discharge of brine and bittern in the marine environment, having semi diurnal tide cycle, will not be toxic or lethal to the plants.

Birds belonged to 4 orders, namely: Podicipediformes (Podiceps cristatus), Anseriformes (Aythya lerina, Aythya nyroca, Anas crecca), Ciconiiformes (Ardea cinerea, Ardea purpurea) and Pelecaniformes (Phalacrocorax carbo). In all cases, higher heavy metal concentrations were found in the species of gravid tapeworms, lover ones in organs (liver, muscle) of their hosts. In the tapeworms the highest values were found in Pb, the lowest in Cd. It was found different ratio values expressing the ratio of Cestoda heavy metal concentrations to host organs concentrations.
   The results indicate a different capacity of gravid tapeworms from aquatic birds to concentrate heavy metals when they are located in the intestine. The potential influence on higher heavy metal concentrations and importance of several factors such as, e.g., longer time exposure, hosts' age and their mobility, heavy metal importance for tapeworm larval stages and their intermediate hosts, heavy metal effects on tapeworm morphological and anatomical features and potential use of tapeworm heavy metal concentrations as indicators of the environment conditions are discussed.

AB  - Coeval delta(13)C Shifts recorded in buried soils at both piedmont slope and basin floor sites in the northern Chihuahuan Desert indicate a major shift from C(4) grasses to C(3) desert-scrub between 7 and 9 ka. The age assignments are based on stratigraphic correlations to charcoal dates and carbon-14 dates of carbonate. This shift is synchronous with a period of cooling in the North Atlantic that: may have triggered a period of drought in the south-western United States. Coinciding with this vegetation change, geomorphic evidence in Rio Grande, piedmont, and basin floor eolian environments indicates a major period of erosion. Subsequent gradual enrichment of pedogenic carbonate delta(13)C values in younger deposits suggests that C(4) grasses rebounded in the late Holocene (approximately 4 ka), which is consistent with other evidence of increased moisture regionally. A period of less severe aridity at approximately 2.2 ka is indicated by erosion and subsequent deposition along the alluvial fans and within the basin, and correlates with depleted pedogenic carbonate delta(13)C values suggesting a decrease in C(4) grasses. Isotope and packrat midden records should be used together to infer past environmental conditions at different elevations. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - The use of energy cost as an indicator of natural resource quality is examined. Energy cost is the direct and indirect energy used to produce a unit of a resource commodity. Different approaches to the role of energy in the economy are discussed and it is demonstrated theoretically that energy cost can give false indications of changes in resource quality. This is because energy cost is only an accurate indicator of resource quality if either energy is the single primary factor of production and the economy can be represented by an input-output model, or if there is substitutability between the factors of production, then marginal products must be proportional to the factors' embodied energy. These conditions are tested empirically using data from the US agricultural sector. The results show that there is substitutability and marginal products are not proportional to embodied energy. However, the strong neoclassical assumption of price-taking profit-maximization can be rejected at a 5% level of significance, though not at the 3.5% level. The generality of the empirical results may be restricted due to data limitations but the theoretical framework can be applied to other data sets, other resources, and even other indicators.

AB  - The microfauna of adhered biofilms treating a simulated petrochemical plant wastewater was investigated in relation to the organic loading and the toxicity. Experiments in a six-compartment laboratory rotating biological reactor were performed at organic loadings of 0.99, 1.38 and 1.97 g/l.day. The concentration of organic compounds in the artificial wastewater (phenol, acetophenone and styrene), toxicity of the wastewater, number of representative types of microfauna, their biomass and species diversity were monitored along the reactor. During this study 25 species were identified and attributed to seven classes of the three types Sarcomastigophora, Ciliophora and Nemathelminthes. Eight species from 18 ciliates have been reported in the literature as being commonly found inhabitants of aerobic wastewater treatment plants. An inverse relationship between the number of microfauna representatives and the organic loading was found. The presence of the most common species was related to the reactor operating conditions. A correlation between the toxicity of the wastewater measured by the Paramecium express-test and the distribution and abundance of microfauna was established. This express-test made it possible to predict the biological quality of the biofilm of activated sludge. Therefore, it is recommended as one of the control parameters to monitor systems of biological wastewater treatment.

AB  - The tetrazolium salt sodium 3'-{1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium}-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) was examined for use as a colorimetric indicator of viability in respiring bacteria. XTT was reduced to an orange, water-soluble formazan product by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Pseudomonas putida, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis. Formazan production was proportional to live cell biomass, and XTT was reduced by all cultures in the absence of added electron-coupling agents. XTT reduction by M. trichosporium OB3b was linear over several hours and was stimulated by the presence of an exogenous substrate (methanol). Addition of cyanide to cultures incubated under oxic conditions gave an initial 10-fold increase in XTT reduction. Viability of bacteria incubated in the absence of exogenous carbon substrates was measured as XTT reduction and compared with viability estimates from plate counts. Results obtained with the two methods were generally comparable, but the XTT assay was superior when cell recovery on plates was low. Incubation of E. coli for 7 days in the absence of exogenous carbon substrates decreased viability by 90%, whereas the corresponding decreases for cultures of M. trichosporium OB3b, P. putida, and B. subtilis were less than 40%.

AB  - The developing world is facing multidirectional challenges of socioeconomics in the era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs-2030). Fiscal indicators like fiscal imbalance and debt financing are the key hurdles in financing sustainable environment projects. This study attempted to probe the impact of the fiscal indicators on the environmental conditions of the South Asian region. For a comprehensive analysis, the study utilized a dataset of all eight countries of South Asia for 19 years. Per capita greenhouse gas emission has been used as a dependent indicator, while fiscal imbalance anddebt to gross domestic product (GDP) have been taken as independent indicators along with energy consumption, energy intensity and GDP growth rate. The generalized least squares and quantile autoregressive distributive lag methods have been adopted from econometric for this empirical analysis. Both ways confirm that fiscal imbalance and debt financing play a significant role in greenhouse gas emissions accumulation in the entire region of South Asia. Energy consumption and the cost of producing energy (energy intensity) are the other sources of greenhouse gas emissions accumulation in the area. This study suggested that developing economies of South Asia may not be able to fulfill their commitments regarding SDGs-2030 if their issues of fiscal imbalance and debt financing have not been treated initially.

AB  - Bearings are important and easily damaged parts in equipment. Collecting and analyzing the vibration signals of damaged bearings is a common fault diagnosis method. The vibration signal of the damaged bearing under constant speed conditions contains periodic pulses, and may also contain equipment operating vibration information, environmental noise or occasional pulses. In order to extract the periodic pulse information in the signal and weaken the influence of the interference signal, this paper proposes a periodic pulse detection indicator and calls it Harmonic spectral kurtosis (HSK). HSK can extract the harmonic information in the envelope spectrum, quantify the periodic pulses in the signal, and suppress the influence of interference such as random pulse. In order to expand the applications of this indicator, a tower-shaped boundary distribution diagram called Harmogram similar to Fast Kurtogram was established. Harmogram with HSK not only optimizes the spectral segmentation method, but also obtains a better center frequency and bandwidth. The filtered frequency bands can contain more periodic pulse information, and the proposed method has greater advantages in decomposing noisy signals. The simulation signal shows that the proposed method is accurate and effective. The data of bearing inner ring, outer ring and compound faults prove that the method can be applied to bearing fault diagnosis.

AB  - Hurricane Florence brought unprecedented rainfall and flooding to Eastern North Carolina in 2018. Extensive flooding had the potential to mobilize microbial contaminants from a variety of sources. Our study evaluated microbial contaminants in surface waters at 40 sites across Eastern North Carolina 1 week after the hurricane made landfall (Phase 1) and one month later (Phase 2). High concentrations of Escherichia coli were detected in flowing channel and floodwater samples across both phases; however, channel samples during Phase 2 had higher concentrations of E. coli compared to Phase 1. Human- and swine-associated fecal markers were detected in 26% and 9% of samples, respectively, with no trends related to phase of sampling. Arcobacter butzleri was previously shown to be recovered from most (73%) samples, and detection of this pathogen was not associated with any source-associated fecal marker. Detection of Listeria spp. was associated with the swine-associated fecal marker. These results suggest that improved swine and human feces management should be explored to prevent microbial contamination in surface water, especially in regions where extreme rainfall may increase due to climate change. Sampling at higher frequency surrounding rainfall events would provide more detailed characterization of the risks posed by floodwater at different time scales and under different antecedent conditions.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the differences in heavy metal accumulation in yew (Taxus baccata L.) needles depending on gender and age. Trees growing in the same soil and forest conditions were selected for the study. The study was conducted in the botanical garden in the center of Krakow, and study plots were characterized by the same deposition of pollutants. Needles of yew and soil samples were collected for laboratory analysis. Heavy metal content and basic biochemical parameters were determined in needles samples. The study confirms the importance of gender and, to a greater extent, age of needles in the accumulation of heavy metals by yews growing in an urban agglomeration. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be concluded that male yew individuals have a high tolerance to heavy metal contamination and their high needle concentration. At the same time, female individuals, which are usually less tolerant to environmental stress, seem to have some physiological mechanisms protecting them from excessive heavy metal uptake from the soil. The accumulation of heavy metals in yew needles does not negatively affect the level of their biochemical parameters.

AB  - Phytoremediation of contaminated soils relies on the ability of plants to stimulate microbial rhizosphere diversity, by releasing root exudates. This work assessed the impact of diesel contamination on soil populations of culturable bacterial groups (fast growing, N-2-fixing, phosphate (P) solubilizing, and lipolytic bacteria), and collembolans under mesocosm conditions with and without the influenceMedicago sativa. We set up six treatments sampled initially within 24 h and examined at 4, 8, and 12 months. Bacterial groups were isolated and identified with 16S rRNA sequencing, while collembolans were classified using taxonomic keys. The populations of P-solubilizing and fast-growing bacteria were stimulated after 4 months in the polluted treatments in absence ofM. sativa. On theM. sativatreatments, P-solubilizing and lipolytic bacteria increased after 8 months.StenotrophomonasandAchromobacterwere the most predominant bacterial genera. Collembolans mainly belonging to Poduromorpha and Entomobryomorpha orders, were observed in contaminated treatments on the 12th month, while in the uncontaminated control were found at the 4th month. Hydrocarbon degradation was higher than 80% in all treatments after 12 months. Diesel contamination and soil management reduced significantly the collembolan abundance; these organisms may be considered as biological indicators of soil quality and recovery after an event of diesel contamination.

AB  - Epiphytic lichens directly exposed to atmospheric conditions can help detect how diffuse but pressing global changes may impact regional forest health. For 388 plots in the U.S. Midwest region, we developed indices for climate and air quality based on variation in tree-dwelling macrolichen community compositions (NMS ordination scores), species indicator values, and species environmental optima. Three lichen indices (NMS axis 1 scores, thermophile scores, and climate centroid scores) strongly covaried with thermal and evaporative-demand variables. By contrast, three other indices (NMS axis 2 scores, nitrophile scores and nitrogen centroid scores) were correlated with NHx (reduced N) deposition. Lichen communities had contrasting responses to different forms of N (NOx vs. NHx). Overall, thermal climate variables appeared more influential than air quality in structuring regional communities, based on greater explained variation of community compositions. Richness of species and of potentially adaptive secondary metabolites declined in hot, dry, or NHx-rich sites. With continued monitoring, significant changes in lichen-community based indices could signal directional shifts in forest vegetation. Changes in the thermophile or nitrophile indices more specifically would indicate the agent and rate of change for forest-altering trends.

AB  - Northern Tajikistan creates favorable conditions for growing grapes due to its climate. The choice of method of grape production to ensure a high-quality yield, while reducing the negative effects of such production on the environment, poses a serious challenge to implementation regarding the principles of sustainable production. In addition to the essential techniques associated with grapevine production, such as irrigation, fertilization, and plant protection, a training system plays a significant role. The objective of this research was to evaluate the environmental efficiency of vineyard training systems in northern Tajikistan. The indicators accepted for the evaluation process were the vegetative growth of plants, yield, and environmental pressure of production expressed by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The single-factor experiment was conducted in Ghafurov District, and the following training systems were used: (A) multi-arm fan; (B) Umbrella Kniffin; (C) one-side multi-arm, paired planting. Growth parameters, yield, yield quality, and GHG emissions were evaluated. The cultivation of grapes in training system "C" resulted in higher values of parameters such as Practical Bud Fertility coefficient and fruiting shoots pcs and higher yields. The training systems were ranked according to GHG emissions per yield unit in the following order, from lower to higher emissions: C < B < A.

AB  - The relationship between human behaviour and vulnerability is interactive, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This paper analyses vulnerability and human behaviour in the core areas of Qilian Mountains National Park, which is located in Qilian and Sunan counties. We used the vulnerability index and grey correlation degree methods to analyse the data. The results show that from 2005 to 2017, the vulnerability degree in the Qilian Mountain area decreased gradually (Qilian County vulnerability decreased from 0.0357 to - 0.2237, and Sunan County vulnerability decreased from 0.1428 to - 0.4489). In 2017, the degree had reached its lowest value due to central and local government policy (- 0.2237 and - 0.4489). Considering that human behaviour contributed to the vulnerability degree, we find that land use and agricultural development mode, the acceleration of industrialisation and changes in the spatial patterns of human activities, and the development of urbanization and changes in resident identities are the main concepts driving the relationship between human behaviour and vulnerability. The innovative assessment indicators developed in this study can be applied to thoroughly explore the relationship between human behaviour and vulnerability and to find the influencing factors. Under certain conditions, this approach can be applied to vulnerability research in specific countries and regions.

AB  - This work presents the paleoenvironmental reconstructions from three mountainous lakes located in northern Iberia. The results from the three lakes are compared and completed with classical magnetic analyses in order to detect the influence of different processes on the record and preservation of magnetic properties. The lakes are located in the Cantabrian Mountains, Enol Lake, and in the Pyrenees, the Marbore Lake and Basa de la Mora Lake and share a similar composition of their catchment areas, dominated by limestones, although in Basa de la Mora ophites are also present. The organic matter content differs, being Enol the one with the highest organic carbon values. Redox indicator (Mn/Fe) is higher and more variable in Basa de la Mora Lake, whereas in Enol and Marbore Lakes steadily increases towards the top of the sequences. New and revisited results unravel the significance of the magnetic changes respect to the geochemical and sedimentological variations found in the geological record. Strong magnetic magnetite dominates the magnetic properties variations, with detrital and new grains formed due to diagenesis and changes in the redox conditions-more aerobic-, which alter the concentration of magnetic minerals during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The new and revisited data underlines their value as environmental and paleoclimate archives.

AB  - Pine needles are widely used as bio-indicators due to their worldwide distribution and the ease of sample collection. In contrast to deciduous trees, conifers offer the possibility of monitoring long-term exposure through older needles. Pinus halepensis Miller is a pine species native to the Mediterranean region, which has been used for restoration activities in arid and semiarid areas leading to vast spatial expansion. Needles from pine trees collected in the southeastern to northwestern extension of Croatia's coastal area at twelve sampling sites were analysed for twenty-one metals and metalloids. Statistical evaluation of the obtained data revealed significant differences for Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Se, and Sr between the different regions. Needles from trees growing on islands did not show elevated levels of Mg and/or Na as a result of the sea spray influence. The differences in metal accumulation are supposed to be linked to the environmental conditions at the respective sampling site, since the species was the same everywhere. By comparing the elemental contents of the soil those of with needles, it can be clearly seen, that the root as well as the foliar uptake contribute to the final amount.

AB  - All terrestrial plants are colonized by foliar endophytic fungi that can affect plant growth and physiology, but the prediction of these effects on the plant host remains a challenge. Here, we examined three paradigms that potentially control how endophytes affect plant hosts: habitat adaptation, evolutionary history and functional traits. We screened 35 plant-endophyte pairings in a microcosm experiment under well-watered and drought conditions with Panicum virgatum as the host. We related the measured plant responses to fungal phylogenetic relatedness, characteristics of fungal habitats across a rainfall gradient and functional traits of the fungi related to stress tolerance and resource use. The functional traits and habitat characteristics of the fungi predicted 26-53% of endophyte-mediated effects on measures of plant growth, physiology and survival. Overall, survival was higher for plants grown with more stress-tolerant fungi, and aboveground biomass was enhanced by fungi from warmer and drier habitats. Plant growth and physiology were also dependent on fungal resource use indicators; however, specific predictors were dependent on water availability. Simple ecological traits of foliar endophytic fungi observed in culture can translate to symbiotic lifestyles. These findings offer new insights and key testable predictions for likely pathways by which endophytes benefit the plant host.

AB  - The efficiency of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for disposing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been widely studied, but the environmental fates and effects of the NSAIDs and their degradation products (DPs) are poorly understood. In this study, the efficiency of ultraviolet light/Na2S2O8 (UV/PS) in degrading three NSAIDs-diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen-and the toxicity of their DPs on Cyprinus carpio (C. carpio) was investigated. Results showed that the three NSAIDs can be completely removed (removal rate > 99.9%) by UV/PS, while the mineralization rate of the NSAIDs was only 28%. When C. carpio were exposed to 0.1 mu M NSAIDs, 10 mu M persulfate (PS), and 0.1 mu M DPs of the NSAIDs for 96 h, respectively, the toxicity effects are as the NSAID DPs > PS > NSAIDs. Research results into the time-dependent effect of NSAID DPs on C. carpio demonstrated that obvious toxicity effects were observed in the first 48 hours, and the toxicity effects strengthened over time. NSAID DPs may have more severe toxicity effects than NSAIDs on C. carpio; therefore, the operating conditions of UV/PS must be optimized to eliminate the ecotoxicity of DPs.

AB  - The distribution of diatoms from surface sediments of the West Philippine Basin was analyzed, with 68 species and varieties of diatoms from 26 genera identifi ed. Diatom abundance varied spatially, with the absolute abundance of diatoms ranging from 0 to 3.4x10 4 frustules/g. The seven tropical pelagic diatoms were Alveus marinus, Azpeitia africana, Azpeitia nodulifera, Hemidiscus cuneiformis, Hemidiscus cuneiformis var. ventricos us, Roperia tesselata and Rhizosolenia bergonii. The relative abundance of these species was greater than 20%, and their distribution pattern in the sediments was overlaid by the flow of the Kuroshio Current. Ethmodiscus re x was present at 159 stations, formed the most abundant and dominant species in the diatomaceous ooze, and thus referred to as Ethmodiscus ooze. Ethmodiscus re x was also a major contributor to primary production in the region. A principal component analysis was employed to explain the relationship between samples and variations in diatom species from the WPB. Four diatom assemblages were distinguished, representing different oceanographic conditions; their spatial distributions were closely related with the North Equatorial Current and Kuroshio Current patterns in the region. These diatom assemblages can therefore be useful in deciphering late Quaternary palaeoceanographic reconstructions of the West Philippine Basin.

AB  - The current study focuses on the technical and environmental assessment of gold extraction from the solid residue obtained during the recovery of base metals from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs). In the preliminary stage, the process involves the dissolution of gold using the H2O2-HCl leaching system followed by the electrowinning of a high purity gold deposit from the obtained leaching solution. The technical performance of the process was evaluated on the basis of the efficiency factor for the H2O2 and HCl usage, current and dissolution efficiency and specific energy consumption for gold electrowinning.
   The environmental impact assessment of the process was performed based on the mass balance data corresponding to the recovery of one kg of gold in the identified optimal operating conditions. The Biwer-Heinzle method was applied to determine the values of the General Effect Indices (GEI) for the input and output streams of the process. The GEI values were found to be quite small, close to the minimum possible, thus highlighting that the developed gold recovery process is not only efficient, but has an overall low environmental impact as well.

AB  - Soil salinity, caused by natural of anthropogenic factors, has been recognized as a challenge to cultivation. Coastal saline soil is widely distributed in China. The relationships between soil properties and enzyme activities under different amendment types were investigated in Yellow River Town, Kenli County, Shandong Province. The aim of our study was to determine the appropriate treatments for alleviating salinity. Hekang (a saline soil modifier), chemical fertilizers, microbial inoculant, and organic fertilizer were applied to coastal saline soil in this study. The results showed that urease and catalase activities were improved under conditions of Hekang, organic fertilizer and microbial inoculant, but not under single chemical fertilizer applications. All the amendment applications improved alkaline phosphatase activity. Urease activity, alkaline phosphatase activity and catalase activity were all significantly positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) or soil nitrogen (N), and were negatively correlated with soil salinity or pH. In addition, Catalase activity was significantly negatively correlated with available phosphorus (P); urease activity showed a significantly positive correlation with soil available nitrogen (N) and a negative correlation with available P or available potassium (K).

AB  - Following the disastrous 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the impact of the oil spill on a variety of environments. However, it is currently unknown whether the spilled oil transported to the coastal ocean has caused any discernible perturbation to the inorganic chemistry of the water column. In this work we compared and contrasted a multiyear dataset (2006-2012) collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf, an area subject to frequent summer hypoxia. Before and after the oil spill, apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in bottom water samples all showed consistent relationship that was close to Redfield reaction stoichiometry. However, we observed a possible oil degradation signal in the bottom waters during a July 2010 cruise as manifested by a significant deviation from all other years in the relationship between AOU and DIC. Based on stable carbon isotope analysis of bottom water DIC from a July 2011 cruise in the same region, oil carbon degradation in the water column was likely negligible and the shelf water had returned to the pre-spill conditions.

AB  - It is presently unknown to what extent the endogenous direct, endogenous indirect, and exogenous indirect mechanisms contribute to bacterial photoinactivation in natural surface waters. In this study, we investigated the importance of the exogenous indirect mechanism by conducting photoinactivation experiments with eight health-relevant bacterial species (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus faecalis, Estherichia coli K12, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus bovis). We used three synthetic photosensitizers (methylene blue, rose bengal, and nitrite) and two model natural photosensitizers (Suwannee River natural organic matter and dissolved organic matter isolated from a wastewater treatment wetland) that generated singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical. B. thetaiotaomicron had larger first order rate constants than all other organisms under all conditions tested. The presence of the synthetic photosensitizers generally enhanced photoinactivation of Gram-positive facultative anaerobes (Ent. faecalis, Staph. aureus, and Strep. bovis). Among Gram-negative bacteria, only methylene blue with E. coli K12 and rose bengal with C. jejuni showed an enhancing effect. The presence of model natural photosensitizers either reduced or did not affect photoinactivation rate constants. Our findings highlight the importance of the cellular membrane and photosensitizer properties in modulating the contribution of the exogenous indirect mechanism to the overall bacterial photoinactivation.

AB  - The hematite mineralization under investigation is located 11 km NE of Sarical (Yavu) village of the Yildizeli town (Sivas Province) in central Turkey. The region is within the Central Anatolian Thrust Zone and is comprised of metamorphic units, ophiolitic rocks and overlying Tertiary volcanic and volcanosedimentary rocks in addition to Neogene terrestrial deposits. The mineralization occurs as lenticular or bedded bodies and is composed chiefly of hematite and a lesser amount of goethite. Quartz, calcite, and dolomite are the gangue minerals. Kaolinite and zeolite are the common alteration products. In this study, geochemical and mineralogical investigations were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer analysis (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEMEDX). The V/(V + Ni) ratio increases in parallel to the detritic contribution, and when this ratio is less than 0.60, deposition conditions are said to be anoxic. Considering the V/(V + Ni) ratio and Ceanom values of the studied samples, we suggest that the environment is both oxic and anoxic in character. The overall assessment of the field observations, mineral paragenesis, major, trace, and rare earth element (REE) data indicates that the Sarical hematite mineralization is of a hydrothermal-sedimentary type.

AB  - The octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) of ionic liquids (lLs) is an important indicator for its toxicity and environment impact. In this work, the K., is determined from the ratio of infinite dilution activity coefficient of IL in the water-rich and octanol-rich phases. In particular, the Pitzer-Debye-Huckel (PDH) model combined with the predictive COSMO-SAC model is used for calculating the activity coefficients. A root-mean square deviation of 0.75 is achieved for log K-ow or a factor of 4 in K-ow., for a total of 67 ILs at ambient condition. The long-range coulomb interactions (from the DH model) contribute an almost constant value of -1.35 to log K-ow, regardless of the type of IL The change of log K-ow with the molecular structure of IL is found to be dominated by the short-range attractive interactions between the IL and the solvents, including the hydrogen bonding and nonhydrogen bonding surface interactions. The combination of PDH and COSMO-SAC models provides not only the quantitative predictions of K-ow of ILs and but also physical insights to the relations between K-ow and the molecular structure of ILs.

AB  - Internationally shared, or transboundary, aquifers (TBAs) have long played an important role in sustaining drinking water supply and food production, supporting livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Rapidly growing populations and their food demands cast significant doubt on the sustainability of TBAs. Here, this study provides a first quantitative assessment of TBAs worldwide with an aquifer stress indicator over the period 1960-2010 using groundwater abstraction, groundwater recharge, and groundwater contribution to environment flow. The results reveal that 8% of TBAs worldwide are currently stressed due to human overexploitation. Over these TBAs the rate of groundwater pumping increased substantially during the past fifty years, which worsened the aquifer stress condition. In addition, many TBAs over Europe, Asia and Africa are not currently stressed, but their aquifer stress has been increasing at an alarming rate (>100%) for the past fifty years, due to the increasing reliance on groundwater abstraction for food production. Groundwater depletion is substantial over several TBAs including the India River Plain (India, Pakistan), the Paleogene and Cretaceous aquifers (the Arabian Peninsula), and a few TBAs over the USA-Mexico border. Improving irrigation efficiency can reduce the amount of groundwater depletion over some TBAs, but it likely aggravates groundwater depletion over TBAs where conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is prevalent.

AB  - This article considers public decision involving conflicting values and interests by presenting a case (Portugal, 1990s) where the construction of a dam already under way following an Environmental Impact Assessment procedure (EIA) was abandoned in order to preserve prehistoric rock engravings. The Foz Coa case illustrates the methodologies currently adopted under European Union law in the support of public decision concerning large infrastructures with significant impact on the environment and/or the cultural heritage, highlighting their limitations when confronted with the complexity and the plurality of values commonly at stake in such circumstances. We assume that the reasonableness of a public decision is meant to emerge from a process through which the various and conflicting reasons for acting are brought together, implying the opening of ends, and not only of means, to discussion and inquiry, a deliberative perspective which is put in contrast with the monistic methodologies supporting public decision-making under the EIA procedure. Some broader lessons may be drawn from the analysis of this case, we argue, regarding the conditions under which a regulatory system should tackle the diverse and conflicting values involved in public decision that affects today's highly-prized values like the environment or the cultural heritage.

AB  - In this study, the changes in UV absorbance of water samples were characterized using defined differential UV spectroscopy (DUV), a novel spectroscopic technique. Chlorination experiments were conducted with water samples from Terkos Lake (TL) and Buyukcekmece Lake (BL) (Istanbul, Turkey). The maximum loss of UV absorbance for chlorinated TL and BL raw water samples was observed at a wavelength of 272 nm. Interestingly, differential absorbance at 272 nm (Delta UV272) was shown to be a good indicator of UV absorbing chromophores and the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) resulting from chlorination. Furthermore, differential spectra of chlorinated TL waters were similar for given chlorination conditions, peaking at 272 nm. Thecorrelations between THMs and Delta UV272 were quantified by linear equations with R-2 values >0.96. The concentration of THMs formed when natural organic matter is chlorinated increases with increasing time and pH levels. Among all THMs, CHCl3 was the dominant species forming as a result of the chlorination of TL and BL raw water samples. The highest chloroform(CHCl3), dichlorobromomethane (CHCl2 Br), and dibromochloromethane (CHBr2 Cl) concentration were released per unit loss of absorbance at 272 nm at pH 9 with a maximum reaction time of 168 hours and Cl-2/dissolved organic carbon ratio of 3.2.

AB  - Knowledge, both of the historical range of spruce-dominated forests and associated site conditions, is needed by land managers to help define restoration goals and potential sites for restoration. We used an existing digital database of witness trees listed in deeds from 1752 to 1899 to compare characteristics of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) sites to non-red spruce sites to gain an understanding of historical spruce-dominated forests in West Virginia. The analysis revealed that red spruce witness trees were found at significantly higher elevations than non-spruce witness trees across the study area. However, spruce witness trees in the Western Allegheny Mountains subsection were found at significantly lower elevations than non-spruce witness trees. Indicator species analysis determined red spruce to be associated with toe slopes, benches, and valleys, although most locations were on side slopes. Across the entire study area, red spruce witness trees were more likely to be found on northeastern aspects and on acidic and frigid soils of the Mandy series. Historically, red spruce was associated with American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), birch (Betula L.), and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere). This information should be used to guide red spruce restoration efforts and shows that a range of ecological settings should be considered when setting goals and implementing active management.

AB  - Bovine cysticercosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the larval stage of Taenia Saginata, with origins in poor handling conditions and, above all, the environmental contamination caused by man, host of the adult form of the parasite. Knowing the prevalence of bovine cysticercosis is important for the implementation of control programs, however it is important to determine the source of the infection of the animals. In this paper, a study was conducted based on the records of three slaughterhouses located in the town of Colatina-ES, the addresses of properties, that sent animals to slaughtering, were obtained through the Animal Transit Guide (GTA). The properties were georeferenced for the mapping of the studied region and analysis of the distribution of cases and controls. Risk factors were studied using the information obtained in an epidemiological survey based on questionnaires application at the properties visited, being the size of the properties, the origin of animals, age of animals acquired and sewer destination, the main factors associated to the infection. The diagnosis of cysticercosis in the slaughterhouse, plus the information of the animal source, allowed defining the areas of disease occurrence and its quantification. Proving to be an important indicator for the establishment of effective programs to control the parasite.

AB  - Zooplankton were collected from Lake Taal between January and December 2008 in order to test for differences in species composition and abundance between a lake basin with intensive fish cage (FC) aquaculture and an open water area without FCs. Most species showed similar patterns of occurrence in both basins while having differences in abundance. Several rotifer species were more abundant in FC sites most of the year, while for microcrustaceans higher abundances in FC sites only happened during the first 2 months. Their distribution is attributed to the presence of higher nutrient levels in FC sites as well as wind-induced basin-wide water movements during the different monsoon seasons which disperse plankton and nutrients from FC sites to other parts of the lake. Zooplanktonic indicators, such as the Brachionus-Trichocerca quotient (Q(B/T)) and the ratio of calanoids to cladocerans and cyclopoids, clearly demonstrate the eutrophic state of the lake. A comparison with previous studies suggests that the lake was already eutrophic prior to the introduction of aquaculture in the 1970s. The trophic conditions in Lake Taal may be attributed to the lakes' tropical and volcanic nature, with productivity further enhanced by increased nutrient input from aquaculture.

AB  - Despite very favourable natural conditions, viticultural and wine production in the Republic of Croatia has not reached the expected level of development. Vineyards occupy only 2.6% of total utilised agricultural area. Relying on survey data, the authors analysed the economic success of viticultural and wine production at family farms in the Mediterranean region of Croatia, i.e. in the region of Istria. The results indicated that family farms in Istria have small viticultural and wine production, which is, basically, carried out, on average, on 0.73 ha of vineyards, producing 6.3 tons of grapes, i.e. 32.7 hl of wine. The grape and wine producing technologies are not the most modem ones, which results in the realisation of low economic effects. It is established that, by means of technological and market improvements, on the same vineyard surface area, their production income can be increased by 87%. Also, a model of viticultural and wine production was analysed on a vineyard surface area measuring 3 ha, where modern work technologies are applied and where a half of produced wine is sold in bottles. Family farms having such production would achieve 9.6 times higher income, much better indicators of productivity and cost effectiveness and one member of the family would have permanent employment.

AB  - We used the concept of growing degree-days (GDD) as a measure of the agricultural potential of climate on a regional scale in the southern part of the Russian Far East, the climate of which is characterized by thermal extremes. Daily maximum and minimum air temperatures were used to calculate GDD at 17 locations using threshold base air temperatures of 0, 5, 10 and 15 degrees C, with a high-temperature threshold cut-off of 30 degrees C. GDD increased from north to south in the study area, but the mean GDD varied considerably from one location to another. Marginal thermal conditions were observed in the north, both in the elevated areas and in the coastal regions. There was a high correlation between GDD and mean monthly temperature for the growing season from May to September (T59), such that the latter can be used as a proxy for GDD, which has implications for agricultural management. GDD and T59 had an upward trend over the 1966-2005 period for the study region as a whole. The most significant upward trend was observed for GDD0, while results for GDD15 exhibit little or no trend.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the natural history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the risk factors associated with survival. We performed a 5-year retrospective cohort study on 467 consecutive outpatients clinically diagnosed with AD and treated between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2006, at Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China. The primary endpoint in this study was survival. At baseline, we evaluated the patients' demographic characteristics and neuropsychological characteristics, comorbid conditions, neuroimaging findings, complications, and neurological signs. Among the 467 patients, 398 survived. Male gender, age, and disease severity were associated with mortality. Survival analysis using the proportional hazard model with adjustments for gender, age, and disease stage revealed that the cognition factors that predicted longer survival included high total score [hazard ratio (HR), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.76-0.96] and sub-scores in the verbal fluency test (animals, vegetables, and fruits). The presence of at least 1 complication was an independent factor predictive of a decreased lifespan (HR, 5.55; 95% CI, 1.91-16.13). In AD patients, presence of complications was an indicator of poor survival, while good performance in assessments of executive function, such as the verbal fluency test and Stroop test, at baseline was associated with longer survival.

AB  - Due to the convenient ecological conditions and Turkey's being gene center, apple has been grown almost everywhere in the country since ancient times. Because of this, determining whether the energy used in producing apple is effective or not, will be guiding for applications within the related policies. For this reason energy input and output analysis are evaluated in this study. With this analysis, apple production and the energy equivalents of the energy input used in apple production in Tokat city have been tried to find out. The data have been gathered in a survey conducted in the firms in Tokat where apples are produced intensely. In the survey following information is gathered. The highest input used in apple production belongs to the fertilizer with 36.19% among the energy equivalents used in apple production. Fuel (diesel) follows this ratio with 26.57% and electricity with 23.90%. The equivalents of the inputs of chemicals, tabour, machinery and irrigation were found less. The ratio of output/input estimated in apple production is 1.10. That means the input is effectively used in apple production. It is essential to use the resources effectively for providing the continual development. Amelioration and awareness of human resources is always a source of motivation in continual development.

AB  - Aerobic conditions in desert aquifers commonly allow high nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in recharge to persist for long periods of time, an important consideration for N-cycling and water quality. In this study, stable isotopes of NO3- (delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3)) were used to trace NO3- cycling processes which affect concentrations in groundwater and unsaturated zone moisture in the and Badain Jaran Desert in northwestern China. Most groundwater NO3- appears to be depleted relative to Cl- in rainfall concentrated by evapotranspiration, indicating net N losses. Unsaturated zone NO3- is generally higher than groundwater NO3- in terms of both concentration (up to 15 476 mu M, corresponding to 3.6 mg NO3--N per kg sediment) and ratios with Cl-. Isotopic data indicate that the NO3- derives primarily from nitrification, with a minor direct contribution of atmospheric NO3- inferred for some samples, particularly in the unsaturated zone. Localized denitrification in the saturated zone is suggested by isotopic and geochemical indicators in some areas. Anthropogenic inputs appear to be minimal, and variability is attributed to environmental factors. In comparison to other and regions, the sparseness of vegetation in the study area appears to play an important role in moderating unsaturated zone NO3- accumulation by allowing solute flushing and deterring extensive N-2 fixation.

AB  - Consumers of animal-derived foods continue to pressure suppliers of these foods on issues of food safety, environmental stewardship, and animal welfare. It is a marketing reality that consumers will not buy products that have a reasonable chance of making them ill. Food safety is paramount to marketing. Consumers do not tolerate any industry polluting the water or air. Thus, positive environmental stewardship behavior by producers is imperative to successful marketing of finished product. Compliance with all regulatory requirements' requires industry wide education and motivation.
   Maltreatment of animals of any kind is a very sensitive subject among consumers. Producers must be attentive to the living conditions of their livestock. Simply measuring production as an indicator of animal comfort will no longer satisfy consumer concern. Professional guidelines must be developed that are reasonable for all.
   The California dairy industry has created a grass-roots organization to address these three consumer issues. This program could be modified to suit any food animal industry. Remaining competitive in the food marketplace demands that the industry be responsive to consumer interests. One of the first objectives was to conduct a survey among the industry representatives to learn the state of the milk production and dairy beef operations and to focus any developing program on the real needs the industry is capable of addressing.

AB  - A multitemporal post-classification study with data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) was made to detect changes in the landscape of the Majahual coastal system, along the Mexican Pacific. Six land-use classes were used as direct indicators of the landscape condition. Mangrove, lagoon, saltmarsh, dry forest, secondary succession, and agriculture were the categories selected to evaluate the changes by comparing four thematic maps (from 1973 to 1997). The accuracy of the classification (only in the 1997 scene) was calculated from an error matrix, using the overall accuracy assessment (70%) and the Kappa coefficient (0.61). Both values indicate that the agreement in the classification was moderate, but better than one obtained by chance. The analytical comparison of data sets (1973 vs. 1986, 1986 vs. 1990, and 1990 vs. 1997) was done by using a change detection matrix and the Kappa coefficient. Agreement between data sets varied from 61% to 68%, all moderate but enough to determine the general trends of change in the system. These are mainly typified as loss of natural cover (especially dry forest) and the fragmentation of the landscape, with agricultural activities and their subsequent effects (secondary succession, modification of drainage patterns) the main transforming agents.

AB  - Aims: To characterize a bacteriocin-like factor from Bacillus licheniformis 26 L-10/3RA isolated from buffalo rumen.
   Methods and Results: The culture supernatant exhibited the antibacterial activity against a number of indicator organisms in a cut-well agar assay under anaerobic conditions. The inhibitory component was purified by following ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and confirmed to be a single peptide. A single band on tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that the peptide was purified to homogeneity and having an estimated molecular mass of approximately 1400 dalton. Complete amino acid sequence of the peptide yielded 12 amino acids from the N-terminal end (ISLEICXIFHDN). No homology with previously reported bacteriocins was observed and has been designated as Lichenin. Lichenin was found to be hydrophobic, sensitive to atmospheric oxygen, retained biological activity even after boiling for 10 min and was active over a pH range of 4.0-9.0.,
   Conclusions: The Lichenin represents the first anaerobiosis specific expression of bacteriocin-like compound isolated from Bacillus licheniformis 26 L-10/3RA of buffalo rumen origin.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Lichenin could be a potential candidate for manipulating the rumen function at molecular level intended for improving the productivity of the ruminant.

CP  - Conference on Managment of Sediments from the Source to the Sea
AB  - The Mauvoisin dam is located 1975 masl in the Alps of the Valais Canton in Switzerland. With a height of 250 m, the dam was built on a Rhone River tributary named the Dranse de Bagnes. The powerhouse is located on the river plain at 476.8 masl. The delivered power reaches 386 MW. During the last 30 years, sedimentation amounts to more than 10 million cubic meters of deposited material in the lake reservoir. Measurements indicate that the sediment layer can easily reach 20 to 40 cm in the vicinity of the service and bottom outlets.
   To preserve the storage capacity of the dam, it was decided to raise the service and bottom outlets. However, this would imply the flushing of more than 1 million of cubic meters of accumulated sediments down through the Rhone River into the Geneva Lake. An environmental impact assessment study was required to evaluate the transport condition of such quantities of suspended material and to define measures for mitigating negative effects. Even if the environmental study covered thoroughly all impacts and mitigating measures, public appraisal was negative and new solutions had to be considered.
   As for most dams, sedimentation is generally a strong threat for reservoir operation and perenniality. Unfortunately, hydro-systems are strongly affected by reservoir flushing. This opens the quest for alternative measures of sediment management.

AB  - Data from 25 sites were used to evaluate associations between macroinvertebrate assemblages on large woody debris (snags) and environmental variables in the lower San Joaquin and Sacramento River drainages in California as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water Quality Assessment Program. Samples were collected from 1993 to 1995 in the San Joaquin River drainage and in 1996 and 1997 in the Sacramento River drainage. Macroinvertebrate taxa were aggregated to the family (or higher) level of taxonomic organization, resulting in 39 taxa for analyses. Only the 31 most common taxa were used for two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). TWINSPAN analysis defined four groups of snag samples on the basis of macroinvertebrate assemblages. Analysis of variance identified differences in environmental and biotic characteristics among the groups. These results combined with the results of CCA indicated that mean dominant substrate type, gradient, specific conductance, water temperature, percentage of the basin in agricultural land use, percentage of the basin in combined agricultural and urban land uses, and elevation were important factors in explaining assemblage structure. Macroinvertebrate assemblages on snags may be useful in family level bioassessments of environmental conditions in valley floor habitats.

AB  - Industrial wastewaters that contain phenolic compounds are resistant to biodegradation and need preoxidation to improve their biodegradabilities. Preoxidation of these wastewaters by using ozone as the chemical oxidant has been found previously to be quite effective in promoting their biodegradability. In combined ozonation and biological processes, ii we want to stop ozonation at the optimum condition (i.e. the maximum biodegradability), a biodegradation test is required. Since biodegradation tests such as BOD/TOC and oxygen uptake would take a long time, we could not know the time to stop ozonation immediately. This study was undertaken to identify process parameters (pH, ORP, ozone concentration in water, ozone gas concentration at the reactor outlet) that could be useful for monitoring and real-time control purposes in ozonation processes. We want to correlate these parameters with biodegradability and intermediates formed in ozonation processes. Results showed that the rapid increase of dissolved ozone and the first plateau termination of off-gas ozone concentrations are good indicators for the depletion of p-nitrophenol, the maximum of biodegradability and the elimination of toxicity. From the mean oxidation state curve, ozonation of p-nitrophenol could be divided into three stages, and a similar pattern could also be observed in ORP profiles. From the results of this research, the application of ozone concentration and ORP profiles as real-time control parameters seems promising.

AB  - Short-range atmospheric dispersion models for environmental impact assessment usually contain meteorological preprocessors to determine boundary layer parameters based upon routine, synoptic observations. In this study, two such meteorological preprocessors are compared with field measurements from the NOPEX campaign during spring and summer at two sites in central Sweden. The two preprocessors considered are the ones used at the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and at the National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark (OML). The FMI scheme is based upon the original scheme by Holtslag and van Ulden, and the OML scheme is based on the Berkowicz and Prahm scheme. For the friction velocity, the comparisons show high correlations. However, for extremely stable atmospheric conditions, OML generates a large number of cases with near-zero friction velocities due to the roughness length dependent limiting of the Monin-Obukhov length. The sensible heat Aux and net radiation is, in general, well captured by both preprocessors. Higher values tend to be underpredicted. Especially FMI exhibits an upper cut-off behavior, since net radiation was underestimated due to a lack of hourly sunshine duration data. The Monin-Obukhov length comparisons indicate that FMI gives a slower decline for the number of near-neutral situations on the stable side than OML. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Lotus glaber Mill. is a herbaceous legume, tolerant to flooding, that in a few decades has colonised the Flooding Pampa grasslands, an extensive wetland of 90 000 km(2) in central-east Argentina. In this study, the growth and nodulation of flooded plants in 5 local populations were evaluated. Thirty-day-old seedlings, grown in pots, were flooded outdoors during 4 months. Stem, leaf, and root biomass, as well as the number of nodules per plant, were lower in flooded plants than in non-flooded ones. In flooded plants, the submerged portions of stems were hypertrophied and populations differed in the proportion of plants with adventitious roots. Flood tolerance was significantly related to the proportion of plants with adventitious roots in stems of each population. A positive relationship was shown between the proportion of plants with adventitious root and number of nodules per plant. The plants were also tolerant of low temperatures and ice-sheeting of water. These results underline the importance of morphological adaptations related to the maintenance of plant functionality under flooding conditions. The results provide evidence of the existence of characters related to flooding tolerance, which should be taken into account in ecological studies and agronomic selection programs.

AB  - A survey of primary colonization and succession of vegetation on various deposited substrates, littoral and shallow water areas of mining lakes and residual waters of the Lusatian lignite mining district is presented. Dumped substrates are characterized by a high acid potential which is caused by pyrite and marcasite of Tertiary origin. In the process of pyrite oxidation free mineral acids and large quantities of sulphate and bivalent iron are liberated. Residual waters are characterized by extreme acidity with pH values between 1.9 and 3.1 and by extremely high iron contents. Non-linear positive correlations are demonstrated between pH values and free mineral acids and between pH values and free carbonic acids (CO2) and bivalent iron. In aquatic, semi-aquatic and in terrestrial areas the succession of vegetation can be described by the following five main stages: stage of primary colonization and spontaneous vegetation; stage of monodominant species stands; stage of the formation of vegetation mosaics; stage of the formation of plant associations; final stage of succession.
   Index species of the terrestrial colonization are Corynephorus canescens and Calamogrostis epigejos, while Juncus bulbosus is the indicator species of aquatic colonization. The succession of vegetation develops in the direction of close-to-nature vegetation conditions which are typical for the heath areas of the Lusatian Lowlands.

AB  - The value of selected indicators for the assessment of faecal pollution as weil as to distinguish whether the pollution is of animal or human origin, was investigated. Faecal coliform bacteria, faecal streptococci and sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria were included as indicator organisms. Comparative tests were carried out on samples collected from a stream and river exposed to predominantly faecal pollution of domestic animal origin. Water from the same stream and river war also tested after downstream exposure to runoff from a low socio-economic informal settlement with limited sanitation. Samples were collected from perennial flow during the dry season and from storm-water runoff after thunder showers. Sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria were found to be reliable indicators of human faecal pollution. The ratio of faecal coliforms to faecal streptococci was in the order of 3.5 to 4.7 immediately after heavy exposure to faecal pollution of human origin. This ratio may distinguish between pollution of human rind animal origin under certain conditions but is not a reliable indication of pollution origin. The results show that runoff from the informal settlement constituted a major source of human faecal pollution for a river used as a downstream source of water for human consumption. It further showed that faecal pollution of human and animal origin can reliably be distinguished by means of appropriate combinations of indicators which may include sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria.

AB  - One accepted indicator of an animal's welfare is the presence or absence of stress. Few will argue with the conclusion that the welfare of an animal suffering from stress is jeopardized. For this reason, one of the most studied parameters of animal welfare has been stress. Considerable effort has been spent to determine if various management practices or conditions induce stress, resulting in the commonly held belief that any situation that results in stress should be avoided or prohibited. But, stress per se may not be bad, as it is a part of life and animals have evolved sophisticated behavioural and physiological mechanisms to deal with stress. Stress jeopardizes the animal's welfare only if the stress results in some significant biological cost to the animal that places that individual's well-being at risk. Unfortunately, classical behavioural and physiological measures of stress do not tell us if such a cost has occurred. Inter-animal variations in how animals respond to stress complicate how we assess the impact of stress on the animal and make such classical measures impractical outside of the laboratory. As a result, it appears that the most meaningful parameter of welfare that may be available is the determination of whether or not the animal has entered into a prepathological state. The challenge now is to develop the appropriate measures of such prepathological states.

AB  - The amount of leachable glutaraldehyde from medical grade Cuprophan 150PM (cellulose based) and AN69S (a copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium methallyl sulphonate) membranes, and polyproprene plates following 72 hr immersion in 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde was determined. After rinsing the materials for 30 minutes in distilled water at 37-degrees-C, the mean concentration of leachable glutaraldehyde from Cuprophan 150 PM (8.60 +/- 0.55 mug/g) was significantly greater than that from AN69S membrane (6.50 +/- 0.60 mug/g), (p < 0.01). The mean leachable glutaraldehyde from plates was 0.30 +/- 0.15 mug/g. There was a significant decrease in the mean leachable glutaraldehyde from AN69S (5.35 +/- 0.25 mug/g) after second immersion (p < 0.05). The concentration of leachable glutaraldehyde in the plates and Cuprophan 150PM remained relatively unchanged. Absence of growth following infusion of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde into blood contaminated miniature dialyzers containing high microbial loads of selected bioindicator organisms (S. aureus, P. aeruginosae, B. subtilis (Var globigii) spores, M. gordonae, A. niger spores and attenuated polio virus) demonstrated its effectiveness under environmental conditions that were conducive to high resistance. These findings indicate that 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde is readily washed from the three polymer materials that were studied and its accumulation following repeated exposure was not evident. Its application in pre-sterilization treatment of heavily contaminated invasive polymer based devices seemed feasible.

AB  - Faecal microbiota transplantation is an emerging medical concept for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. This concept, however, has disadvantages as low storability of stool and intensive donor screening. A solution to overcome these problems would be the preservation of an in vitro microbiota through freeze-drying. However, the influence of the entire preservation process, including cultivation and lyophilization, has not been assessed so far. In this study, the influences of the process steps cultivation, drying and re-cultivation were determined with cell count, production of metabolites, microbial composition and diversity in the system as evaluation criteria. All pH conditions resulted in stable, culturable communities after re-cultivation. Cell count, richness, diversity and microbial composition were affected by freeze-drying, but these effects were reversible and vanished during re-cultivation. Hence, the re-cultivated system did not differ from the system before drying. The metabolism, measured by short-chain fatty acids as indicators, showed slight changes due to natural dynamics. Consequently, the cultivation prior to drying was identified to have more influence than the drying itself on the preservation process and therefore the biggest potential for optimization. Hence, the highest similarity with the initial stool sample was obtained with pH 6.0 - 6.5 during cultivation.

AB  - Community-based monitoring programs (CBMPs) are a cost-effective option to collect the long-term data required to effectively monitor estuaries. Data quality concerns have caused some CBMP datasets, which could fill knowledge gaps for aquatic ecosystems, to go unused. The Community Aquatic Monitoring Program (CAMP) is a CBMP that has collected littoral nekton assemblage data from estuaries in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence since 2003. Concerns with the CAMP sampling design (station placement and numbers) have prevented decision-makers from using the data to inform estuary health assessments. This study tested if CAMP's sampling design that accommodates volunteer participation provides similar information as a scientific sampling approach. Six CAMP stations and six stations selected using a stratified random design were sampled at ten estuaries. A permutational-MANOVA revealed nekton assemblages were generally not significantly different between the two sampling designs. The current six CAMP stations are sufficient to detect the larger differences in species abundances that may indicate differences in estuary condition. The predicted increase in precision (2%) with twelve stations is not substantive enough to warrant an increased sampling effort. CAMP's scientific utility is not limited by station selection bias or numbers. Furthermore, well-designed CBMPs can produce comparable data to scientific studies.

AB  - Quantification of total phenolic compounds in the heartwood of Picea abies using the Folin-Ciocalteu methods showed that concentrations of phenolic compounds in the heart- and sapwood of Picea abies varied, depending on the decay class to which boles were allocated. In the heartwood, mean phenolic concentration was 3.28 mg/g, compared with 2.44 mg/g in sapwood. Experiments using different concentrations of phenolic compounds showed that Heterobasidion parviporum is more sensitive to the effects of phenolic compounds found in sapwood, and less sensitive to phenolic compounds found in heartwood. The high concentration of phenolic compounds extracted from spruce stimulated the decomposition of wood by Armillaria ostoyae. This demonstrates the great ability of A. ostoyae to metabolize phenolic compounds. This is confirmed by natural conditions, where A. ostoyae attacks mainly sapwood and H. parviporum attacks heartwood of P. abies. In heartwood, the average antioxidant activity was approximately 10% higher than in the sapwood. The extraction process and presence of amino acids and reducing sugars might influence on the results. The results suggest that timber quality monitoring in spruce stands could be partly based on measurements of phenol compound concentrations in sapwood, as the technique enables prediction of the potential impact of decay fungi early in succession.

AB  - Composites containing bio-based materials, like banana fiber and poly(lactic acid) (PLA), are potential food-packaging materials. We carried out an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of coffee jar lids made from high density polyethylene (HDPE), PLA, and banana fiber to assess their environmental performance. We considered differences in the type of blend (content of PLA and banana fiber in the composite), origin of the banana fiber feedstock (considered as either biowaste or as a co-product from banana production) and banana fiber pretreatment conditions (either no pretreatment or pretreatment using chemicals). Irrespective of the scenario, a lid made from 40% banana fiber and equal amounts of HDPE and PLA performed significantly better in all 18 impact categories when compared to a lid made from 100% PLA. By contrast, the same lid performed significantly better in 3 impact categories only (climate change, photochemical oxidant formation and fossil depletion) when compared to a lid made from 100% HDPE. Thus, environmental performance of the bio-composite strongly depends on which polymer base is replaced by the banana fiber in the composite. Replacing PLA with banana fiber is generally expected to bring environmental benefits.

AB  - The features of the cardiovascular system regulation form a direct relationship between the nature of the nervous system activity during sleep and such indicators as blood pressure and heart rate. Interruption of sleep or its disturbance can have a negative effect on the functional state of heart and vascular bed. The mechanisms of this effect can be both the violations of sleep cyclic phases, and direct decreases of physiological functions, in particular, the development of hypoxia episodes. They determined a reliable relationship between the presence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. The presence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome increases the risk of cardiovascular disease development by 2.4 times as compared with the population without respiratory disorders during sleep. Significantly higher body mass index values were found in the groups of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Repeated hypoxic conditions can cause persistent disruption of gas exchange processes and further sleep impairment. The interdependence of sleep disorders and circulatory functions creates a vicious circle of pathogenetic influences, which ultimately leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular pathology and associated mortality development. The evaluation of drowsiness as a screening method for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome determination among the patients with cardiovascular diseases, especially among those with treatment-resistant forms. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea requires a polysomnographic study.

AB  - For decades, formative assessment has been identified as a high-impact instructional practice that positively affects student learning. Education reform documents such as Vision and Change: A Call to Action expressly identify frequent, ongoing formative assessment and feedback as a key instructional practice in student-centered learning environments. Historically, effect sizes between 0.4 and 0.7 have been reported for formative assessment experiments. However, more recent meta-analyses have reported much tower effect sizes. It is unclear whether the variability in reported effects is due to formative assessment as an instructional practice in and of itself, differences in how formative assessment was enacted across studies, or other mitigating factors. We propose that application of a fidelity of implementation (FOI) framework to define the critical components of formative assessment will increase the validity of future impact studies. In this Essay, we apply core principles from the FOI literature to hypothesize about the critical components of formative assessment as a high-impact instructional practice. In doing so, we begin the iterative process through which further research can develop valid and reliable measures of the FOI of formative assessment. Such measures are necessary to empirically determine when, how, and under what conditions formative assessment supports student learning.

AB  - A challenge for the environmental recovery of degraded areas is the search for soil data. In this process, the microbiological parameters and soil chemicals are potential indicators of soil quality. This study aimed to evaluate soil quality based on microbiological and chemical soil attributes in different areas involving environmental recovery, sugarcane cultivation and remnants of native vegetation located in a rural private property farm in State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in Hapludox Eutrophic soil. The microbiological (microbial biomass carbon, basal respiration, microbial quotient and metabolic quotient) and chemical parameters (organic matter, carbon, pH, cationic exchange capacity, sum of bases, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, saturation base and potential acidity) were assessed. Data were assessed by variance and multivariate analysis (Principal Component Analysis and cluster analysis). Overall, the results showed highest alteration in the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the soil in sugarcane cultivation area in comparison with other areas. Considering the studied recovery areas, REC1, REC5 and REC7 show chemical and microbiological conditions with most similarity to native vegetation. Despite the short period of the resilience enhancement of environmental recovery areas, the development of vegetation cover and establishment of the microbial community were determined to be important factors for improving soil quality and environmental recovery in several of the areas studied.

AB  - The degree of social vulnerability may vary according to the conditions and backgrounds of different locations, yet spatial clustering phenomena may exist when nearby spatial units exhibit similar characteristics. This study applied spatial autocorrelation statistics to analyze the spatial association of vulnerability among townships in Taiwan. The vulnerability was first assessed on the basis of a social vulnerability index that was constructed using Fuzzy Delphi and analytic hierarchy process methods. Subsequently, the corresponding indicator variables were applied to calculate standardized vulnerability assessment scores by using government data. According to the results of the vulnerability assessment in which T scores were normalized, the distribution of social vulnerabilities varied among the townships. The scores were further analyzed using spatial autocorrelation statistics for spatial clustering of vulnerability distribution. The Local G statistic identified 42 significant spatial association pockets, whereas the Global G statistic indicated no spatial phenomenon of clustering. This phenomenon was verified and explained by applying Moran's I statistics to examine the homogeneity and heterogeneity of spatial associations. Although both statistics were originally designed to identify the existence of spatial clustering, they serve diverse purposes, and the results can be compared to obtain additional insights into the distribution patterns of social vulnerability.

AB  - Plastic packaging has many development drivers: providing enhanced functionalities, better barrier properties, and longer shelf life while taking into account the environment and respecting criteria of thermo-mechanical performance. As a single polymer cannot satisfy all these requirements, plastic products are often made of more than one polymer and/or more than one single layer, each one having different but complementary properties. This work aims at investigating the over-moulding of PA6 over PP-g-MA in order to optimise the adhesion of multilayer PP/PA6 injection-moulded parts, as PP and PA6 are not miscible. Among the processing parameters, the holding pressure was found to be the main parameter governing the peeling strength of the multilayer assembly. The change of the polymer structure was evaluated by optical microscopy coupled to infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microcopy. The PA6/PP-g-MA interfacial properties were investigated by dynamic rheology and assessed in term of quadratic distance of diffusion through the interface. For this purpose, the variation of the temperature field of the assembly during the cooling stage of the manufacturing process was simulated using the heat transfer module of a finite elements software package.

AB  - Dry grasslands are plant communities with major importance for biodiversity. In this study, xeric grasslands of the order Festucetalia valesiacae from North-Eastern Romania were analyzed, in 45 nested series, at seven grain sizes (0.0001-100 m(2)), sampled in 5 plant communities within above mentioned phytosociological unit. The aim was to test the relative importance of different environmental factors on species richness (alpha-diversity) and species turnover (beta-diversity), the last one expressed as the exponent of the power-law species-area relationship, and to detect which is the influence of spatial scale on diversity-environment relationship. Generalized linear models were used to assess the relative importance of predictors in shaping diversity in all seven spatial scales. The results showed that diversity-environment relationships were dependent on the scale of analysis, different factors being influential at different spatial scales. Local environmental conditions and land use practices were more related to species richness while general soil characteristics explained a larger proportion of spatial species turnover. In conclusion, diversity-environment relationships in the xeric grasslands from North-Eastern Romania are scale dependent, with local factors more important at small spatial scales and soil parameters more important for larger scales.

AB  - The pore structure and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) in seawater concrete as indicators of marine concrete durability are explored and analysed. Mercury intrusion porosimetry, microhardness tester and scanning electron microscopy are employed to characterise the evolution of the pore structure and ITZ with curing time. Effects of mineral admixtures including slag, silica fume and metakaolin on pore structure and ITZ are also investigated. In addition, the influence of slag, silica fume and metakaolin on the thermodynamic stability of hydrate phases is investigated. The experimental results show that, compared to normal concrete, concrete subjected to simulated seawater conditions at early ages has a higher ratio of fine porosity as well as higher ITZ microhardness, and the ITZ is narrower. However, the microstructure of concrete in the seawater environment degrades up to longer ages. With the addition of mineral admixtures, the pore characteristics of marine concrete are greatly improved. The effect of the mineral admixtures on microstructure is in the sequence: metakaolin > silica fume > slag. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that stable hydration products ettringite (C6AsH32:6CaO center dot Al2O3.3CaSO(4).32H(2)O) and siliceous hydrogarnet (C3As0.8H4.4:3CaO center dot Al2O3 center dot 0.8SiO(2)center dot 4.4H(2)O) form due to pozzolanic reactions to optimise the microstructure and enhance the compressive strength of concrete.

AB  - Rotifers have often been used as indicators of sudden changes in physical and chemical features of the aquatic environment. Such features vary greatly during flood pulse events in small lakes connected to major floodplains. However, few are the studies that investigate the consequences of the flood pulse in rotifer species composition, abundance, richness and diversity, especially in Amazonian lakes. We analyzed samples from a small blackwater lake of an "igarap" connected permanently to the Negro river, in Central Amazonia. Samples were taken twice a year for two years, comprising flooding and receding periods of the flood pulse. Rotifer abundance increased significantly after draught events, and electrical conductivity and turbidity were intrinsically related to such variation. Species composition also changed from flooding to receding periods. Some taxa, such as Brachionus zahniseri reductus and Lecane remanei were restricted to receding periods, while Brachionus zahniseri, Brachionus gillardi and Lecane proiecta were only present during flooding. A shift in the composition of rotifer families was observed from one period to another, showing the effect of renewing waters of the flood pulse. These results suggest that the flood pulse acts as a driving force and stressing condition, considerably altering rotifer community dynamics, either changing species composition or decreasing abundance.

AB  - The fate assessment of nanomaterials in municipal sewage treatment plants (STP) is a crucial step for their environmental risk assessment and may be assessed by monitoring full scale STP, dosage to medium scale pilot SIP or by laboratory testing. For regulatory purposes preferably standardised test protocols such as the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals should be used. However, these test protocols have not yet been specifically designed for nanoparticles. Therefore, the fate and behavior of a TiO2 nanomaterial (P25, average hydrodynamic diameter <250 nm) was investigated in laboratory sewage treatment plants according to the OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals 303 A. It is concluded that this guideline is applicable for the testing of nanomaterials if modifications regarding the dosage, nitrifying conditions, and a characterisation of the nanoparticles in the effluent are applied. A compilation of the cumulative mass balance by comparison of the total dosage added with the amount in the outflow and in the activated sludge is recommended. In this study, the majority of the TiO2 nanomaterial (>95%) was retained in the sewage sludge and only 3-4% was found in the effluent. No effect of the TiO2 nanomaterials on the biodegradation or nitrification was observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper focuses on the physics of sprays using large eddy simulation (LES) and Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). The LES/LPT was compared to previously unpublished experimental fuel spray data in two ambient gas densities, 39 and 115 kg/m(3). The higher density case corresponds to a near-future engine environment with maximum cylinder pressure of the order of 300 bar, whereas the lower density case resembles typical present-day engine conditions. The accuracy of the results was quantified by calculating the resolved part of the turbulent kinetic energy and using a LES quality index analysis. The sprays produced by the LES/LPT had many similarities with the experimental sprays. On a global scale, spray penetration, spray opening angle, and spray dispersion were found to be well captured by the LES/LPT. The results indicated that the effect of subgrid scales on particle dispersion was small and hence no explicit particle dispersion model was required. Similarities were also found locally as LES/LPT produced small-scale flow structures indicated by the Q-criterion, preferential concentrations, and voids free of droplets. Finally, we propose a new gas phase mixing indicator in order to quantify turbulent mixing. Results from the novel mixing indicator suggest that for a given spray penetration, the higher ambient gas density spray yields an increased mixing rate.

AB  - The diversity of groundwater mycobiota remains relatively unknown and unchartered. As a first description of the fungal diversity in Australian aquifers we explored the distribution, abundance and diversity of fungal assemblages in samples from an alluvial (Bylong) and two sandy (Tomago; Botany Sands) unconfined aquifers in coastal catchments of NSW, Australia. A total of 89 strains were isolated with 54 Eumycotan taxa identified. The Botany Sands aquifer, with a history of industrial chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination along a hydraulic gradient, yielded the highest richness with 23 identifiable taxa, followed by Tomago with 17 and Bylong with 14. Despite differences in geology and land use, the aquifers shared similarities in their fungal assemblages with Penicillium, Rhodotorula, Paecilomyces and Cladosporium spp. common to all sites. Fungal assemblages were notably similar between the Bylong and Tomago samples and differed from the Botany samples in composition and heterogeneity. Taxa appeared to cluster into two main groups according to their association with environmental conditions; with the taxa common to the Botany aquifer correlating strongly with higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. The diversity and spatial heterogeneity of groundwater mycobiota appeared to be influenced by both anthropogenic contaminants and associated environmental variables. Based on the criteria of ubiquity, abundance and potential sensitivity to contamination, Penicillium and Rhodotorula spp. might be fitting taxa for monitoring groundwater quality.

AB  - Biophysical and socioeconomic conditions of pre and post dam construction were assessed in one of the arid regions of Iran commanded by Minab dam. The methodology used in this study was drawn from the international organizations especially the World Commission on Dams and the United Nations for selection of the indicators for sustainable development relating to water resources projects. Commissioning of the dam in 1986 led to progressive expansion of the irrigated agriculture, which was almost doubled in year 2006. Results of the study revealed that there is significant positive impact of the irrigation infrastructures of the dam; for example literacy rate has increased from 41 % (pre project) to 74 % in 2006. Similarly, significant improvements were observed in health care, sanitation, education and other scopes. Nevertheless, for some of the targets only 50-60 % progress were made, whereas no significant achievements had been made in the others. Therefore, development did not match with the planned goals of the project. Deficiency in achieving the primary objectives, especially after many years of project completion, may be attributed to the management and implementation of the project. For effective project performance, a new institutional framework and guide lines are proposed in this article.

AB  - The present study aimed to enrich the group of sentinel organisms of terrestrial pollution biomonitoring, by investigating the efficacy of the land snail Eobania vermiculata. For this reason, a package of biomarkers was performed on land snails E. vermiculata collected from polluted areas in the field or treated with heavy metals in the laboratory. The biomarkers used were neutral red lysosomal retention assay of the haemocytes, acetylcholinesterase activity in the digestive gland and the haemolymph, and metallothionein content of the digestive gland. Moreover, the morphometric changes in the lysosomal system and the morphometric alterations of the neutral lipids were also investigated. In addition, the content of cadmium, lead and copper was evaluated in the digestive gland of the snails. The results revealed appreciable alterations in the biomarker values both in field- and laboratory-conditions, accompanied by significant correlations among the biomarkers. Therefore, this exploratory study suggests the utility of E. vermiculata as a sentinel organism for biomonitoring the biologic impact of terrestrial pollution, and supports the package's efficacy of the selected biomarkers.

AB  - While Escherichia coli is widely used as an indicator of fecal contamination of waterways, recent studies suggest that this bacterium may become "naturalized" to soils. In this study, we investigated the survival and growth of naturalized E. coli in temperate soil in northern Minnesota. A spontaneously-occurring, antibiotic resistant E. coli strain, KS7-NR, was added to a field site at 103 cells (gsoil)(-1). The survival and growth of E. coli KS7-NR were followed from June to October, by using colony counts on agar plates supplemented with antibiotics, and by using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with strain-specific primers developed based on suppressive subtractive hybridization. Both plate count and qPCR analyses indicated that E. coli KS7-NR survived for more than 2 months in the field soil. Laboratory experiments showed that soil temperature, moisture, nutrients, and the presence of other soil organisms influenced growth and survival of E. coli KS7-NR in soil. Moreover, our results indicated that summer drought conditions that occurred during the field study likely limited in situ growth of E. coli at the field site. Taken together, these results suggest that E. coli strains can survive long-term and grow in soils, provided that abiotic factors are within their tolerance limits.

AB  - In this study we develop an "inference modeling" approach to compare and analyze how different disciplines (economics, political science, and behavioral science/environmental psychology) estimate vulnerability to drought. It is thought that a better understanding of these differences can lead to a synthesis of insights from the different disciplines and eventually to more comprehensive assessments of vulnerability. The new methodology consists of (1) developing inference models whose variables and assertions incorporate qualitative knowledge about vulnerability, (2) converting qualitative model variables into quantitative indicators by using fuzzy set theory, (3) collecting data on the values of the indicators from case study regions, (4) inputting the regional data to the models and computing quantitative values for susceptibility. The methodology was applied to three case study regions (in India, Portugal and Russia) having a range of socio-economic and water stress conditions. In some cases the estimates of susceptibility were surprisingly similar, in others not, depending on the factors included in the disciplinary models and their relative weights. A new approach was also taken to testing vulnerability parameters by comparing estimated water stress against a data set of drought occurrences based on media analysis. The new methodologies developed in this paper provide a consistent basis for comparing differences between disciplinary perspectives, and for identifying the importance of the differences.

AB  - Grosmannia clavigera is the most pathogenic blue-staining fungal associate of the Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae). In contrast to its importance as a primary invader of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) sapwood, intraspecific variability in pathogenicity of G. clavigera on lodgepole pine, the predominant host of mountain pine beetles in British Columbia, has not been investigated in detail. The present work reports on pathogenicity indicators induced by five G. clavigera isolates inoculated into lodgepole pines and growth characteristics of the C into Young lodgepole pine trees. Phloem isolates oil artificial media. Fungi were inoculated Lit 200 inoculations/m(2) lesion length, sapwood occlusion area, and sapwood Moisture content were measured after 7 or 48 weeks. Three isolates produced long lesions, Occluded larger areas, and reduced more the moisture content after 48 weeks compared with the remaining two isolates. Isolate ATCC 18086 induced the strongest pathogenic symptoms after 7 weeks and grew the fastest Lip to 22.5 degrees C but grew the slowest at 27.5 degrees C. In a low-oxygen environment, most isolates grew faster than under ambient conditions. Significant intraspecific variation was observed among G. clavigera isolates for all parameters tested.

AB  - A new vibration sensor for monitoring the operational status of exhaust fans in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and other ventilated structures was developed and tested. The sensor utilizes integrated Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (iMEMS) technology to accurately and reliably detect the vibration of agricultural fans, an indicator of fan operating status. When coupled with a sensor to measure pressure drop across the fan and an appropriate fan performance curve, the vibration sensor can enable the collection of real-time building ventilation airflow data. The sensor integrated an iMEMS accelerometer along with signal conditioning components to convert the cyclic acceleration signal into a filtered TTL digital signal appropriate for a wide variety of data acquisition equipment. Sensor current draw was 0.9 mA, which allowed multiple devices to operate from a single power bus. Laboratory and field testing has shown that the sensor is 99% effective in determining the total on-time of agricultural fans when compared with existing methods. Testing has also shown that the sensor response is not affected by changes in operating environment temperature. Sensor installation takes only a few minutes and requires only a single hole placed in the existing fan mounting structure. Furthermore, by encapsulating the sensor in a potting compound, all critical electronic components can be sealed tom the corrosive effects of moisture and gases common to CAFOs and other ventilated structures.

AB  - A 12m deep core from the sediments of Lagoa Dourada, Parana State, southern Brazil, was analyzed about its diatoms, extractable inorganic cations (Ca++, Mg++, K+), available phosphorus, organic matter, water contents and sedimentology. Studies of the lake sequence, with a basal date of 11, 110 +/- 110 yr BP, provide a history of climatic changes divided into nine zones. Zone A I (prior to 11,000 yr BP) contains diatom taxa suggesting dry environments. Zone B I (around 11,000 yr BP) indicates very humid climatic conditions synchronous with reduced temperatures. Around 8,710 +/- 150 yr BP, the core does not contain diatoms, and the convergence of some paleoclimatic indicators suggests that a drier paleoclimate is represented. Zone A2 and B2 have planktonic diatom spectra that suggest progressive high humidity. A marked decline in moisture levels is expressed in Zone C, as suggested by an increase in only one dominant periphytic taxon. The following periods (Zones D1, D2 and D3) were characterized by several water level oscillations, with short and intensive dry events and longer intervening humid periods. Zone E establishes the present diatom and climatic pattern of Lagoa Dourada. Cultural disturbances could be indicated by the high K+ levels detected on the core top, which are probably due to the agricultural boom in the catchment area.

AB  - Noctilucent clouds (NLC) are a beautiful, high-latitude, summertime phenomenon that was first reported over 100 years ago. They are seen during the hours of twilight by the scattering of sunlight from sub-micron-sized ice particles that form in the vicinity of the cold mesopause region. NLC are quite distinctive, often appearing silvery-blue in color. In recent years there has been a marked increase in their frequency of occurrence, possibly due to an increase in mesospheric water vapor and/or to a cooling of the mesopause region, prompting speculation that they are "harbingers" of potentially serious changes in the mesospheric climate. In concert with this trend there are also a growing number of ground-based NLC sightings at significantly lower latitudes than expected. Here we report two unusual NLC displays photographed from Logan, UT, USA (similar to42degreesN) during June 1999, well over 10 lower in latitude than expected and implying a major, yet temporary, departure from normal mid-latitude summertime conditions. These data provide new evidence for the occasional expansion of NLC to unusually low latitudes possibly due to exceptional dynamical forcing. Alternatively, they may be an early indicator of significant long-term changes taking place in the upper mesospheric summertime environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The agricultural development of southern Australia oiler the past 200 years has resulted in extensively fragmented systems, often with only small, isolated remnants of native vegetation remaining. Grazing by sheep and cattle has affected both the remaining fragments and the surrounding matrix, and non-native plant and animal species have had dramatic effects on the native biota, Invasive plant species have the potential to significantly alter ecosystem composition and functioning, and invasive animals, particularly rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculatus), foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and cats (Felis catus) effectively alter habitat and drive native fauna to local extinction. These different influences often interact. For instance, smaller fragments are often more prone to plant invasion and are more likely to have been grazed in the past. Invasion of plant species is often linked with livestock grazing or rabbit invasion, and other higher-order interactions are also apparent Classical fragmentation studies that concentrate on parameters such cis habitat area and isolation but Ignore changes in habitat condition brought about by livestock and invasive species are unlikely to yield meaningful results. Similarly, management of fragmented ecosystems must account for not only the spatial characteristics of the remaining habitat but also the importance of other influences, particularly those that impinge on fragments from the surrounding matrix.

AB  - This paper describes the trade of dry medicinal plants in the southwestern area of the state of Puebla, Mexico. Gatherers who collect medicinal plants represent the poorest economic link in the trade chain. The critical socioeconomic situation of the human population is reflected in the state of the wild plants at the zone, as a result of an increase in their use for economic survival. The stock of medicinal plants handled by regional traders is an indicator of the abundance and diversity of the flora present in the zone, and permits a dynamic exchange of these products with regional traders from outside. Tracing the commercial path of six medicinal plants from the field to the market, only 6.17% of the consumer price, on average, was returned to the collectors. Most of the medicinal plants marketed and used in Mexico are wild plants. This fact, combined with the increasing demand that exists for medicinal plants in this region, create a potential environmental threat. Since this threat is a multifactorial one, involving the complex socioeconomic conditions in which rur al workers and their families live, conservation programs for the wild flora (including reassessed gathering methods, production of selected medicinal species and protection of wild populations and market regulations of quality and equity) have to be applied within an organizational framework of the gatherers and peasants in the zone.

AB  - Solanum brachycarpum Plant Introduction 498021 reacted with necrotic symptoms when inoculated with various isolates of the tobacco veinal necrosis strain of potato virus Y (PVY(N)). Symptoms consisted of necrotic local lesions, wilting of leaflets, collapse of petioles, and death of entire plants within 7-10 days after inoculation. Inoculating S. brachycarpum plants with isolates of the common strain, PVY(O), produced mosaic symptoms within 13-16 days. Potato viruses M, S, and X did not cause any visible symptoms in S. brachycarpum plants, but potato virus A produced mosaic symptoms. Since the presence of potato virus X (PVX) in S. brachycarpum plants or simultaneous inoculation with PVX and PVY did not change the PVY symptomatology, there is no need to remove PVX from the sample, as is required for PVY(N) detection with the tobacco bioassay. Necrotic symptoms caused by PVY(N) isolates appeared at a temperature range of 20-35 C and at a light intensity of 48-72 to 140-196 muE.s-1.m-2. Therefore, this plant is suitable for bioassay under a range of environmental conditions. S. brachycarpum developed symptoms typical of either PVY(N) or PVY(O) isolates when inoculated with samples from potato foliage, sprouts, or tubers infected with those strains.

AB  - Major depression is a severe mental disorder that is associated with strongly increased mortality. The quantification of its prevalence on regional levels represents an important indicator for public health reporting. In addition to that, it marks a crucial basis for further explorative studies regarding environmental determinants of the condition. However, assessing the distribution of major depression in the population is challenging. The topic is highly sensitive, and national statistical institutions rarely have administrative records on this matter. Published prevalence figures as well as available auxiliary data are typically derived from survey estimates. These are often subject to high uncertainty due to large sampling variances and do not allow for sound regional analysis. We propose a new area-level Poisson mixed model that accounts for measurement errors in auxiliary data to close this gap. We derive the empirical best predictor under the model and present a parametric bootstrap estimator for the mean squared error. A method of moments algorithm for consistent model parameter estimation is developed. Simulation experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the approach. The methodology is applied to estimate the major depression prevalence in Germany on regional levels crossed by sex and age groups.

AB  - Treatment of effluents from animal slaughterhouse industries is indispensable, standing out coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation processes. Bionanoparticles (BioNPs) (nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with Moringa extracts (MO)) were studied as an alternative natural coagulant that would contribute to the microbial load reduction, without increasing the treated effluent toxicity. MO extracts were prepared with different salts, and then, in a kinetics study, different NPs mass and coagulant dosages were evaluated. In the best-defined conditions, microbial load, toxicity tests for the bioindicator Lactuca sativa, and NPs reuse evaluation were performed. Removals of 96.14% turbidity and 43.63% UV254nm were achieved when using 500 mg L-1 of BioNPs containing 60 mg of NPs for every 20 mL of MO extract prepared with 0.1 M CaCl2. The BioNPs with an external magnetic field also decreased the sedimentation time from 140 to 10 min compared to MO, and the process efficiency did not expressively decrease after reusing the recovered NPs. Through toxicity tests, BioNPs were not considered to leave residuals toxic to the Lactuca sativa in the treated effluent. Besides, the microbial load reduction was 97.33% for heterotrophic microorganisms and total mesophiles and 99.25% for moulds/yeasts. Therefore, a satisfactory primary treatment was achieved, contributing to the sustainability of industries.

AB  - The small terrestrial gastropod Vertigo pseudosubstriata Lozek, 1954 is one of the rarest glacial indicator species in the Pleistocene of Central and Eastern Europe. In all, this species has been found at only about 15 sites in Europe. V. pseudosubstriata was initially described as a fossil in Central Europe and was discovered only later alive in Central Asia. With regard to its modern distribution, 25 habitats with V. pseudosubstriata have been examined in Tien Shan and in the central and southern Altai. These findings seem to capture the contemporary distribution of the species and provide information on the boundaries of its ecological requirements. These data are of great significance for the interpretation of the fossil assemblages. Since the few fossil specimens in Europe date from very different glacial periods in the Elsterian, Saalian Complex and Weichselian, it can be concluded that V. pseudosubstriata apparently immigrated in at least three distinct waves. Most of the Pleistocene specimens in eastern Central Europe and Eastern Europe are reported from archaeological sites of the Upper Middle Weichselian (Gravettian), roughly between 33 and 29 ka cal bp. In this paper, we review all reported modern and fossil occurrences and discuss the species' ecological range.

AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the working dynasties representation in the Soviet cinematography. The theoretical research model is based on several approaches: the continuity of generations concept; the concept of social capital and social production strategies; studies of the socio-professional structure in the Soviet society; studies of labor dynasties in Russian society; the concept of "the myth of the great family" and its application in the official discourse analysis. Analyzed information sources are 43 Soviet films released from 1920s to 1980s. The article substantiates the presence of several stages in the dynastic themes presentation in the Soviet cinematography. The periodization criteria are: 1) ideological conditions and assessment of the working dynasty potential in the Soviet society; 2) genre, visual-aesthetic and resource characteristics of the film production; 3) the nature of intergenerational translation of social and professional experience. The first period (1924-1953) is characterized by discursive negativity in the propaganda films of generational continuity in the parental family. The configurational type of social and professional experience transition dominates. At the second stage (1954-1965), in accordance with the ideology, the constructive potential of labor succession in the family is emphasized in the chronicles. This stage is characterized by a post-figurative type of generational continuity. At the third stage (mid-60s-80s) there is ambivalence in the representation of working dynasties.

AB  - Zostera marina is a dominant meadow-forming seagrass in temperate regions in the northern hemisphere. Here, fatty acid content and composition, and pigmentation, in leaves were evaluated across temporal (April, July, November -2015 and January-2016) and latitudinal (Greenland to southern Spain) environmental gradients. Content of total fatty acids (TFA) in samples collected in Ireland during warmer periods (summer) was 2-3 times lower than in winter and exhibited a lower proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which have high high-nutritional value relative to saturated fatty acids (SAFA). The latitudinal comparison (Greenland to southern Spain) revealed a clear reduction in the proportion n-3 PUFAs and an increase in n-6 PUFA and SAFA, which correlated with the rise in temperature towards southern locations, which correlated with the rise in temperature towards south. Results indicate that future warming may negatively affect its lipid nutritional value. These results demonstrate the capacity of seagrasses to adjust their lipid composition to achieve optimal membrane functionality, suggesting the potential use of FA as an eco-physiological indicator of global change conditions. The results also suggest that future warming may negatively affect the lipid nutritional value of seagrasses.

AB  - Extreme weather conditions of the Arctic and its icy waters pose high-risk potential for a range of marine accidents in the region. Ship-ice collision is the focus of this paper. A large number of vessels operating in the Arctic waters are at risk of ice damage due to ship-ice collisions. The damage may vary from a minor hull deformation to ruptures that could put the lives, assets, and environment at risk. To minimize the risk of ship-ice collision in Arctic waters, a simple yet robust model to make routine safety-driven operational decisions could help. The present study proposes a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model to fill this gap. The model assesses the operational risk of ship-ice collision in an ice prone region using the hypothetical form of observations. Low temperatures, Weather, Ice, Fog, Darkness, Blowing snow, Poor visibility, Ice strength, Ice drift, Types of ice, Ice concentration and Speed of the vessel are considered as the primary risk factors in the region. The estimated collision risk would provide an easy to use indicator for decisions concerning safe operations in ice such as maneuvering, route selection, and safe speed. A case study of an oil tanker navigating across the Barents Sea is presented to explain the proposed model.

AB  - Introduction
   The effectiveness of repetitive transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on reducing smoking behaviour has been studied with mixed results. Smoking behaviour is influenced by affect and context, therefore we choose to use mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMA) to measure changes in smoking behaviour after tDCS.
   Methods
   In a randomized, placebo-controlled, between subject study, we applied tDCS bilaterally with the anodal electrode targeting the right DLPFC (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT03027687). Smokers were allocated to six sessions of either active tDCS (n = 35) or sham tDCS (n = 36) and received two sessions on three different days in one week. They were asked to keep track of their daily cigarette consumption, craving and affect in an application on their mobile phones for three months starting one week before the first tDCS session.
   Results
   Number of smoked cigarettes a day progressively decreased up to one week after the last tDCS session in both conditions. Active treatment had no additional effect on cigarette consumption, craving and affect.
   Conclusions
   In this exploratory study, repetitive bilateral tDCS over the DLPFC had no effect on daily smoking behaviour. Future research needs to investigate how motivation to quit smoking and the number of tDCS sessions affect the efficacy of repetitive tDCS.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry is the non-directional deviations from bilateral symmetry and occurs across organisms. Fish otoliths are often used to test for differences in symmetry as otoliths aid in hearing, homing, and balance. Here, we evaluated the symmetry of otolith pairs in adult Chinook Salmon between wild and hatchery-origin stocks. Pacific salmon are economically and ecologically important to the Pacific Northwest, USA. Chinook Salmon are widely distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean, yet several wild populations are federally listed as endangered or threatened due to depleted stocks, loss of genetic diversity, and hatchery contribution to wild stocks. As such, fishery managers are concerned with the health and condition of hatchery-origin fish and their impacts on wild populations. We included both hatchery and wild-origin Chinook Salmon from the Coast Mountain and Willamette regions in Oregon as well as hatchery populations from southeast Alaska. We evaluated several metrics to test shape variation and symmetry between the left and right sagittal otoliths. We found consistently more asymmetry in otoliths from hatchery origin than wild Chinook Salmon within seven out of eight total metrics. These results could have conservation and management implications as hatchery-origin Chinook Salmon can reduce pressure from wild stocks while continuing to support commercial and recreational industries.

AB  - In view of the content of bridge condition assessment and health monitoring, this paper is based on the finite element simulation analysis. The uncertain finite element model updating method based on sequential optimization strategy is studied, and the uncertain modal parameter data obtained by health monitoring system are applied to upgrade the uncertain finite element model of cable-stayed bridges, which provides a more accurate finite element model for subsequent reliability analysis. Firstly, the finite element dynamic analysis of the main span structure of the bridge is carried out, and the natural frequencies and modes are obtained. Then the measured natural frequencies of the structure are obtained by estimating the power spectrum of the dynamic monitoring data, and the theoretical values are compared with the measured ones. The dynamic characteristics of the modified two-stayed bridge finite element model are verified by the load test results. The results show that the modified finite element model can simulate the dynamic characteristics of the actual structure well. Most of the measured and calculated displacement increments were within the margin of error. The error is within 5%, which can accurately reflect the true stress state of the structure. The uncertainty model based on the sequential optimization strategy is simple and can be applied to the uncertainty of the finite element model of the actual bridge structure.

AB  - The primary goal of this paper is to suggest potential methods of post-mining areas management. Moreover, such methods must be compliant with the expectations of the residents of a given area. The assessment of natural and socio-economic factors affecting the choice of optimum reclamation and revitalization approaches was carried out using the following research methods: analysis of the available literature, case study, field research, photographic documentation. An analysis of the impact of deposit exploitation of mineral aggregates on protected species and their habitats located within the Natura 2000 sites was done. The scale of the problem is enormous. A proper approach needs to be developed among the economy, society and organization of managing the network The Natura 2000 network covers huge areas simultaneously utilized for other purposes than nature conservation. The Natura 2000 network is in serious conflict with industry, especially with open-pit mining due to the location of mineral deposits. The results can be used to resolve conflict situations on Natura 2000 sites. An undertaking will only receive a go-ahead if it exerts no negative impact on a given area and if the public approves of it. Plans and undertakings having a negative impact on a given area are authorized but on the condition that mitigating measures are taken.

AB  - Triazoles and 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate (IPBC) are commonly used wood preservatives active against a wide range of fungi and bacteria. As they are prone to leaching, their amounts need to be monitored by the industry to determine preservative loss from the products and for environmental impact assessment. Therefore, a liquid chromatography-electrospray-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-TOFMS) method was developed and optimized for simultaneous quantification of triazoles and IPBC in aqueous wood extracts, specifically wood leachate. Analyte pre-concentration on a solid-phase extraction cartridge prior to the analysis yielded >94% recoveries. ESI method parameters (e.g., solvent system, electrolyte type, electrolyte concentration, capillary and fragmentor voltages) were selected based on an initial screening followed by an in-depth optimization via design of experiments. The optimal conditions employed an acetonitrile-water solvent system with 1.7 mM ammonium acetate, capillary voltage of 4350 V, and fragmentor voltage of 115 V. The developed method was applied to industrial wood leachate samples and the matrix-affected limits of detection were found to be 1.2-1.5 mu g L-1 with interlay repeatability being <7%.

AB  - Hydric soil identification utilizes diagnostic morphologic features, including iron transformations, resulting from anaerobic conditions. However, soils derived from some red parent materials (RPM) fail to develop characteristic hydric soils morphologies, confounding hydric soil and wetland delineation. Laboratory and field methods addressing resistant RPM soils exist, but application remains limited by uncertainty regarding problematic RPM distribution. In response, a collaborative effort (>50 participants) documented problematic RPM distribution across the contiguous United States. Specifically, >1100 samples from >450 locations underwent laboratory analysis using the Color Change Propensity Index to identify problematic RPM soils. Geospatial analysis linked verified problematic soils with associated geologic units and soil series, generating maps of RPM distribution. Potential problematic RPM was identified in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, South-central, and Desert Southwest-Western Mountains (problematic RPM regions herein), encompassing diverse groups of soils and parent materials. Despite the observed variability in soil characteristics, results suggest that problematic RPM was consistently derived from sedimentary, hematite-rich red bed formations developed where deposition of terrestrial sediments occurred in near-shore, marginal-marine environments. Understanding problematic RPM soils distribution promotes the appropriate application of existing hydric soil field indicators, including F21 - Red Parent Material, thus improving approaches to hydric soil identification and wetland management.

AB  - Heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of toxic compounds are extremely important for many applications including environmental remediation. Here, we assessed the ability of Ti-substituted magnetite, i.e., titanomagnetite (Fe-III ((2-2x)) Fe-II ((1+x)) TixO4) to promote Fenton-like heterogeneous reactions. Two titanomagnetites with x values respectively equal to 0.25 (TM0.25) and 0.75 (TM0.75), as well as unsubstituted magnetite (M, x = 0) were tested for the degradation of phenol under different conditions. Kinetic assessments over 1 h reaction time showed that all the studied systems had the best performance at pH 3. This is the typical, optimal pH value of the Fenton reaction. Moreover, titanomagnetite-based systems were active at low loading and afforded the application of relatively low H2O2 doses. The titanomagnetites had lower ability than magnetite to induce phenol degradation at pH > 3. However, presumably because of the higher Fe(II) content, TM0.75 was less susceptible than M or TM0.25 to the loss in reactivity caused by air exposure. TM0.75 can thus be handled in ambient systems or O-2-containing environments, which may be a key advantage from an application point of view.

AB  - The particle size distribution of particulate matter (PM) and concentrations of water-soluble ions were observed in airborne aerosol in the City of Ostrava (the Czech Republic, Moravian-Silesian Region) during winter 2016. The Ostrava area ranks among the most polluted areas not only within the Czech Republic but also in Europe due to the high concentration of industry, especially metallurgy, in this area. The selected water-soluble ions: were studied in different grain size classes of particulate matter separated into 7 fractions (from 0.0175 to 9.93 mu m) collected by an electrical low pressure impactor ELPI+. Assessment of the influence of meteorological parameters and various sources of contamination (transportation, industry, and residential burning) in heavily environmentally-burdened urban areas was attempted. This study proved that (K)(+) is related to metallurgical processes and its role as an indicator of biomass combustion is negligible. The highest concentrations of all water-soluble ions were determined in particles below 0.952 mu m that is generally related to combustion processes. At increased air temperature (in the interval from 0 degrees C to 10 degrees C), concentrations of both dust particles and the sum of water-soluble ions are decreasing.

AB  - The beaches, besides being a tourist recreation center, contain a large amount of microscopic biome with different species. Most pathogens are present in the sand, causing a high probability of human-parasite infection, especially by direct contact and poor hygienic habits. Likewise, the close bond that exists between animals and humans creates an environment conducive to the emergence of zoonoses of importance in public health, especially those related to companion animals such as dogs and cats. The monitoring usually carried out on tourist beaches includes as indicators of sanitary quality, total coliforms, fecal coliforms and in some cases enterococci, excluding the search for parasites as part of the parameters that define the sanitary status of the beaches. Consequently, the results do not fully reflect the environmental conditions of the beaches and the risk of affecting human health. In this review, forty-two articles (42) from Latin America were analyzed, as well as specialized literature from Europe and the United States, in which arguments are presented that support the permanent inclusion of parasites as indicators of health quality such as Ancylostoma sp., Strongyloides sp. and Taxocara sp., demonstrating the importance of their determination, main indicator species, laboratory techniques for their isolation and recent studies related to the topic.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recommended the use of aerobic spores as an indicator for Cryptosporidium oocysts when determining groundwater under the direct influence of surface water. Surface properties, interaction energies, transport, retention, and release behavior of B. subtilis spores were measured over a range of physicochemical conditions, and compared with reported information for C. parvum oocysts. Interaction energy calculations predicted a much larger energy barrier and a shallower secondary minimum for spores than oocysts when the solution ionic strength (IS) equaled 0.1, 1, and 10 mM, and no energy barrier when the IS = 100 mM. Spores and oocysts exhibited similar trends of increasing retention with IS and decreasing Darcy water velocity (q(w)), and the predicted setback distance to achieve a six log removal was always larger for spores than oocysts. However, low levels of observed spore and oocyst release significantly influenced the predicted setback distance, especially when the fraction of reversibly retained microbes (F-rev) was high. An estimate for F-rev was obtained from large release pulses of spore and oocyst when the IS was reduced to deionized water. The value of F-rev always increased with q(w), whereas an opposition trend for F-rev with IS was observed for spores (decreasing) and oocysts (increasing).

AB  - Comparatively little work has been done in the United States to develop multidimensional measures of child deprivation using individual level data. Our research, using Panel Study of Income Dynamics/Child Development Supplement data for a sample of older children and adolescents, introduces an experimental measure to demonstrate the new insights in child well-being that can be gained by looking beyond family income. Besides low income, our measure includes 16 indicators of deprivation encompassing child, parental, familial, and environmental conditions associated with poor outcomes in childhood and adulthood. We describe the surprisingly high incidence of deprivation among the sample children and examine differences by demographic characteristics. We calculate correlations among low income and other indicators of deprivation to understand how children are likely to be exposed to multiple deprivations. Using multivariate modeling, we examine the joint association of income and non-income contextual indicators with three child outcome deprivations: poor health, low social/emotional well-being, and poor basic learning skills. We find that the multidimensional measure provides valuable information about children at risk for poor development outcomes not captured by more standard income poverty and material hardship measures. The paper concludes with suggestions for public policy initiatives that may help reduce child exposure to these risk factors and ameliorate their effects.

AB  - Bacteriocins are natural compounds used as food biopreservatives instead of chemical preservatives. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (Bifid. lactis) was shown to produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) able to inhibit the growth of Listeria monocytogenes selected as an indicator microorganism. To enhance this production by the strain Bifid. lactis BL 04, skim milk (SM) was used as a fermentation medium either in the presence or in the absence of yeast extract, Tween 80 or inulin as stimulating additives, and the results in terms of bacterial growth and BLIS production were compared with those obtained in a traditional high cost complex medium such as Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS). To this purpose, all the cultivations were carried out in flasks at 200 rpm under anaerobic conditions ensured by a nitrogen flowrate of 1.0 L/min for 48 h, and BLIS production was quantified by means of a modified agar diffusion assay at low values of both temperature and concentration of List. monocytogenes. Although all these ingredients were shown to exert positive influence on BLIS production in both media, yeast extract and SM were by far the best ingredient and the best medium, respectively, allowing for a BLIS production at the late exponential phase of 2000 AU/ml.

AB  - Coastlines are an important land resource in the 21st century, the marine century. A scientific and reasonable assessment of coastline resources will benefit the formulation of coastal development strategy and increase the comprehensive use efficiency of coastline resources. The use of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) helped to establish the system of indicators for the comprehensive suitability assessment of coastline resources with emphasis on production, human life and ecological protection. Of the total continental coastline of Zhejiang, the coastline with top priority given to production accounted for 4.9%; the coastline with moderate development, 10.3%; the coastline for residence and tourism, 21.9%; the coastline under ecological protection, 1.5%; and the reserve coastline, 61.4%. The coastlines have good port construction conditions and are located at the junction zone coast section of Pinghu City and Haiyan City, the southern mouth of the Yongjiang River, Ningbo to the north bank of Beilun, the coast of Xiangshangang Bay. These coastline sections are suitable for priority development or moderate development. The coastline sections that are suitable for urbanization or tourism development are located east of Haiyan City and northwest of Cixi City. Part of the coastline sections in the east of Xiangshan County and in the middle of Sanmen County need to be strictly protected due to its unique ecological service value.

AB  - This work deals with mineral and diatom contents of the lower Eocene (Ypresian) phosphatic pellets of the Gafsa-Metlaoui basin, using XRD and SEM method. Since, mineral composition and fossil diatoms are best indicators of the depositional environments and diatom content leads to understand the role of diatoms in the formation of siliceous rocks especially porcelanite of the interbedded facies. This study indicates that phosphate minerals (fluorapatite) are associated with opal CT, carbonate mineral (dolomite and calcite), pyrite, sphalerite, and clinoptilolite. This association corroborates with deposition of the Ypresian sediments of the Gafsa-Metlaoui basin in alkaline and anoxic to suboxic marine environments under sulfate-reducing conditions. On the other hand, the exogangue is roughly free from diatoms except some highly dissolved diatom frustules. Endogangue displays some preserved diatom frustules, which allow the determination of three species: Paralia sulcata, Stephanopyxis sp. and Aulacoseira sp. Aulacoseira sp occurs at the eastern part of the Gafsa-Metlaoui basin (M'Zinda section) and it is known as a freshwater diatom. Stephanopyxis sp. and P. sulcata are both indicative of warm shallow marine water. They occur at Metlaoui Table and Kef Eddour sections, respectively.

AB  - Quantitative assessment of bacterial pathogens, their geographic variability, and distribution in various matrices at Great Lakes beaches are limited. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to test for genes from E. coli O157:H7 ((eae)O157), shiga-toxin producing E. coli (stx2), Campylobacter jejuni (mapA), Shigella spp. (ipaH), and a Salmonella enterica-specific (SE) DNA sequence at seven Great Lakes beaches, in algae, water, and sediment. Overall, detection frequencies were mapA>stx2>ipaH>SE>(eae)O157. Results were highly variable among beaches and matrices; some correlations with environmental conditions were observed for mapA, stx2, and ipaH detections. Beach seasonal mean mapA abundance in water was correlated with beach seasonal mean log10 E. coli concentration. At one beach, stx2 gene abundance was positively correlated with concurrent daily E. coli concentrations. Concentration distributions for stx2, ipaH, and mapA within algae, sediment, and water were statistically different (Non-Detect and Data Analysis in R). Assuming 10, 50, or 100% of gene copies represented viable and presumably infective cells, a quantitative microbial risk assessment tool developed by Michigan State University indicated a moderate probability of illness for Campylobacter jejuni at the study beaches, especially where recreational water quality criteria were exceeded. Pathogen gene quantification may be useful for beach water quality management.

AB  - This study comprehensively considered the climate, soil, terrain, and land-use type conditions suitable for Rosa damascena trigintipetala and further established an ecological suitability evaluation model of R. damascena trigintipetala in Sichuan Province, China, based on geographic information systems (GIS) and Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) models; then we assessed the different ecological suitability grades for this species in Sichuan Province of China and summarized the suitable land areas and spatial distribution pattern for R. damascena trigintipetala. The results show that the suitable areas (which contain highly suitable, generally suitable, and critically suitable areas) for R. damascena trigintipetala are 307.268x10(4) hm(2), which accounts for 6.34% of the total provincial area. Results also indicate that shrub land and open forest land are the major land-use types suitable for R. damascena trigintipetala, with the suitable areas of 303.162x10(4) hm(2) (6.25% of the total provincial area). An introduction test was conducted in one of the suitable areas, Xichang City, which demonstrated that R. damascena trigintipetala grows well at the experimental sites. The quality of rose oil extracted from R. damascena trigintipetala planted in Xichang meets the Bulgaria Rose Oil Standard, thus verifying the accuracy and reliability of the ecological suitability assessment results.

AB  - Palynofacies analysis of surface sediments from the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, was carried out to establish modern analogues for comparison with other Holocene marine records in southern Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Our results show the dominance of highly degraded translucent phytoclasts, associated with amorphous organic matter (AOM) and palynomorphs, while opaque phytoclasts are poorly represented. The organic constituents indicate the proximity of the continental source area to marine environments, with distances and/or times of relatively short transport. The predominance of translucent phytoclasts associated with pyrite suggests reducing conditions, probably associated with marginal-marine environments. Among the terrestrial palynomorph group, the predominance of Nothofagus pollen reveals the presence of forests along the channel. The high terrestrial organic matter input to the depositional area are consistent with a marginal-marine environment. The aquatic palynomorphs, mainly dinoflagellate cyst's show assemblages characterised by low species diversity and low concentration values. The dominance of Peridiniales over Gonyaulacales suggests inner neritic environments. Comparison with two fossil sections of Mid-Late Holocene age (Albufera Lanushuaia and Rio Ovando) shows similar distribution of the total palynological matter.

AB  - The study aimed to come up with a list of specific macroalgae species, which could be used to biomonitor specific metal elements in the coastal waters of East Africa. Water extraction, EDTA, aqua regia extraction and optimized BCR 3-step sequential extracts were used to mimic bioavailable metals under various environmental conditions. The results indicated that Ulva lactuca could be used as a biomonitor to predict BCR 3-step sequential bioavailable Al, Cd, Co, Fe, Mn, Zn and Ni whereas Sargassum species could be used as a biomonitor for BCR 3-step sequential bioavailable Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. In Sargassum spp. only Co showed significant correlation with concentration in sediment's aqua regia extracted metals whereas in Ulva lactuca only Al, Co, Cu and Fe showed significant correlation with total metals extracted through aqua regia procedure. This study therefore recommends the use of Ulva lactuca and Sargassum for biomonitoring of Al, Cd, Co, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni and Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn respectively. The study recommends the use of labile fraction of BCR sequential extraction for screening of macroalgae to be used for heavy metal pollution monitoring in East Africa region.

AB  - We conducted a series of experiments on granitoid cataclasites under mid-crustal conditions (Pc similar to 500 MPa, T=300 degrees C) and slow displacement rates (10(-8) ms(-1) < (d) over dot <10(-7) ms(-1)) i.e. within an order of magnitude of plate tectonic velocities. The samples reach high peak strength (1250 < tau < 1375 MPa) then weaken slightly (by similar to 40 MPa) and continue to deform without any abrupt stress drops up to a gamma of similar to 4. Microstructural observations show, that at peak strength nanocrystalline (mean grain size similar to 34 nm, smallest crystalline particles similar to 8 nm) to partly-amorphous material develops. Weakening occurs once this material is abundant enough to form through going anastomozing slip zones where the strain partitions. During higher strain deformation, deformation localizes further and 1 to 2 multiply connected layers of fragment loaded amorphous material develop. This material shares many similarities with naturally occurring pseudotachylites, however was formed at velocities up to 8 orders of magnitude slower than those calculated for earthquakes (similar to 1 ms(-1)). We conclude that the use of pseudotachylites as indicators for paleoseismic events should be reconsidered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was aimed to the development of an integrated approach for the characterization of particulate matter (PM) pollution events in the South of Italy.
   PM10 and PM2.5 daily samples were collected from June to November 2008 at an urban background site located in Bari (Puglia Region, South of Italy). Meteorological data, particle size distributions and atmospheric dispersion conditions were also monitored in order to provide information concerning the different features of PM sources.
   The collected data allowed suggesting four indicators to characterize different PM10 exceedances. PM2.5/PM10 ratio, natural radioactivity, aerosol maps and back-trajectory analysis and particle distributions were considered in order to evaluate the contribution of local anthropogenic sources and to determine the different origins of intrusive air mass coming from long-range transport, such as African dust outbreaks and aerosol particles from Central and Eastern Europe. The obtained results were confirmed by applying principal component analysis to the number particle concentration dataset and by the chemical characterization of the samples (PM10 and PM2.5).
   The integrated approach for PM study suggested in this paper can be useful to support the air quality managers for the development of cost-effective control strategies and the application of more suitable risk management approaches.

AB  - Uplands have long been considered important 'barometers' for human-environment relationships. Five pollen sequences from the upper Aber Valley (Snowdonia), across an altitudinal gradient, reveal that human impacts have varied temporally on small spatial scales in the region. Woodland taxa persisted into the later Holocene at lower altitudes and sites located at higher altitude reveal a more open landscape history, possibly as a result of increased exposure limiting tree growth at high elevation. Continuous pastoral human land use is evident in the high upland (400 to >600 m AOD) landscape with evidence of clearing, burning and grazing indicators throughout the records covering the last similar to 6000 years, with increased activity apparent during the last 2000 years. There is no clear evidence to suggest that climate change (e. g. deteriorating climatic conditions from similar to 850 BC) resulted in land abandonment and it appears more likely that climatic shifts could have led to changes in human land management. The results demonstrate that pastoral land use varied at different altitudes across the Aber Valley upland, and have highlighted the value and potential of high/fine spatial sampling in providing insights into land use history and the mosaic of habitats that result.

AB  - The research was accomplished on a farm with industrial housing of sows and on a family agricultural farm where sows are freely housed, outdoors. Twenty breeding sows from each farm were studied in this research.
   The experiment was conducted aiming to compare housing of sows, as well as those factors affecting stress indicators.
   For this purpose cortisol level was determined five days before farrowing, five days after farrowing and a day after weaning. Besides cortisol, other haematological parameters were determined in the blood, also.
   Statistically significant higher concentration of cortisol was determined at five days before farrowing in sows housed freely compared to sows housed industrially (p < 0.05).
   Five days after farrowing and a day after weaning, concentrations of cortisol were lower in the blood of freely housed sows compared to industrially housed sows. However, the difference was not significant.
   The level of cortisol determined in sows housed freely during pregnancy, and after dislocation into wedged farrowing departments, five days before farrowing, was significantly higher than in industrial sows. The aforesaid confirmed stress that can be induced by relocating the sows to a new location and wedged space.
   The level of cortisol, determined in industrial sows was almost of equal values during the whole research, the fact being related to constant stress conditions.

AB  - The invasion and expansion of the non-native Phragmites australis in Great Lakes coastal wetlands is of increasing concern, but quantitative studies of the extent, rate, and causes of invasion have been lacking. Here we revisited 307 plots in 14 wetlands along the Great Lakes coast in 2005 that had previously been sampled for vegetation in 2001-2003. During the 2-4 years between sample events, Phragmites occurred in 101 plots. Genetic analysis revealed that none of the Phragmites samples collected at the 14 wetlands belonged to the native genotype. Decreases in water depth and bare soil area were associated with the greatest increases in Phragmites cover. Phragmites invasion was greater on Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie than it was on Lake Ontario, and occurred predominantly on sandy substrates. Soil water concentrations of NO(3)-N, NH(3)-N, and soluble reactive P did not differ significantly between plots with and without Phragmites. Monitoring coastal wetlands where water level has dropped and controlling Phragmites at early stages of invasion are essential for maintaining healthy Great Lakes coastal wetlands of high species diversity and wildlife habitat. This becomes important as water levels in the Great Lakes have reached extreme lows and are expected to decline with future climate change.

AB  - In this study postglacial continuous high-resolution data from five marine sediment cores from Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait are presented. Up to now studies in this area focused on the distinction between large scale climatic variations like the glacial-postglacial transition or most recent processes. However, as demonstrated in this study, using sedimentological, geochemical and geophysical parameters, postglacial sediments provide provenance signals distinguishing between Proterozoic Dubawnt Group sediments, Paleozoic limestone sources underlying parts of Hudson Bay and Strait and Precambrian granitoids from the Canadian Shield. For example it is shown that redistribution of Dubawnt Group sediments is of minor importance after the outburst flood of Lake Agassiz. Paleoproductivity indicators also give insights into paleotemperature trends. These are in phase with terrestrial reconstructions from that area. Colder conditions in Hudson Strait until ca. 4500 cal BP followed by a signal of warmth until ca. 4000 cal BP are suggested. Subsequently, a cool interval lasting until approximately 2000 cal BP occurred. Thereafter, a gradual decrease in temperature was observed reaching lowest values during the Little Ice Age period and increasing again afterwards. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is far more important how the cogeneration units are operated than whether they represent the latest technology progress or not. Therefore, for the management of cogeneration units it is a key issue to find optimal operating conditions bringing in the largest income. This may be achieved by combined marginal and overall performance criteria application. To prove this statement, two cogeneration units operating in the Slovak Republic, marked as A and B, were examined. Both of them use the liberal market environment and participate in provisioning ancillary services. Marginal profit values without and with ancillary services provisioning clearly indicate the most advantageous base load value, which is in both cases in the middle of the load regulation range. As shown, together with the total profit function, they are very suitable indicators of the optimal load location and a flexible tool for the market situation evaluation. Heat delivery capability of B to customers reaches its maximum at the middle of the load regulation range, again reinforcing the optimal part load operation. Being equipped with supplementary firing, the marginal steam production of B was found to be higher than 100 % which confirms that the rules for marginal quantities values are not as strict as those for overall and specific quantities.

AB  - We investigated the use of maize pollen as food by adult Chrysoperla carnea under laboratory and field conditions. Exposure of the insects to insecticidal Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) contained in pollen of transgenic maize was also assessed. Female C. carnea were most abundant in a maize field when the majority of plants were flowering and fresh pollen was abundant. Field-collected females contained an average of approximately 5000 maize pollen grains in their gut at the peak of pollen shedding. Comparable numbers were found in females fed ad libitum maize pollen in the laboratory. Maize pollen is readily used by C. carnea adults. When provided with a carbohydrate source, it allowed the insects to reach their full reproductive potential. Maize pollen was digested mainly in the insect's mid- and hindgut. When Bt maize pollen passed though the gut of C. carnea, 61% of Cry1Ab (event Bt176) and 79% of Cry3Bb1 (event MON 88017) was digested. The results demonstrate that maize pollen is a suitable food source for C. carnea. Even though the pollen grains are not fully digested, the insects are exposed to transgenic insecticidal proteins that are contained in the pollen. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive approach with factors to select appropriate wastewater treatment systems in developing countries in general and Thailand in particular. Instead of focusing merely on the technical dimensions, the study integrates the social, economic, and environmental concerns to develop a set of criteria and indicators (C&I) useful for evaluating appropriate system alternatives. The paper identifies seven elements crucial for technical selection: reliability, simplicity, efficiency, land requirement, affordability, social acceptability, and sustainability. Variables are organized into three hierarchical elements, namely: principles, criteria, and indicators. The study utilizes a mail survey to obtain information from Thai experts-academicians, practitioners, and government officials-to evaluate the C&I list. Responses were received from 33 experts on two multi-criteria analysis inquiries-ranking and rating-to obtain evaluative judgments. Results show that reliability, affordability, and efficiency are among the most important elements, followed by sustainability and social acceptability. Land requirement and simplicity are low in priority with relatively inferior weighting. A number of criteria are then developed to match the contextual environment of each particular condition. A total of 14 criteria are identified which comprised 64 indicators. Unimportant criteria and indicators are discarded after careful consideration, since some of the indicators are local or site specific.

AB  - Effects of high water levels on the abundance of colony-forming units of eutrophic and oligotrophic bacteria were investigated. Changes in their proportion were exploited as the biological indicator of organic substrate availability. It was also reconsidered, to a certain extent, which source (autochtonous or allochtonous) of organic substrate and bacteria prevails during floods. Water samples were collected from the surface and from the bottom during high water levels in the floodplain lake (Kopacko Lake) and the connecting channel (Hulovo Channel). The relative abundance of oligotrophs vs. eutrophs was considerably higher at the end of investigation, to which higher abundance of eutrophs preceded at Kopaeko Lake sampling station. Also in Kopaeko Lake, a considerably higher abundance of bacteria was noticed in the bottom samples during first intensive flooding pulses. Elevated bacterial abundance was connected with the sufficiently intensive floods (eutrophs dominate) but also with the water properties established following the settling down of disturbed conditions (oligotrophs dominate). Greater abundance in the bottom samples established during the first intensive pulse suggests a sediment origin of bacteria, while considerable differentiation between oligotrophic and eutrophic bacteria suggests an establishment of lower quality of organic substrate at the end of the investigation.

AB  - [1] The Puna-Altiplano plateau in South America is a high-elevation, low internal relief landform that is characterized by internal drainage and hyperaridity. Thermochronologic and sedimentologic observations from the Sierra de Calalaste region in the southwestern Puna plateau, Argentina, place new constraints on early plateau evolution by resolving the timing of uplift of mountain ranges that bound present-day basins and the filling pattern of these basins during late Eocene-Miocene time. Paleocurrent indicators, sedimentary provenance analyses, and apatite fission track thermochronology indicate that the original paleodrainage setting was disrupted by exhumation and uplift of the Sierra de Calalaste range between 24 and 29 Ma. This event was responsible for basin reorganization and the disruption of the regional fluvial system that has ultimately led to the formation of internal drainage conditions, which, in the Salar de Antofalla, were established not later than late Miocene. Upper Eocene-Oligocene sedimentary rocks flanking the range contain features that suggest an arid environment existed prior to and during its uplift. Provenance data indicate a common similar source located to the west for both the southern Puna and the Altiplano of Bolivia during the late Eocene-Oligocene with sporadic local sources. This suggests the existence of an extensive, longitudinally oriented foreland basin along the central Andes during this time.

AB  - Tephra beds that are well drained and have been buried by thin paleosols become hydrated within 2-3000 yr on reaction with meteoric waters. Hence, the absorbed water within silicic volcanic glass shards provides a potential record of deltaD values of ancient meteoric water. Such isotopic records have previously received little investigation. We demonstrate that 1.5-2 in thick tephra beds in central North Island, New Zealand, display uniform deltaD values vertically through their profiles and laterally up to 250 in in outcrop. Reproducibility is not influenced by grain size or age of the tephra. We obtained an average deltaD value of -48 +/- 3parts per thousand for water within the 1.8 ka Taupo Tephra. This is similar to the composition of present-day surface waters. deltaD values of -73 +/-2 and -60 +/- 2parts per thousand for the 25 ka Kawakawa and 30 ka Mangaone Tephra beds are significantly lower than present waters, indicating that they have been hydrated under different surficial conditions. This is consistent with other proxy paleoclimatic indicators that suggest a cooler, drier, and windier climate at the time of their eruption. Tephra beds are a potential source of paleoclimatic data in terrestrial environments that otherwise may lack proxy records.

AB  - We examine temporal variation in measures of developmental stability, such as the degree of fluctuating asymmetry and the number of phenotypic deviants per individual, in three populations of the common shrew Sorex araneus L. by using several characters of skeletal morphology.  We compare a population from central Siberia with a high-amplitude 4-yr cycle with a population from southern Finland with noncyclic dynamics.  The level of developmental stability varies significantly among the years in both populations.  In the cyclic population in Siberia, developmental stability is highly correlated with population density, suggesting that in this case high density (or something related to it) is the most important negative factor affecting breeding females.  In the noncyclic population in southern Finland we find no correlation between developmental stability and density.  In both cyclic and noncyclic populations, developmental stability correlates positively with breeding success, indicating that breeding success is affected by the physiological condition of breeding females.  Another relationship is found between developmental stability and natal dispersal (in eastern Finland), the rate of natal dispersal being highest when developmental stability is lowest.  Developmental stability may be used as another population parameter, providing integrated information on the various factors that may adversely affect breeding females in natural populations.

AB  - In this study, Life Cycle Assessment upon the production chain of an encapsulated olive leaves' extract (enzymatically modified) has been applied. The chain consists of eleven processes - from the acquisition of raw material up to the production of the powder. This study's primary goal was not only to examine the overall final environmental footprint, but also, to compare two different extraction techniques, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and solid-liquid extraction (SLE), in relation to their contribution to this environmental footprint. In addition, the effect of alternative conditions of these techniques was evaluated. "Hotspot" processes were detected. Literature, Gabi is database, and Aspen simulations were the sources utilized for data acquisition. The assessment of all available impact categories for the examined scenarios was performed. According to the results, (a) all impact indicators for each scenario were low, encouraging such a product's production; (b) the extraction yield emerged as an important parameter, defining the overall environmental footprint; (c) SLE with ethanol as solvent led to the lowest environmental footprint, encouraging, e.g., its selection in the mass production; (d) SFE technique (with cosolvent, preferably) remains a viable option for industry; and (e) Increase of yield of SFE with cosolvent technique leads to a decrease of the overall environmental footprint.

AB  - Exploring how urban form affects the Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) concentration could help to find environmentally friendly urbanization. According to the definition of geography, this paper constructs a comprehensive urban form evaluation index system applicable to many aspects. Four urban form metrics, as well as road density and five control variables are selected. Based on 2015 data on China's 340 prefecture-level cities, the spatial regression model and geographically weighted regression model were used to explore the relationship between the urban form evaluation index system and PM2.5 pollution. The main results show that the spatial distribution of PM2.5 in China follows an increasing trend from northwest to southeast. Urban form indicators such as AI, LPI, PLAND, LSI and road density were all significantly related to PM2.5 concentrations. More compact urban construction, lower fragmentation of urban land, and lower density of the road network are conducive factors for improving air quality conditions. In addition, affected by seasonal changes, the correlation between urban form and PM2.5 concentration in spring and winter is higher than that in summer and winter. This study confirmed that a reasonable urban planning strategies are very important for improving air quality.

AB  - Objectives Natural borneol and synthetic borneol were commonly used to treat ischaemic stroke in clinical practice. This study evaluated their different neuroprotective effects on the remodelling and repair of the neurovascular unit (NVU) after cerebral ischaemia. Methods We evaluated the different effects of borneol through neurological test and staining methods in cerebral ischaemia injury. Western blot, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the reparative effects of borneol on NVU. Key findings The prevention and treatment of borneol could prolong recovery time, reduce body temperature and cerebral infarction rate and improve pathological conditions. Further investigations revealed that borneol could inhibit the expression of DII4, Hes1, Hes5 and p65 and increase the Nissl body number and microvessel density. They also inhibited the activation of the microglia. It was also observed through an ultramicroelectron microscope that the structural stability of the NVU has also been repaired. Moreover, natural borneol shows better results in most indicators when compared with synthetic borneol. Conclusions Natural borneol showed a stronger effectiveness and had better regulation and neuroprotection on the NVU when compared with synthetic borneol, indicating that it may be better to use natural borneol in the prescription of Chinese patent medicine in clinical practice.

AB  - The oily sludge with high water content (OS) was dewatered, modified, and converted into solid fuel by a novel chemical conditioner (OSO-101). The effect of OSO-101 dosage on the dewaterability of OS was studied, showing that OSO-101 dosage of 15% (wt.) could achieve the best dewaterability efficiency of OS (98.18%). Meanwhile, compared with some conventional conditioners, OSO-101 developed by our team was more effective in improving OS dewaterability efficiency. And OSO-101 may have free radical reaction, polar reaction, and redox reaction with petroleum hydrocarbons in OS, thereby polymerizing and forming condensed solid structures. The calorific value change of OS after conditioning, heavy metal content, and dioxin content of fly ash leached from incinerated product were measured for resource analysis and environmental assessment. Results showed that the resultant OS fuel blocks had extremely low content of heavy metals, dioxins, and other toxic and hazardous substances leached from fly ash. And this process did not require secondary treatment and fully met environmental protection emission standards. Additionally, OSO-101 had certain economic rationality and could effectively recover the calorific value contained in OS. This research is expected to provide new insights for efficient dewaterability and modification of OS, as well as subsequent resource utilization and harmless treatment, bringing potential environmental and economic benefits.

AB  - Stormwater biofiltration systems (SBS) are a popular technology for mitigating the negative effects of urbanization on the hydrological processes and water quality in urban areas. However, little is known about SBS's longterm performance in actual field conditions. The findings of a review of the scientific literature on the long-term performance of SBS are presented in this paper. The findings show that only a few studies have investigated the performance of SBS and its change over time, and that the results of laboratory and field experiments differed due to the presence of plants, regular maintenance, and some uncertain environmental factors. Based on the existing knowledge gaps in this field, the main challenges observed was the lack of long-term field data series, and the existing mathematical models are not able to accurately forecast the long-term performance of SBS. This could be owing to the difficulties in monitoring activities, the high costs involved and the unpredictability around the operational timeframe. Future study should concentrate on the implementation of simulation and modeling-based research in pilot and full-scale SBS, and the inclusion of new performance indicators should be considered as a priority.

AB  - Aquaculture of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis in the Gulf of Maine is a growing industry at a time when wild mussel populations are threatened by a rapidly changing ocean. Intertidal mussel beds have largely disappeared in the region raising concerns over the long-term viability of mussel farming. Histology and lipid fatty acid analysis were used to assess gametogenesis, energy investment, and pathology of farmed mussels collected twice monthly for three years in Casco Bay, ME. Energy investment in reproduction and storage differed significantly between years, suggesting interannual variability. Wet weight of fatty acids such as DHA and EPA corresponded to pre-spawning periods, when gonad tissue was most abundant. Overall, pathology assessment showed low levels of common pathogens, parasites, and cellular abnormalities. The survey did, however, reveal high levels of oocyte atresia, a probable indicator of physiological or environmental stress from unfavorable spawning conditions. In addition, the presence of the potentially damaging digenetic trematode Proctoeces maculatus was documented using histology, marking the northernmost detection in the Northwest Atlantic and a likely climate-driven range expansion. These trends may signal a challenging future for blue mussels in the Gulf of Maine. Forward-looking farm mitigation practices informed by these results should be developed to ensure future sustainability of this industry.

AB  - The built environment is continuously changing, and so is the socio- cultural scenario because of the rapid urbanization and technological developments. Researchers and thinkers have been working toward conserving the resources and finally came up with sustainable development. The concept can be interpreted in three spheres; social, economic, and environmental. The indicators of social sustainability are often neglected. This negligence causes a rise to serious issues like lack of identity, belongingness, improper land use, unhygienic conditions, increased stress level, and unsafe society. This research paper aims at analyzing the indicators of social sustainability and urban design elements, thereby exploring the priorities amongst them in the present context. This study applies qualitative and quantitative methods to collect information from different sections of Indian society. The study highlights that urban design elements have a positive impact on social well-being. The elements are architectural elements and the driving element that make a community strong and more livable, which is the ultimate sustainable development target. However, the study also identifies certain indicators, which seem to be neglected, and suggests some recommendations based on exploratory research. (C) 2021 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

AB  - The cone index (CI), as an indicator of the soil strength, is closely related to the traction performance of tractors. This study evaluates the traction performance of a tractor in terms of the CI during tillage. To analyze the traction performance, a field site was selected and divided into grids, and the CI values at each grid were measured. The CI maps of the field sites were created using the measured CI. The traction performance was analyzed using the measured traction load. The traction performance was grouped at CI intervals of 400 kPa to classify it in terms of the Cl. When the CI decreased, the engine speed and tractive efficiency (TE) decreased, while the engine torque, slip ratio, axle torque, traction force, and dynamic traction ratio (DTR) increased. Moreover, the DTR increased up to approximately 13%, and the TE decreased up to 9%. The maximum TE in the DTR range of 0.45-0.55 was higher than approximately 80% for CI values above 1500 kPa. The DTR and TE results obtained in terms of the CI can help efficiently design tractors considering the soil environmental conditions. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ISTVS.

AB  - Purpose The objective of this article is to examine the extent to which the antecedents of entrepreneurial employee activity differ by gender across countries. Design/methodology/approach Generalised linear multilevel logistic regression is applied to data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) with a sample of 60 countries for the period 2014-2016. This data is complemented with data from the World Governance Indicators (WGI) project and from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Findings Using human capital theory (for individual-related antecedents) and institutional economics (for environmental related antecedents), the results show that the antecedents of entrepreneurial employee activity differ by gender. Specifically, being in contact with other entrepreneurs, and the quality of government regulations condition entrepreneurial employee activity and have a different intensity depending on gender. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature about entrepreneurial initiatives and gender by providing insights that add to the literature on why men and women have different entrepreneurial behaviours. In addition, this study also contributes to human capital theory and institutional economics as their role in the relation between entrepreneurial employee activity and gender has not been studied in detail in previous research. Finally, the promotion of female intrapreneurial activity is a key policy for most public bodies and organisations in developed countries.

AB  - Effective use of waste heat at low and medium temperatures is considered as one of the solutions to alleviate energy shortages and environmental pollution problems. Due to its feasibility and reliability, the organic Rankine cycle is continued to attract widespread interest from researchers and/or manufacturers. This paper presents thermodynamic and economic analyses on flue-gas assisted organic Rankine cycles (FGA-ORCs) based on both energy and exergy concepts. The heat source of the FGA-ORC system is the exhaust flue-gas of a stenter-frame which is highly used in textile finishing process. In this study, to convert thermal energy into electrical and/or mechanical energy on a small scale, an optimization study was performed using five different cycle architectures. Parametric studies were also carried out to investigate the effect of operating parameters on performance indicators such as efficiency, economical profit and performance ratio. Finally, under specified operating conditions, the thermal architecture was identified that reduces exergy destruction and increases economic profit due to increased net-work output. For analyzed cases in this study, Scenario-4 (i.e., thermal architecture 4) shows the best system performance with 69% exergetic efficiency within the thermodynamic and practical limits.

AB  - The study of the Quaternary sediments of the Kordofan region, Sudan, allowed to decipher the succession of environments in this area, since about 13 kyr. The oldest sediments ( > 13 to 10.5 kyr BP) are mainly aeolian deposits, except in the southern areas. The "African Humid Period" is recorded by scattered palustrine and lacustrine carbonates dated at 10.5-6.5 kyr BP in the center and North, respectively, by fluvial deposits in the South, and by the pedogenesis of previous deposits in all areas. Fluvial activity may be responsible for the erosion of the previous aeolian sands in the southern areas. Between 6.5 and 3.3 kyr BP, the evolution from aquatic to terrestrial gastropod fauna, and from tropical to arid pollen assemblages points to the shift toward an arid climate. This aridification phase culminated between 3.3 and 1.1 kyr BP, with a period of strong aeolian activity and erosion. Aeolian deposition resumed after 1.1 kyr BP under conditions comparable to those of today. This evolution is consistent with that recorded in Saharan areas, although the period of strong aeolian erosion (approximate to 3.3-1.1 kyr BP) may have been underestimated so far.

AB  - The construction industry has already begun the transition to circular economy and intensive research has been conducted over the last decades at laboratory scale to assess the potential use of waste in ceramic applications. However, industrial trials to prove its scale up have been performed to a lesser extent. This work studies the effect of trial scale on the technological and environmental properties of high quality ceramic products incorporating Waelz slag (WS), an industrial by-product from the recovery of electric arc furnace dust. To this aim, three groups of ceramics have been produced varying the WS content and the process parameters, moulding water and pressure, at laboratory and industrial scale. Preliminary laboratory scale tests were used to optimize WS content and process conditions using the software GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System). Optimum ceramic products were processed at both laboratory and industrial scale and tested for their technological and environmental properties. Results from the laboratory and industrial trials were compared to evaluate the scale effect on the ceramic properties. The introduction of WS in clay bricks seems to be easily scaled-up for additions of WS <= 10wt%, but higher percentages of WS promotes relevant differences in the properties of the laboratory and industrial bricks.

AB  - This article analyzes the economic efficiency of waste management companies with the aim of verifying the existence of scale economies with respect to separate waste collection preceding reuse, recycling, and recovery. For this purpose, an approach based on partial elasticity is used for a group of companies providing waste management services throughout Italy. Results show that the greater the separate waste collection rate, the higher the total costs incurred by the analyzed companies; this relationship is non-linear since a rise in the separate waste collection rate increases total costs less than proportionally, which gives evidence for the existence of scale economies. The findings also reveal that such a cost advantage is strengthened by a positive interaction effect with population density. These results show that a significant increase in separate waste collection rate could be realized in an efficient way and, thus, without jeopardizing companies' economic sustainability, which is essential to continue ensuring such important services for the community. One of the main implications of these results concerns policy makers: considering the population density impact, working in certain territories can be more economically convenient for companies; thus, policy makers should support those firms that could be penalized by the contextual conditions.

AB  - Understanding how plants allocate biomass to different organs is of high importance since biomass allocation among organs determines many growth processes. Biomass allocation among plant organs is driven by environmental conditions, while functional traits can also be potential covariates to understand the allocation of biomass. However, the relationships between functional traits and biomass allocation remain poorly known and studied. We investigated the relationships of two biomass allocation indicators, including leaf mass fraction (LMF) and leaf area ratio (LAR), with six economic traits and five hydraulic traits across 30 woody species. We found that LMF and LAR showed different relationships with economics traits. In addition, a significantly negative correlation was observed between LMF and leaf water potential at turgor loss point (TLP), but no significant relationship was found between LAR and TLP. Principal component analyses showed that LMF-related traits and LAR-related traits could be divided into two groups. Taken together, LMF is mainly related to draught tolerance while LAR mainly related to light capture. Although LMF and LAR are two significantly correlated biomass allocation indicators, they play different roles in the acclimation of plants. Researchers should focus on the different functions of these two indicators and the different relationships with other functional traits in the further research.

AB  - Earlier geological works showed that Cod6 Formation - CF (Parnaiba Basin, Brazil) has been deposited in the Aptian, and suffered the influence of various transgressive-regressive marine cycles, thus suggesting various depositional environment possibilities from saline lacustrine deltaic to shallow marine during sedimentation. Cretaceous potential source rock samples from the CF were investigated to identify diagnostic biomarkers in order to ascertain paleoenvironmental conditions of deposition and thermal evolution of organic matter. The TOC results showed low organic matter (OM) contents and Rock-Eval analysis implying low thermal evolution of organic matter. GC-MS analysis showed a great diversity of biomarkers within the five studied samples. The main features of organic matter composition were: low content of n-alkanes, Ph >> Pr, presence of i-25, i-30 (squalane) and gammacerane thus suggesting saline to hypersaline depositional environment. The biomarkers fingerprint showed a full series of beta beta hopanes and Delta(13(18)) hopenes, alpha alpha alpha R and beta alpha alpha R steranes, and Delta(5) and Delta(8(14)) sterenes, pointing out immature OM. Several C-30 steranes have been detected, among them 4 alpha(methyl)- and 4 beta(methyl)-24-ethylcholestane, 24-n-propylcholestane and 24-isopropylcholestane (all identified by co-injection) and dinosteranes, which some of them are indicative of a marine depositional system.

AB  - We carried out surveys to clarify how the density (no. of individuals/m(2)) and condition factor (CF) of Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum differ between estuarine tidal flats and shingle beaches in the Bisan-Seto Strait, Seto Inland Sea, Japan. The density of Manila clams in estuarine tidal flats has been decreasing since around 2008. In contrast, Manila clams are found at considerably higher densities in some shingle beaches. Moreover, the CFs for clams inhabiting the shingle beaches are higher than those for clams inhabiting the tidal flats, indicating that shingle beaches provide a more suitable environment for Manila clams than tidal flats. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the bottom layer of seawater, used as an indicator of the amount of food available to clams, were similar in both habitats. The seawater temperature, and mud temperature, at low tide in summer were 4-6 degrees C higher for the tidal flat than for the shingle beach. The maximum seawater and mud temperatures for the tidal flats reached 34.1 degrees C and 35.4 degrees C, respectively, showing that Manila clams inhabiting these areas are exposed to critically high temperatures. These results indicate that shingle beaches are an important habitat for Manila clams.

AB  - Mining is one of the key industries in the world and mine water pollution is a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems. Historical monitoring data on the pollution history and impacts in aquatic ecosystems, however, are rarely available, so paleolimnological methods are required to explore the consequences of past pollution. We studied the history of cladoceran community dynamics in Lake Kirkkojarvi, southern Finland, including the periods before, during and after mining. We analyzed the geochemical composition and cladoceran subfossil remains in a Pb-210-dated sediment core to evaluate the magnitude, rate, and direction of cladoceran community changes through time. The cladoceran community was altered significantly by mining activity that occurred during the mid-twentieth century. During more recent times, however, eutrophication effects have overridden the impacts of mining. After mining ceased, the cladoceran community underwent an abrupt regime shift towards taxa that reflect more eutrophic conditions. This change was caused by intensive farming activity and fertilizer use over the past few decades. The recent history of Lake Kirkkojarvi is a textbook example of a regime shift triggered by multiple human-caused stressors. Our findings also highlight the utility of cladocerans as bio-indicators in pollution research and illustrate the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to anthropogenic modification.

AB  - The pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Dennis and Schiff.), one of the major defoliating insects in Mediterranean forests, has become an increasing threat to the forest health of the region over the past two decades. After a recent outbreak of T. pityocampa in Catalonia, Spain, we attempted to estimate the damage severity by capturing the maximum defoliation period over winter between pre-outbreak and post-outbreak images. The difference in vegetation index (dVI) derived from Landsat 8 was used as the change detection indicator and was further calibrated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. Regression models between predicted dVIs and observed defoliation degrees by UAV were compared among five selected dVIs for the coefficient of determination. Our results found the highest R-squared value (0.815) using Moisture Stress Index (MSI), with an overall accuracy of 72%, as a promising approach for estimating the severity of defoliation in affected areas where ground-truth data is limited. We concluded with the high potential of using UAVs as an alternative method to obtain ground-truth data for cost-effectively monitoring forest health. In future studies, combining UAV images with satellite data may be considered to validate model predictions of the forest condition for developing ecosystem service tools.

AB  - A species sensitivity distribution (SSD) for engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) ranks the tested species according to their sensitivity to a certain ENM. An SSD may be used to estimate the maximum acceptable concentrations of ENMs for the purpose of environmental risk assessment. To construct SSDs for metal based ENM5, more than 1800 laboratory derived toxicity records of metallic ENMs from >300 publications or open access scientific reports were retrieved. SSDs were developed for the metallic ENMs grouped by surface coating, size, shape, exposure duration, light exposure, and different toxicity endpoints. It was found that PVP- and sodium citrate- coatings enhance the toxicity of Ag ENM5 as concluded from the relevant SSDs. For the Ag ENMs with different size ranges, differences in behavior and/or effect were only observed at high exposure concentrations. The SSDs of Ag ENM5 separated by both shape and exposure duration were all nearly identical. Crustaceans were found to be the most vulnerable group to metallic ENMs. In spite of the uncertainties of the results caused by limited data quality and availability, the present study provided novel information about building SSDs for distinguished ENMs and contributes to the further development of SSDs for metal-based ENM5.

AB  - In almonds, there is no standard method for detecting oxidative changes and little data correlating consumer perception with chemical markers of rancidity. To address this, we measured peroxide values (PV), free fatty acid values (FFAs), conjugated dienes, tocopherols, headspace volatiles, and consumer hedonic response in light roasted (LR) and dark roasted (DR) almonds stored under conditions that promote rancidity development over 12 months. Results demonstrate that, although rancidity develops at different rates in LR and DR almonds, consumer liking was not significantly different between LR and DR almonds. Average hedonic ratings of almonds were found to fall below a designated acceptable score of 5 ("neither like nor dislike") by 6 months of storage. This did not correspond with recommended industry rejection standard of PV < 5 mequiv peroxide/kg oil and FFA < 1.5% oleic. FFAs remain well below < 1.5% oleic during storage, indicating that FFAs are not a good marker of rancidity in roasted almonds stored in low humidity environments. Regression of consumer liking to concentration of rancidity indicators revealed that selected headspace volatiles, including heptanal, octanal, nonanal, 2-octenal, 2-heptanone, 2pentylfuran, hexanal, and pentanal, had a better correlation with liking than did nonvolatile indicators.

AB  - Background: Carbon dioxide overdose is frequently used to cull rodents for tissue harvesting. However, this treatment may lead to respiratory acidosis, which potentially could change the properties of the investigated tissue.
   New method: Mechanical tissue properties often change in pathological conditions and may thus offer a sensitive generic readout for changes in biological tissues with clinical relevance. In this study, we performed force-indentation measurements with an atomic force microscope on acute cerebellar slices from adult rats to test if brain tissue undergoes changes following overexposure to CO2 compared to other methods of euthanasia.
   Results: The pH significantly decreased in brain tissue of animals exposed to CO2. Concomitant with the drop in pH, cerebellar grey matter significantly stiffened. Tissue stiffening was reproduced by incubation of acute cerebellar slices in acidic medium.
   Comparison with existing methods: Tissue stiffness provides an early, generic indicator for pathophysiological changes in the CNS. Atomic force microscopy offers unprecedented high spatial resolution to detect such changes.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the stiffness particularly of grey matter strongly correlates with changes of the pH in the cerebellum. Furthermore, the method of tissue harvesting and preparation may not only change tissue stiffness but very likely also other physiologically relevant parameters, highlighting the importance of appropriate sample preparation.

TI  - At the Threshold of Representation: Cremation and Cremated Remains in Classical Latin Literature
T2  - CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY
LA  - English
KW  - HORACE
KW  - BODIES
AB  - This paper considers a set of passages from classical Latin literature of the first century BC and first century AD that indicate awareness of the particular transformations undergone by a human body during the process of open-air cremation. Evidence for the extent of cremation throughout the Roman West is reviewed, as are indications that mourners frequently remained near the pyre throughout the lengthy transformation of the corpse into bone-remnants and ash. In addition, archaeological, ethnographic, and forensic evidence documenting the step-by-step changes undergone by the burning body is introduced. Against this backdrop, numerous passages from authors such as Horace, Vergil, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Seneca, Lucan, Statius, and Suetonius take on new significance. Although authors occasionally cite crematory details as such, they more frequently make use of such details in non-crematory contexts in order to achieve a variety of literary and aesthetic goals, including economy of description, reflection on the circulation of substance, and clarification of the process of ekpyrosis, or cosmic conflagration. For these writers considered as a group cremation serves as an indicator of both the abject nature of the human condition and of its potential sublimity. The calculated displacement of key aspects of the crematory process onto non-crematory events and practices mirrors and extends the liminality associated with crematory rites.

AB  - The continuous expansion of impervious artificial surfaces in cities has significantly influenced the urban thermal environment. This paper examines the spatiotemporal variation of the diurnal surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Shanghai from 1989 to 2013, a period during which the city has experienced drastic development changes. A remote sensing approach was taken to derive the spatial patterns of Shanghai's land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The LST pattern was further classified into five LST classes to look at the relative SUHI intensity level across the whole city. Spatial analyses, namely, spatial association and centroid movement analysis, were conducted to reveal the trends of LST changes at both local and holistic scales. To understand the potential drivers for the present spatiotemporal variation of SUHI, different indicators including land use change, population density, night light data, and vegetation were analyzed and compared with LST changes. Based on the quantitative analysis and the socioeconomic context of Shanghai, "heating up" regions were identified, possible reasons for such SUHI variation were summarized, and districts that are most vulnerable to extreme heat conditions were projected. In terms of implication for urban development, planning and design recommendations were suggested to improve the urban thermal environment in Shanghai.

AB  - Inceptisols in the submountainous region of Indo-Gangetic Plains in India are known as low productive areas due to several constraints like decline in soil organic matter and fertility, deterioration of soil physical and biological properties. The present study was conducted with tillage as main treatments and integrated nutrient management as subtreatments to improve soil quality and to identify the key indicators of soil quality after 5years of experimentation in maize-wheat cropping system at Ballowal Saunkhri. Conventional tillage (CT)+interculture (IC) maintained significantly higher soil quality indices (SQI) of 1.12 which was at par with 50% CT+IC+chemical weed control (CWC) (1.08). Application of nitrogen (N) through 50% (organic)+50% (inorganic) maintained higher soil quality with SQI of 1.10 followed by application of 100% N through organics (1.08). The results indicated that reduction in the intensity of tillage to 50% with interculture practices and combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers maintained higher soil quality in these degraded Inceptisols. The methods of principal component analysis and computation of SQI adopted will be highly useful to future researchers, land managers, and students at locations across the world having similar climatic and edaphic conditions.

AB  - Biorefineries aim to convert low value biomasses into high value products. The feedstock biomasses are often high-silica agricultural waste products such as rice straw, wheat straw, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, or empty fruit bunches. This causes challenges, since silica is problematic in industrial processes, where it forms water-insoluble precipitates that are hard to remove, block filtration systems, and cause instrumental defects. In this paper we review various industries that experience issues with silica. These include paper pulping and waste-water treatment, where they try to solve their problems with silica in different ways. High pH and co-precipitation with mineral elements are some common ways of alleviating silica problems. Reviewing the literature for the fundamentals of silica revealed a complex chemistry that is not yet fully understood. Much is still to be learned about the interactions between silica and organic material as well as the mechanisms of silica precipitation and dissolution. Understanding the fundamental and complex chemistry of silica might help developing better solutions than those existing today, allowing efficient use of high silica biomasses in biorefineries.

AB  - Catch and effort data of the tuna purse seine fishery and biological and socio-economic parameters of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Eastern Pacific Ocean were used to reconstruct the population structure for 1995-2009. The fishing mortality in recent years indicates a growing pressure on the stock, but it was found slightly under exploited. By increasing the fishing mortality would allow attaining the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). The Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) can be achieved by reducing the fishing mortality rate. With a reduction of the fishing mortality in 20% per year, the stock could be restored and the benefit/cost ratio could increase allowing a sustainable fishery. Results of the simulations suggest that the best harvesting strategy to adopt would be at the MEY, which imply several benefits and a few inconvenient social and economic costs, which after a comparison with the current condition, seems to be quite acceptable. If adopted, it is convenient to apply it gradually to avoid undesirable impact from the social point of view, because it would imply a reduction of nearly 7% of the fishermen. The economic benefit would have a significant increase over 20%, these surplus income could be used to finance other economic activities to provide employment to the fishermen leaving this activity.

AB  - The City of Belgrade receives most of its drinking water supply from the alluvial aquifer of the Sava River. The wells are radial, placed in the lower part of the aquifer, so they partly run below the Sava riverbed. However, the groundwater quality of the wells in one part of the source (near the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers) is found to differ somewhat from the groundwater quality of the other wells. The finding gave rise to additional investigations. The results revealed the existence of a deeper, limestone aquifer which is isolated from upper alluvial sediments by a thick layer of clay in most of the terrain. The naturally potential hydraulic contact of the two aquifers was additionally maintained by well operation in this part of the source. According to multiple analyses of groundwater flow using a hydrodynamic mathematical model, a hydrogeological and hydraulic system of groundwater flow was defined. Although the wells are situated adjacent to the river, and some well laterals are below the riverbed, most of the groundwater that flows to the wells is partly from the wider zone of the alluvial aquifer, and partly from the deeper aquifer. The initial results of hydrochemical investigations also showed an unexpected, inverse oxic character of the groundwater in these two aquifers.

AB  - This study analyzes the relationship between physical and chemical factors and the algal communities in tropical streams in micro-watersheds where > 70% of their area has different land uses, specifically, cloud mountain forest, coffee plantations, and livestock pastures. Physical, chemical, and biological variables were measured monthly in each stream over a 1-year period. The concentrations of nitrates + nitrites, total suspended solids (TSS), and silica in the streams were found to differ during the dry and rainy seasons. Coffee-plantation streams showed the highest levels of suspended solids, nitrates + nitrites, and sulfates. Based on chlorophyll a concentration, the forest and coffee-plantation streams are oligo-mesotrophic, while pasture streams are meso-eutrophic. Forest streams displayed the lowest levels of richness and algal diversity, followed by coffee-plantation streams, whereas pasture streams were the most diverse. Chlorophyll a concentration and species richness depended on land use and season. Forest coverage was positively correlated with acidophilous and oligo-eutraphentic diatom species. Coffee coverage displayed a significant positive correlation with motile species and a significant negative correlation with pollution-sensitive diatom taxa. The results show that diatom assemblages responded to micro-watershed conditions and can be used to monitor the effects of land use on streams in tropical regions.

AB  - A field study in a region of intensive agriculture was carried out in order to assess the in situ effects of herbicides on natural periphytic diatom communities. Artificial substrates were placed in rivers at ten sites and for five 3-week periods, in spring and in autumn 2008. The composition of diatom communities at the end of each period was related to water chemical conditions. River contamination by herbicides was estimated with passive samplers (POCIS) which can integrate variations in concentrations over a few weeks. Multivariate analysis resulted in the identification of two distinct groups of samples differing by their diatom community compositions and by nutrient and herbicide concentrations. It was difficult to discuss separately the effect of nutrients and herbicides because of the high correlation of these two factors. Diatom communities from the most polluted sites had lower species diversity. Some species of the genera Achnanthidium, Cocconeis and Rhoicosphenia appeared like potential bioindicators of perturbation by agriculture. The observed variations in diatom community composition probably resulted from eutrophication and herbicide toxicity. However in some cases with such investigation methods, the herbicides found in those rivers did not seem to have a prominent effect on diatom communities.

(cheatgrass) invasion following fire disturbance and the effectiveness of revegetation its a means of rehabilitation ill it degraded semiarid shrubsteppe system. The effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts was assessed relative to arthropod richness, vegetation and arthropod community composition, and ground-cover characteristics ill 3 habitats: undisturbed, burned and weed infested (B. tectorum), and burned then rehabilitated with native and nonnative vegetation. Arthropods were collected ill each habitat using pitfall traps. Differences ill arthropod richness were compared using rarefaction curves. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and nonparametric multivariate statistical procedures, including analysis of similarity and similarity percentage routines, were used to compare arthropod and vegetation community composition and ground-cover characteristics between habitats. Arthropod communities in the rehabilitated habitat were distinct front those observed ill the undisturbed and weed-infested habitats. Rehabilitation ill this study resulted ill a shift toward conditions observed ill an undisturbed habitat and perhaps is all intermediate step to Complete restoration. Arthropod richness, arthropod and vegetation community composition, and ground-cover characteristics were all useful indicators but returned slightly different results. Assessing multiple variables yielded the most complete understanding of the habitats studied.

AB  - Governments world-wide increasingly see energy efficiency as an important aspect of sustainability. However, there is a debate in the literature as to whether the impact of improved energy efficiency on reducing energy use might be partially, or more than wholly, offset through "rebound" and "backfire" effects. This paper clarifies the theoretical conditions under which such effects would occur and explores their likely significance using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Scottish economy. We find that for Scotland a general improvement in energy efficiency in the production sectors of the economy initially produces rebound effects that eventually grow into backfire. Energy use ultimately increases in response to an efficiency gain and the ratio of GDP to CO2 emissions falls. The economic factors underpinning rebound effects are straightforward: energy efficiency improvements result in an effective cut in energy prices, which produces output, substitution, competitiveness and income effects that stimulate energy demands. However, the presence of strong rebound or even backfire does not mean that efficiency-enhancing policies are irrelevant: rather it suggests that such policies operating alone are insufficient to generate environmental improvements. The implication is that a co-ordinated portfolio of energy policies is required. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, we evaluate the effect of both formal and informal childcare support systems on the post-divorce labour supply of divorced mothers. To this end, we model the change in working hours before and after divorce by using a multilevel approach, estimating the impact of both micro- and macro-level determinants. Although we find empirical evidence for the hypothesis that a country's institutional environment plays an important role in facilitating employment as a strategy for mothers to cope with their financial losses following partnership dissolution, our conclusion is that the change in labour supply is more responsive to the whole of a country's family policies rather than to so-called 'domain-specific' indicators of formal and informal childcare provision. Furthermore, our empirical evidence suggests that at the micro-level, formal and informal childcare strategies are connected. The complementary role of informal support systems, facilitating the use of formal childcare, is an important finding from a policy point of view. However, further research will have to make clear which conditions have to be fulfilled in order to help divorced mothers to combine work and care, thus enabling them to mitigate the economic consequences of partnership dissolution.

AB  - The Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum, similar to 55 million years ago, was a brief period of widespread, extreme climatic warming(1-3), that was associated with massive atmospheric greenhouse gas input(4). Although aspects of the resulting environmental changes are well documented at low latitudes, no data were available to quantify simultaneous changes in the Arctic region. Here we identify the Palaeocene/Eocene thermal maximum in a marine sedimentary sequence obtained during the Arctic Coring Expedition(5). We show that sea surface temperatures near the North Pole increased from similar to 18 degrees C to over 23 degrees C during this event. Such warm values imply the absence of ice and thus exclude the influence of ice-albedo feedbacks on this Arctic warming. At the same time, sea level rose while anoxic and euxinic conditions developed in the ocean's bottom waters and photic zone, respectively. Increasing temperature and sea level match expectations based on palaeoclimate model simulations(6), but the absolute polar temperatures that we derive before, during and after the event are more than 10 degrees C warmer than those model-predicted. This suggests that higher-than-modern greenhouse gas concentrations must have operated in conjunction with other feedback mechanisms - perhaps polar stratospheric clouds(7) or hurricane-induced ocean mixing(8) - to amplify early Palaeogene polar temperatures.

AB  - This paper describes the use of multiple criteria decision making techniques as decision tools for assessing criteria and indicators designed to evaluate sustainable forest management. Three techniques called ranking, rating, and pairwise comparisons are described and used within the framework of a generic set of criteria and indicators applied in a case study involving a forest concession in Kalimantan, Indonesia. For the case study, an assessment team consisting of national and international experts representing Various disciplines was chosen to conduct an assessment of the forest concession. The criteria and indicators (C&I) developed by the Center for International Forestry Research was used as a reference. From this generic set of C&I, the assessment team made revisions to make the set more relevant to the prevailing conditions in the forest concession. This modified set was used in the assessment of the concession.
   Results from the study indicate that these techniques are effective tools both for selecting sets of criteria and indicators and eventually for prioritizing them. The methods are highly transparent, easy to understand, and offer a convenient environment for participatory decision making. These are desirable features of any evaluation process but most especially for a complex assessment problem such as forest sustainability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The butterfly assemblages of pairs of forest habitats, differing in disturbance level, within the Victoria Mayaro reserve of South-East Trinidad, are described using walk-and-count transects and canopy and understorey fruit traps. The concurrent use of these two butterfly censusing techniques, revealed major but conflicting differences in species accumulation rates under different disturbance conditions. The disturbed evergreen habitat had the significantly highest accumulation rate from walk-and-count data but the significantly lowest from fruit trap data. This reflects the specificity of much of the fruit-feeding guild for closed canopy forest. Disturbed habitats were found to lack a distinct canopy fauna. These results are discussed In light of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Within a region of forest, butterflies were found to be more characteristic of a disturbance level than of a particular forest type, lending weight to the belief that butterfly faunas can be used as bioindicators of forest disturbance. Several restricted geographic range species were not adversely affected by forest disturbance, at these levels of disturbance. The butterfly censuses in this study suggest that the optimal strategy for safeguarding butterfly species richness under natural forest management regimes would be to maintain a mosaic of habitats that included areas of undisturbed primary forest and a network of other forest patches, that varied in management regime and level of disturbance.

AB  - Urinary hippuric acid (uHA) is one of the biomonitoring parameters of toxic organic exposure, such as toluene.Repeated exposure to a low concentration of toluene may lead to chronic effects such as central nervous system damage. In the preliminary study, toluene was found in the batik industry's working area in Yogyakarta,Indonesia. This study aims to assess the health condition of batik workers to toluene exposure based on the concentration of uHA. There were 52 respondents divided into 2 groups: the batik workers as the exposed group(30 respondents) and the non-batik workers as the control group (22 respondents). The urine sample was taken from batik workers at the end of the shift, and uHA was measured using spectrophotometry. The uHA value was corrected with urinary creatinine. The results showed that the average uHA concentration of batik workers was higher than that of the control group. The result also showed that workers with more than 2 years working period,writing workers, and stamping workers give an Odds Ratio (OR) of 6.43, 6.75, and 9.00 respectively on having a higher concentration of uHA. Workers with toluene exposure symptoms were also having a higher concentration of uHA than workers without any symptoms.

AB  - The objectives of this research were, first, to determine the concentrations of certain heavy metals in the edible tissue of wild brown trout (Salmo trutta trutta) from two different rivers located in the Abruzzi region (Italy), and then, to investigate the levels of variation in vitellogenin (VTG) associated with the presence of metalloestrogens. VTG is an effective indicator for endocrine disturbance, and an increase in the vitellogenin levels in male fish is widely employed as a biomarker of estrogenic contamination in the aquatic environment. The muscles of the trout were analyzed for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, Al, and Zn using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), and Hg was measured using a direct mercury analyzer (DMA-80). The calculated values of the condition factor confirmed a healthy status for this species, indicating that the aquatic habit in both rivers is suitable for brown trout life. No significant difference in the concentrations of each metal were reported between the trout from the two rivers, and no significant difference for VTG levels were found between male and female fish. It is interesting to note the high concentrations of Al/Zn, while the Pb, Cd, and Hg concentrations in all of the samples were lower than those established by the European Commission.

AB  - The presence of natural fractures in fractured media plays a vital role in the in-situ stress state, which is predominantly influenced by tectonic stresses and local perturbations. Fracture orientation, wellbore stability/orientation, and permeability anisotropy are strongly dependent on local stress variations. In this study, a discrete fracture network (DFN) was generated using the stochastic approach to investigate the correlation between geometrical properties of the fracture network (fracture density and length) and local stress variability. Afterward, the FLAC(2D) software was employed to propagate the stress redistribution in the simulation process. Considering the tensorial nature of stress, a stress field was calculated under orthogonal static boundary conditions. A tensor-based mathematical formulation was applied to compute total stress variability, shear strain distribution, and total displacement in different fracture network realizations. The results demonstrated that the mean local stress perturbation, effective variance (as an indicator of total stress variability), shear strain distribution, and total displacement increased with the rise of stress ratio and fracture density. The aforementioned parameters decreased as the power-law length exponent of the DFN generator increased. Overall, it is concluded that the stress/strain variability and total displacement in a dense fracture network and large length fractures have their maximum values.

AB  - The increase in overweight and obesity among children has emerged as an important public health issue. This trend has highlighted the need for accessible and novel approaches to support healthy weights for children and their families to prevent childhood obesity. The purpose of this article is to describe the iterative development and scale-up of a community-led, national-level project to promote healthy weights among Canadian children and families who may be experiencing vulnerabilities. In this project, the Healthy Together program was designed to engage families in an interactive program to support healthy lifestyles. The program also provides a platform for creating supportive environments for healthful lifestyles through practice and policy change. Based on a process evaluation, we describe the iterative development of Healthy Together from Phase 1 through 3 to shed light on processes shaping implementation and scale-up of the program. Lessons learned during each phase were used to refine the program and further expansion. Indicators of successful scale-up include the Healthy Together program?s cross-jurisdictional reach and promising evaluation results in real-world conditions. The practice-based program scaling approach provides practical guidance for planning and implementing similar health promotion programs in diverse communities.

AB  - The use of plants as bioindicators can be effective for environmental monitoring, mainly related to heavy metals such as copper (Cu). In vitro conditions are more easily controlled, to enable isolating the stress factors that can interfere in plants' responses. The aim was to investigate the morphophysiological responses of Aechmea blanchetiana submitted to excess Cu, and to verify the degree of tolerance and potential as a bioindicator of this species. Previously cultured shoots of A. blanchetiana were transferred to agar-solidified MS medium. After 60 days, the tank system was recreated, with the addition of stationary liquid MS medium with different concentrations of Cu (0, 25, 50 and 100 mu M). After 90 days with excess Cu, anatomical analysis along with quantification of the contents of nutrients, photosynthetic pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence were carried out. Alterations in the stomatal density and chlorenchyma thickness were observed in the plants grown with excess Cu. There was an increase in the Cu content in the plants in function of the Cu levels. However, the adjustments in the content of the other nutrients were essential for tolerance to excess Cu. Aechmea blanchetiana tolerates high Cu concentrations and has potential for use as a bioindicator.

AB  - In conditions of institutional transformation it is difficult to overestimate the role of economic research for the development of the market system and the formation of a socially sustainable society. This is especially important in the financial environment, the correct vector of development of which provides economic growth of any regional system. In this regard, there is a need to expand the methods of assessing the attraction of financial resources and analysis of the investment potential of the local system. Any economic system is a complex mechanism, formed under the influence of a large number of factors. And the appropriateness of the final evaluation depends on the correctness of the choice of this or that criterion. However, in order to build the right model for the optimal development of the economic system, an analysis of a large number of indicators is required, which would allow an assessment of the current situation and propose alternative solutions. The paper proposes the formation of a methodological approach to assess the investment attractiveness of the economic system. The basis is the method of cluster analysis and the determination of the factor factor by selecting the effective criteria of the greatest significant load. Ranking of subjects of the Russian Federation according to the level of investment potential was made, recommendations on increasing the interest of external investors to the regional system were developed.

AB  - This protocol demonstrates a customized bioaerosol sampling method for viruses. In this system, anion exchange resin is coupled with liquid impingement-based air sampling devices for efficacious concentration of negatively-charged viruses from bioaerosols. Thus, the resin serves as an additional concentration step in the bioaerosol sampling workflow. Nucleic acid extraction of the viral particles is then performed directly from the anion exchange resin, with the resulting sample suitable for molecular analyses. Further, this protocol describes a custom-built bioaerosol chamber capable of generating virus-laden bioaerosols under a variety of environmental conditions and allowing for continuous monitoring of environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and aerosol mass concentration. The main advantage of using this protocol is increased sensitivity of viral detection, as assessed via direct comparison to an unmodified conventional liquid impinger. Other advantages include the potential to concentrate diverse negatively-charged viruses, the low cost of anion exchange resin (similar to$0.14 per sample), and ease of use. Disadvantages include the inability of this protocol to assess infectivity of resin-adsorbed viral particles, and potentially the need for the optimization of the liquid sampling buffer used within the impinger.

AB  - Transportation disadvantage refers to the barriers to or limits on the participation in daily socioeconomic and political life due to the reduced physical accessibility to services and opportunities. The transportation disadvantaged groups not only face the problems of social exclusion in location, but also experience greater exposure to a diversity of social and environmental threat. Under this context, identifying the transportation disadvantaged neighborhoods is of great interest for urban planners. This paper examines the transportation disadvantage in association with neighborhood sociodemographics in Shenzhen, China. A set of multidimensional indicators are initially selected to measure the transportation disadvantage (physical conditions, public transport services, education opportunity, employment opportunity, medical care opportunity, food opportunity, and commercial opportunity). Based on these indicators, principal component analysis produces four composite indicators of different types of transportation disadvantage: transportation disadvantage in physical infrastructure and public services, transportation disadvantage in food and education accessibility, transportation disadvantage in medical care accessibility, and transportation disadvantage in commercial and employment accessibility. In space, the transportation disadvantaged neighborhoods are generally located in the outskirts. Transportation disadvantage is more likely to be observed in neighborhoods that are economically, educationally, residentially and occupationally disadvantaged. These findings reveal significant inequalities in transportation opportunity.

AB  - Genetically encoded sensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are powerful tools for quantifying and visualizing analytes in living cells, and when re targeted to organelles have the potential to define distribution of analytes in different parts of the cell. However, quantitative estimates of analyte distribution require rigorous and systematic analysis of sensor functionality in different locations. In this work, we establish methods to critically evaluate sensor performance in different organelles and carry out a side-by-side comparison of three different genetically encoded sensor platforms for quantifying cellular zinc ions (Zn2+). Calibration conditions are optimized for high dynamic range and stable FRET signals. Using a combination of single-cell microscopy and a novel microfluidic platform capable of screening thousands of cells in a few hours, we observe differential performance of these sensors in the cytosol compared to the ER of HeLa cells, and identify the formation of oxidative oligomers of the sensors in the ER. Finally, we use new methodology to re-evaluate the binding parameters of these sensors both in the test tube and in living cells. Ultimately, we demonstrate that sensor responses can be affected by different cellular environments, and provide a framework for evaluating future generations of organelle-targeted sensors.

AB  - This paper examines household adaptive capacity to deal with climatic change among the Tsimane', an indigenous society of the Bolivian Amazon, and explores how exposure to conservation policies and access to markets shape such capacity. We surveyed Tsimane' adults (77 men and 34 women) living in four communities with different accessibility to the regional markets. The four communities were located in indigenous territories, but two of them overlapped with a co-managed biosphere reserve. We compared households' capacity for adaptation through indicators of access to social, financial and natural assets, entrepreneurial skills and human resources. We also assessed how conservation and markets condition such capacity. Our results show that, across communities, households clustered in four groups with differentiated adaptive capacity profiles: commoners typically participating in community meetings, vulnerable characterized by low shares of adaptive capacity indicators, leaders typically holding community positions, and subsidized mostly relying in government remittances. Overlap with the biosphere reserve was significantly associated with the adaptive capacity profile of vulnerable households. In contrast, access to markets does not seem to be related to household adaptive capacity. We discuss relevant behavioral and structural factors for current adaptation to climatic changes and priority measures to foster local adaptive capacity in indigenous territories overlapping with protected areas.

AB  - Poyang Lake is China's largest freshwater lake in summer and provides important habitat for an internationally significant assemblage of waterbirds in winter. Human-caused alterations to this system threaten to compromise the long-term viability of these bird populations due to the role of water in driving habitat suitability. Little is known, however, about the patch-scale habitat selection strategies of waterbirds within Poyang. Consequently, there is potential for spatial incongruence between protected area boundaries and key habitats given the system's high variability. This study used scan and focal sampling techniques to investigate patch selection by a wintering population of the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) within the Sha Hu sub-lake basin of Poyang Lake. Eurasian Spoonbills averaged higher foraging success rates in areas with water depth of 28.1-36.6 cm compared to other areas and preferred to forage in this depth class, as indicated by usage disproportionate to availability (Manly's standardized selection index = 0.817). Defining the patch-scale habitat selection of this indicator species both quantifies the impact of hydrological changes on resource availability and spatially predicts suitable areas for wintering birdlife within a dynamic environment.

AB  - The steady state VOC concentration in automobile cabin is taken as a good indicator to characterize the material emission behaviors and evaluate the vehicular air quality. Most studies in this field focus on experimental investigation while theoretical analysis is lacking. In this paper we firstly develop a simplified physical model to describe the VOC emission from automobile materials, and then derive a theoretical correlation between the steady state cabin VOC concentration (C-a) and temperature (T), which indicates that the logarithm of C-a/T-0.75 is in a linear relationship with 1/T. Experiments of chemical emissions in three car cabins at different temperatures (24 degrees C, 29 degrees C, 35 degrees C) were conducted. Eight VOCs specified in the Chinese National Standard GB/T27630-2011 were taken for analysis. The good agreement between the correlation and experimental results from our tests, as well as the data taken from literature demonstrates the effectiveness of the derived correlation. Further study indicates that the slope and intercept of the correlation follows linear association. With the derived correlation, the steady state cabin VOC concentration different from the test conditions can be conveniently obtained. This study should be helpful for analyzing temperature-dependent emission phenomena in automobiles and predicting associated health risks.

AB  - Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic condition in childhood, with many children requiring immunomodulatory therapies for many years following diagnosis. A considerable proportion of children experience therapeutic inefficacy or substantial adverse effects, or both, but a lack of reliable clinical indicators and biomarkers to predict treatment response prevents optimization of existing therapies. The identification of valid candidate gene variants involved in the pathways of methotrexate and etanercept, the most commonly used medications in JIA, has seen little success to date. The limited success of these studies is possibly due to the presence of confounding variables in the study populations, the heterogeneity of outcome parameters used to determine treatment response and the small number of candidate gene variants analysed. The first genome-wide pharmacogenetic study in JIA has identified gene regions of particular biological interest, but these findings require validation. Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms as well as ontogeny processes might be additional factors influencing drug responses. Access to large, well-documented JIA cohorts and the rapid development of advanced genome analytics is ushering in a personalized approach to treatment. The discovery of new pharmacogenomic biomarkers and systems pathways can provide new drug targets and predictive tools for improved drug response and fewer adverse drug reactions in JIA.

AB  - The production of Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1), enterotoxins and bacteriocin-like substances was evaluated in 95 strains of Staphylococcus aureus recovered from raw bovine milk (n=31) and from food samples involved in staphylococcal food poisoning (n=64). Enterotoxigenicity tests with the membrane over agar associated to optimal sensibility plate assays were performed and showed that 96.77% of strains recovered from milk and 95.31% from food samples produced enterotoxins A, B, C, D or TSST-1. Reference strains S. epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis were used as indicator bacteria in the antagonistic assays, the first five being sensitive to antagonistic substances. Brain heart infusion agar, in pH values ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 in aerobic atmosphere showed to be the optimum condition for antagonistic activity as evaluated with the best producer strains against the most sensitive indicator bacterium, L. monocytogenes. Sensitivity to enzymes confirmed the proteinaceous nature of these substances. Neither bacteriophage activity nor fatty acids were detected and the antagonistic activity was not due to residual chloroform. Results did not establish a positive correlation between the bacteriocinogenic profile and toxigenicity in the tested S. aureus strains.

AB  - Background: Deaths in Emergency Departments (ED) should only occur in rare cases. The aim of the study was to describe the distribution of deaths in Spanish hospitals in two locations: the ED or pre-admission and in-hospital or post-admission, and their geographical distribution and possible conditioning factors.
   Patients and methods: The study was ecological. The percentage of hospital deaths prior to admission (PHDPA) compared to total hospital deaths for each center was calculated. The information was obtained from the "2009 Survey of Health Care Establishments with In-Patient facilities". This survey included information for all the Spanish hospitals. It analyzed geographical variability and its relation to the characteristics of the centers and various indicators of health care activity using non-parametric tests.
   Results: The PHDPA was 13.4%, with wide variability between regions: from 7.4% to 16.4%. PHDPA was higher in hospitals with fewer than 100 beds and those with a higher average of emergencies per ED physician.
   Conclusions: Our study reveals the important variability in PHDPA. We estimate that if 80% of those patients who had died in the ED had died in the hospital ward, hospital stays would only have been increased by less than 0.1%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, a method for the analysis of fluoroquinolone antibiotics using microwave-assisted micellar extraction combined with liquid chromatographymass spectrometry detection has been developed. Different surfactants were tested for use as extractants in the isolation of the analytes from solid samples, and several experimental designs were evaluated for the determination and optimization of the variables that affect recovery from the matrix. Under optimal conditions, we obtained recoveries greater than 73% with relative standard deviations below 8%. Compounds were detected by liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with detection limits between 0.15 and 0.55 ng g(-1) and quantification limits between 0.49 and 1.85 ng g(-1). Finally, the optimized method was applied in the determination of antibiotics in real solid samples. Four fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) were found in coastal marine sediments taken close to a marine outfall and in sewage sludge samples from a wastewater treatment plant. Concentrations ranged between 0.81 and 34.3 ng g(-1) in the sediments and 3.43 and 206.1 ng g(-1) in the sludge. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Anion exchangers were prepared from corn stalks (CS) after reaction with epichlorohydrin and triethylamine by using diethylenetriamine (DETA) as modifying agent in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The synthesis conditions for preparing corn stalks quaternary amino anion exchanger (CS-QE) by the single-factor experiments were optimized, with removal capacity of Cr(VI) and the production yield as indicators. Factors like CS dosage, volumes of organic liquid chemicals and synthesis temperatures were investigated. The optimal synthesis parameters were CS:epichlorohydrin:DMF:DETA:triethylamine = 3 g:10 mL:8 mL:13 mL:10 mL The optimal experimental temperature in the synthesis process was 100 degrees C. A relatively large removal (99.4%) was attained from a solution as concentrated as 200 mg/L at natural pH (about 4.7) with an optimized adsorbent dosage of 2 g/L The performance of CS-QE was characterized by SEM, BET surface area. FUR and Raman spectroscopic analysis. The FTIR spectrums analysis validated that a large number of amino groups with positive charge were conducted into the structure of CS-QE. The Raman shift of the Cr(VI) peak indicated the electrostatic attraction between the Cr(VI) ions and positively charged amine sites. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The blood of a freshwater catfish, Clarias batrachus Linn. was scanned for hemoflagellate infectivity by examination of fresh blood (hanging drop preparations and hematocrit) and stained smears. Trypanosoma batrachi Qadri, 1962 occurring at a prevalence of 29.5% (intensity: 4 to 20 forms/20 min scan) is reported as a new locality record (Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India). A new species of monomorphic biflagellate was also found in 8.1% of the infected fish concurrently with Trypanosoma. Based on its morpho-cytostatistical features, flagellar length, and AF:PF ratio, the new species is named Trypanoplasma haematalis n.sp. A few selected hematological parameters (Hb%, ESR, PCV, and MCH) of infected fish were estimated to ascertain the validity as an indicator of flagellate infection under natural and experimentally-induced conditions, by inoculation of 3 ml of infected blood in laboratory-reared, healthy uninfected fish. In either case, the blood parameters recorded significant changes up to a maximum of 55.79% (Hb%, Group B3), 151.04% (ESR, Group B3), 65.45% (PCV, Group B3), and 106.26% (MCH, Group B3) suggesting that hemograms of fishes may be utilized as indicators of some infestation, which offers scope to corroborate it with flagellate infectivity.

AB  - The Pleistocene lithostratigraphy exposed on northern Richards Island comprises seven units that correlate with the offshore seismostratigraphy of the eastern Beaufort Continental Shelf. Land-sea correlations, cryostratigraphic observations and proxy indicators of environmental change provide a record of palaeoenvironmental history that commences before the last glacial-interglacial cycle. After the high sea-level stand of the Last (Sangamonian) Interglaciation, marine regression exposed a large area of the eastern Beaufort Shelf to cold subaerial conditions and permafrost aggradation. Northward progradation of a braided river system was abruptly replaced by aeolian activity, probably as a result of diversion of the palaeo-Porcupine River by the advancing Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Late Wisconsinan. Glaciation of Richards Island by the Mackenzie palaeo-ice stream was brief (sometime between similar to 22000 and 16000 cal. yr BP), and deglaciation had certainly commenced by 14300 cal. yr BP and perhaps by similar to 16000 cal. yr BP or earlier. Major fluvial erosion during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition incised cross-shelf valleys and formed a regional erosion surface. The Holocene marine transgression trimmed some of the erosion surface and offshore, covered it with marine deposits. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

AB  - The disposal of soil material after ex situ treatment of contaminated soil is an issue of growing concern. The handling and use of this material are Surrounded by numerous regulatory, economic, technical and societal aspects that complicate or hinder re-cycling. As a consequence, the lack of means of recovery can in the long-term Was the whole remedial process. In addition. it can affect the competition between various treatment Options Such as ex situ, and in situ techniques and landfilling. At the same time the materials must not have any negative environmental impacts, and their Usage must be compatible with existing risk assessment and management frameworks regarding contaminated land. Other concerns such as a possible distinction against "lightly" contaminated materials, waste Status and public acceptance add to the complexity. This paper focuses on Swedish conditions, but does also provide an outlook concerning EU regulation. A summary of leaching and batch tests employed for re-Use of soil and waste is presented is well as an overview of the eco-toxicological aspects of treated materials. The main conclusion is that recycling of treated soil is desirable from numerous aspects, but his to go along an adequate risk assessment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The constant tightening of environmental regulations and the ongoing need to reduce operating costs have posed a challenge for the design of any chemical process. Process engineers use process simulators to help them perform calculations that will, ultimately, result in design parameters or operating conditions for a plant or process. Exergy is a potential indicator that can aid in the design of energy efficient chemical processes and plants. The exergy concept has been increasingly used as a tool to locate the critical energy use in many industrial processes, both chemical and non-chemical. However, currently most process simulators in the market do not offer the capability of calculating the exergy of a process. An open-source exergy calculator has been created by embedding the calculation procedure in an open-source chemical process simulator. This improves process simulation by including a potential tool for design teams to quickly evaluate several process options in detail in order to understand their energy utilisation. A simple exergy analysis for a gas processing facility is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the tool. The analysis shows where the largest quantities of exergy are being consumed within the plant, thus pointing to areas where improvement in energy usage can be made. The use of exergy as a potential design and retrofit tool is also discussed. (c) 2007 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We used empirical data on the time allocation of common murres Uria aalge in relation to measures of local prey density to examine whether adults provisioning chicks are more sensitive to changes in prey density than birds that are incubating eggs. We hypothesized that seasonal differences in food requirements of incubating and chick-rearing parents would affect the form of the relationship between time spent at the colony and local food density. We found that the relationship did differ between the incubation and chick-rearing period in 3 important ways: (1) there was a strong non-linear relationship between food density and colony attendance (luring chick-rearing and a weaker relationship during incubation; (2) incubating birds were able to maintain relatively constant rates of attendance over a wider range of food densities than chick-rearing birds and only reduced colony attendance under extremely poor feeding conditions, if at all; and (3) incubating birds spent more time attending nest sites at the colony than provisioning birds. These differences confirmed that chick-rearing parents are more sensitive to changes in food density than incubating parents, and that measurements of time allocation during the incubation period would have limited value as an indicator of ecosystem change.

AB  - The field of health measurement has a relatively brief history. Most developed countries have collected national statistical data, including health-related data, for little more than a century. It is important to understand that the decision to collect particular health-related data or health indicators is ultimately driven by social concerns. The effort is not an isolated intellectual exercise. The selection of particular health indicators reflects the perceived importance of a problem at a particular historical point in time, and the results of such measurements commonly become tools, or even ammunition, for those promoting social reforms. Thus this article has been published, and perhaps you are reading it, to focus attention on the problem of inadequately treated pain and improve our collective practice.
   One definition of measurement is "the assignment of numbers to objects or events to represent quantities of attributes according to rules" [1]. The process of measuring health involves asking standardized questions about a particular condition, and assigning numbers to the responses. Many such questions may be aggregated into a cumulative score, intended to reflect some aspect of health. Although physicians record patients' histories routinely, the difference between history-taking and health measurement is the standardized nature of the questions and the assigning of numerical scores to such results.

AB  - Carabid beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping in 44 pine and spruce forest stands in England and Scotland using chronosequences of plots across different bioclimatic zones. The sample plots were selected on the basis of plantation age, tree species, and forest category. In each plot, a range of environmental variables were measured. some of which were used to interpret differences in carabid community composition. A total of 51 carabid species was identified; the highest individual plot total being 19 species, acid the lowest two species. Correspondence analysis showed that the most significant factors affecting carabid community composition were latitude. canopy structure, soil organic matter and vegetation diversity, General linear modelling indicated that carabid species richness was negatively related to both canopy vertical structure and soil organic matter, while species diversity was negatively related to canopy vertical structure and tree species, suggesting that more species-rich, diverse carabid communities are associated with open, drier conditions. The numbers of forest specialist carabids increased with increasing plantation age, together with a corresponding decrease in non-woodland species, even for previously non-woodland sites. Consequently, longer forest rotation lengths may be expected to benefit forest carabids, particularly where stands are structurally varied with canopy gaps present.

AB  - The main objective of the present study was to attempt to assign different vegetation types in South Sweden to the Braun-Blanquet system of syntaxa. The alliance was chosen as the most appropriate phytosociological unit for this purpose. Coniferous forests represent the zonal vegetation in large parts of South Sweden: spruce forests on mesic to moist sites and pine forests on dry, often strongly oligotrophic sites can be assigned to the Piceion excelsae and Dicrano-Pinion respectively. In addition, various types of atonal vegetation (e.g., mires, springs, swamps and salt-marshes) subjected to some form of extreme environmental factor can be placed in alliances described from Central Europe. In contrast, some southern vegetation types in Sweden are difficult to assign, partly due to a lack of character species, as in the case of deciduous hardwood forests. In other cases, species of southern syntaxa are still frequent, for example in dry basiphilous grasslands and sun-exposed forest edges, but the syntaxonomical difficulties arise from an intermixture of diagnostic species of complementary alliances. This might be explained by the floristic and climatic conditions in South Sweden which deviate considerably from those in e.g. Germany, a feature supported by the communities' indicator figures for temperature and continentality. This refers particularly to the combination of rather low average temperatures and, except in the west, a strong thermal or hygric continentality.

AB  - Pollen analysis of sediments carried off slope-spring mires (Jancik I and II) in the Moravskoslezske Beskydy Mountains made it possible to reconstruct the vegetation in the area over the last millennium. The reconstruction included changes in forest cover and composition, management methods, and changes in landscape from the Middle Ages to the present. Nearly all inferred vegetation changes were most probably anthropogenic. Most of the sediments probably resulted from water-logging following deforestation. Two distinct phases in the vegetation development were inferred. The older phase reflects the natural composition of forests and the original character of the landscape before human impact. Forest communities with dominant Abies, Fagus, and Picea still covered this part of the Moravskoslezske Beskydy Mountains at the beginning of the Wallachian colonization (end of the 15th century). Other tree species were interspersed, depending on local conditions. The vegetation changed sharply a major way at the transition to the second phase. Deforestation was considerable, many soils became water-logged, and agricultural activity expanded from the lowlands into the mountains. This is shown in the pollen diagrams by the very strong decline of Abies and Fagus, high values of Poaceae and Cyperaceae, and marked increase of cultivated species, weeds of arable fields, grassland species, and, above all, indicators of eutrophicated biotopes.

AB  - In an estuary of a neotropical region located in Brazil, Urochloa arrecta occurs only in the area of freshwater. Nonetheless, information about the capacity of this population to invade areas considered inhospitable, i.e., saltwater, is scarce. In this sense, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intermediate (20 ppt) and high (30 ppt) salinity on individuals from a population of U. arrecta located in the freshwater region of an estuarine ecosystem. Analyses of plant biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus, malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide content were evaluated as possible indicators of tolerance to salt stress. Our results showed that salinity reduced growth and increased oxidative stress. However, under conditions of intermediate salinity, U. arrecta individuals showed a biomass gain greater than 60%, MDA content similar to that in freshwater, and higher nitrogen absorption and assimilation. We conclude that U. arrecta probably presents physiological adjustments that allow its survival at intermediate salinity. Thus, the ability of this species to expand in this area alerts to the importance of studies that seek to adopt policies for the control or management of the species in saline ecosystems.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a comprehensive indoor environmental quality (IEQ) evaluation conducted in seven office buildings at an Australian university. A mix of objective and subjective assessments was carried out and a total of 519 staff participated in the survey from various non-academic departments. Three types of buildings were included in this study: 'Heritage listed' (c.1880-1890s), 'Conventional' (c.1960-1980s) and 'Modern' (post 2000) office buildings. Although the measured IEQ conditions were relatively good with no significant fluctuation across the selected buildings, the discrepancy between objective IEQ data and subjective occupant evaluations was noted. The Modern building type designed with fully double-glazed facades showed the highest levels of overall comfort and satisfaction and perceived productivity, whereas the Conventional building type constructed during the late 20th-century period, notable for deep floor plates, had the lowest. The heritage listed type buildings had lower window to wall ratios, yet displayed improved occupant satisfaction across all IEQ areas over the conventional type buildings. The results support that building renovation and regular maintenance can improve occupant comfort and satisfaction within offices. The findings could be useful for property managers looking for strategies to improve the performance of their building stock.

AB  - The early detection of health disorders is a central goal in livestock production. Thus, a great demand for technologies enabling the automated detection of such issues exists. However, despite decades of research, precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies with sufficient accuracy and ready for implementation on commercial farms are rare. A central factor impeding technological development is likely the use of non-specific indicators for various issues. On commercial farms, where animals are exposed to changing environmental conditions, where they undergo different internal states and, most importantly, where they can be challenged by more than one issue at a time, such an approach leads inevitably to errors. To improve the accuracy of PLF technologies, the presented framework proposes a categorization of the aim of detection of issues related to general welfare, disease and distress and defined disease. Each decision level provides a different degree of information and therefore requires indicators varying in specificity. Based on these considerations, it becomes apparent that while most technologies aim to detect a defined health issue, they facilitate only the identification of issues related to general welfare. To achieve detection of specific issues, new indicators such as rhythmicity patterns of behaviour or physiological processes should be examined.

AB  - During the period 20016-2018 in the experimental field of RIMSA-Troyan were tested selection populations of bird's foot trefoil Syn(1), Syn(2), Syn(3), Syn(4), Syn(5), compared with to the Bulgarian variety 'Targovishte 1'. Seed yield and its structural elements were determined in the second and third years of the development of grassland and on the basis of studied reproductive indicators interrelations among them and productivity were established It was found that the maximum yield of seeds was obtained by the population Syn(1) - 0.37 t.ha(-1), with an excess over the standard by 23.73%. High productivity is determined by the large number of seeds per pod (18.6). The lowest degree of variability according to the variation coefficients was found in the number of racemes per stem (5.89), and the highest in the number of pods per plant (19.40). The established very strong correlation between the number of pods per raceme and the weight of 1000 seeds (r = 0.7939). allows to derive the regression equation - y = 0.0794x + 0.9588. Thus, the presented statistical analysis of the data from the seed productivity allows to make a complete characterization of the populations, which will serve for the further selection process.

AB  - Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects are the primary cause of inborn errors of energy metabolism. Despite considerable progress on their genetic basis, their global pathophysiological consequences remain undefined. Previous studies reported that OXPHOS dysfunction associated with complex III deficiency exacerbated the expression and mitochondrial location of cytoskeletal gelsolin (GSN) to promote cell survival responses. In humans, besides the cytosolic isoform, GSN presents a plasma isoform secreted to extracellular environments. We analyzed the interplay between both GSN isoforms in human cellular and clinical models of OXPHOS dysfunction. Regardless of its pathogenic origin, OXPHOS dysfunction induced the physiological upregulation of cytosolic GSN in the mitochondria (mGSN), in parallel with a significant downregulation of plasma GSN (pGSN) levels. Consequently, significantly high mGSN-to-pGSN ratios were associated with OXPHOS deficiency both in human cells and blood. In contrast, control cells subjected to hydrogen peroxide or staurosporine treatments showed no correlation between oxidative stress or cell death induction and the altered levels and subcellular location of GSN isoforms, suggesting their specificity for OXPHOS dysfunction. In conclusion, a high mitochondrial-to-plasma GSN ratio represents a useful cellular indicator of OXPHOS defects, with potential use for future research of a wide range of clinical conditions with mitochondrial involvement.

AB  - Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from combustion systems remain a lingering environmental issue, being these species either greenhouse gases or acid rain precursors. Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion can reduce the emissions of NOx thanks to its characteristic features (i.e., homogeneous reaction zones, reduced temperature peaks, diluted mixtures of reactants) that influence and change the main chemical pathways of NOx formation. A summary of the relevant routes of formation and destruction of NOx in MILD combustion is presented in this review, along with the identification of the sources of uncertainty that prevent reaching an overall consensus in the literature about the dominant NOx chemical pathway in MILD regime. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches are essential tools for investigating the critical phenomena occurring in MILD combustion and the design of pollutant-free turbulent combustion systems. This paper provides an outline of the modeling approaches employed in CFD simulations of turbulent combustion systems to predict NOx emissions in MILD conditions. An assessment of the performances of selected models in estimating NOx formation in a lab-scale MILD combustion burner is then presented, followed by a discussion about relevant modeling issues, perspectives and opportunities for future research.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are often excluded from wetland monitoring because samples collected using a conventional 500-m mesh sieve are time consuming to process. To facilitate increased cost-effectiveness of obtaining macroinvertebrate data, influence of sieve mesh size on relationships between macroinvertebrate and environmental variables was evaluated in 27 prairie pothole wetlands. Benthic and water-column samples were washed through sieves with mesh sizes of 6mm, 4mm, 2mm, and 500m, and macroinvertebrate numerical densities and taxon richness were quantified. Influence of particulate matter was evaluated by washing invertebrates through sieves before and after removal of this material from samples, and calculating differences in density and taxon richness. Regardless of sieve mesh size and particulate matter abundance, macroinvertebrate taxon richness exclusive of taxa occurring in all wetlands (planorbid snails, oligochaetes, leeches, chironomids) was positively correlated with plant cover, and negatively correlated with turbidity and fish biomass (p0.05).Use of a 6-mm mesh sieve reduced sample volume by 35% and processing time by 54% relative to the 500-m mesh sieve. Results suggest that reliance on taxon richness metrics and a sieve with 6-mm mesh will reduce macroinvertebrate sampling costs while still generating data that reflect wetland condition.

AB  - This paper describes a new algorithm that is able to detect snowfall and retrieve the associated snow water path (SWP), for any surface type, using the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). The algorithm is tuned and evaluated against coincident observations of the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) onboard CloudSat. It is composed of three modules for (i) snowfall detection, (ii) supercooled droplet detection and (iii) SWP retrieval. This algorithm takes into account environmental conditions to retrieve SWP and does not rely on any surface classification scheme. The snowfall detection module is able to detect 83% of snowfall events including light SWP (down to 1 x 10(-3) kgm(-2)) with a false alarm ratio of 0.12. The supercooled detection module detects 97% of events, with a false alarm ratio of 0.05. The SWP estimates show a relative bias of -11%, a correlation of 0.84 and a root mean square error of 0.04 kgm(-2). Several applications of the algorithm are highlighted: Three case studies of snowfall events are investigated, and a 2-year high resolution 70 degrees S-70 degrees N snowfall occurrence distribution is presented. These results illustrate the high potential of this algorithm for snowfall detection and SWP retrieval using GMI.

AB  - The occurrence of extensive antibiotics resistant bacteria increased the demands for mining out new sources of antimicrobial agents. Actinomycetes, especially Streptomyces sp. have grasped considerable attention worldwide due to production of many useful bioactive metabolites. In the present study, a total of 52 actinomycetes were isolated from agricultural soil samples in Beni-Suef, Egypt. All isolates were characterized based on colony morphology, mycelium coloration, and pigment diffusion. They were screened for their capabilities to show antimicrobial activities against different indicator microorganisms, and only 20 isolates have shown significant antimicrobial activities against at least one of the tested indicator microorganisms. The isolate AGM12-1 was active against all tested microorganisms and showed a marked antitumor activity with IC50 3.3 and 1.1 mu g/ml against HCT-116 and HepG-2 cell lines respectively. It was genotypically characterized as Streptomyces sp. with the presence of PKS 5 biosynthetic gene cluster. Mannitol, ammonium sulfate, pH 7, 2% inoculum size and incubation for 11 days at 30 degrees C were the optimum conditions that used to maximize the production and hence allowed purification of one active antimicrobial compound to homogeneity using high performance liquid chromatography with a molecular mass of m/z 488.05. Nuclear magnetic resonance structural elucidation showed that this compound was a diketopiperazine derivative.

AB  - Climate change impacts on marine fisheries are being observed in tropical regions, including northern Australia and the Pacific. In the Torres Strait, Islanders have a long association with their sea country that holds significant cultural, social and economic importance. Future impacts of climate change on marine fisheries stocks and supporting habitats will affect Torres Strait Islander communities. We assessed the relative vulnerability of 15 key fishery species in Torres Strait using a semi-quantitative framework modified from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that integrated both ecological and social indicators of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The assessment identified species with high, medium and low vulnerability to projected climate change in 2030. The species assessed as having the highest vulnerability were: Holothuria whitmaei (black teatfish), Pinctada margaritifera (black-lipped pearl oyster), Dugong dugon (dugong), and Trochus niloticus (trochus). A separate prioritisation process that considered the cultural and economic value of species identified three high priority species for future management focus: D. dugon, marine turtles (principally Chelonia mydas) and Panulirus ornatus (tropical rock lobster). These results can inform fishers and managers to prepare for the effects of climate change and minimise impacts. The relatively healthy condition of most fisheries in the Torres Strait is likely to assist successful adaptation.

AB  - Calcareous encrusters stabilize and bind reef framework and contribute significantly to reef function and biodiversity. Their calcareous skeletons have good preservation potential which, together with well-constrained habitat preferences, makes them useful indicators of past environmental conditions. However, our knowledge of environmental tolerances and spatial distribution trends of encrusters remains limited. Here, we determine the distributional trends and environmental tolerances of calcareous encrusters and delineate the relevance of particular species/genera for palaeoecological reconstructions. Artificial microhabitats were created to mimic exposed, partially cryptic, and cryptic habitats in various orientations for periods of 1 and 2 yr. Calcareous encruster coverage was high, especially in cryptic habitats (95 %), and clear successional trends were observed over time. Total encruster carbonate production was intermediate (range 72.8-476.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Encruster species and growth morphology exhibited a defined zonation in response to reef sub-environment, microhabitat, and environmental factors such as light and wave exposure. Linear regression identified three coralline algae genera, as well as Homotrema rubrum, Planorbulina spp., and cemented bivalves as those most likely to occur in particular habitats. Therefore, the presence of these species may be used with greater confidence in distinguishing palaeomicroenvironments.

AB  - Environmentally sensitive areas along coastlines may be adversely affected by saltwater intrusion (SI), a condition which can be worsened by extensive groundwater extraction. Given the uncertainty of problem parameters, the risk of contamination of the vegetation capture zone needs to be cast in a probabilistic framework. In order to exemplify real situations existing along the Adriatic coast of Emilia-Romagna, a case study involving a pinewood strip and a well field drawing freshwater from an unconfined coastal aquifer was examined. On the basis of a widely adopted sharp interface formulation, key hydrogeological problem parameters were modeled as random variables, and a global sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine their influence on the position of the interface. This analysis utilized an efficient model reduction technique based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion. The risk that saltwater intrusion affects coastal vegetation was then evaluated via a two-step procedure by computing the probability that (i) the leading edge of the saltwater wedge reaches the sensitive area in the horizontal plane, and (ii) the freshwater/saltwater interface reaches the capture zone. The influence of the design parameters of the well field on the overall probability of contamination was investigated, revealing the primary role of the pumping discharge in the examined configuration.

AB  - Heat-shock proteins (HSP) are molecular chaperones that play key roles in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis under variable environmental conditions. Although HSP are frequently used in studies of wild vertebrates as indicators of stress, no one to date has assessed responses of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 in the same species to different environmental stressors. We studied changes in the circulating concentrations of HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 in wild-caught House Finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) in response to multiple and sequential stressful environments, including high temperatures, transportation, and pathogen exposure. House Finches sampled during a period of low-environmental stress with moderate ambient temperatures had low levels of HSP60 and modest levels of HSP70 and HSP90 compared to birds sampled during a presumably more stressful period with high temperatures. After exposure to high-ambient temperatures, transportation in a vehicle, and exposure to Mycoplasma gallisepticum, captive finches were found to have increasingly higher levels of HSP60. HSP70 tended to rise in response to each stressor, but to drop in the weeks between stress challenges. HSP90 levels increased significantly only in response to pathogen challenge. Our observations suggest that HSP60 and HSP70 are indices of a range of stressors in House Finches, whereas HSP90 primarily reflects health state.

AB  - This study sought to analyse the effects of climate change on Artemisia species growing in Sierra Nevada, a high mountain range in the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula, using pollen counts as a bioindicator. The study also examined the impact of Recovery Programmes implemented for the most endangered of these species. Analysis of historical Artemisia pollen-data series from 1992 to 2011 showed that flowering took place between late July and late September, but the trend towards higher summer temperatures detected over the series as a whole appeared to have delayed the start of flowering and brought forward the end of flowering, thus prompting a shortening of the season. A trend was also observed towards a delayed peak pollen period, together with a significant decline in the Annual Pollen Index, which was significantly influenced by rainfall over the months immediately prior to flowering. Recovery Programmes implemented for three species-Artemisia granatensis, A. alba subsp. nevadensis and A. umbelliformis-involved conservation measures including direct seeding and planting of seedlings. From the outset, these programmes led to a recovery of the Pollen Index, especially when using germinated seedlings, which adapted better than seeds to environmental conditions. In conclusion, pollen records proved to be a useful tool for assessing the status of endangered species.

AB  - Differential scanning calorimetry measures the heat capacity of states and the excess heat associated with transitions that can be induced by temperature change. The integral of the excess heat capacity is the enthalpy for this process. Despite this potentially intimidating sounding physical chemistry background, DSC has found almost universal application in studying biological macromolecules. In the case of proteins, DSC can be used to determine equilibrium thermodynamic stability and folding mechanism but can also be used in a more qualitative manner screening for thermal stability as an indicator for, ligand binding, pharmaceutical formulation or conditions conducive to crystal growth. DSC usually forms part of a wider biophysical characterisation of the biological system of interest and so the literature is diverse and difficult to categorise for the technique in isolation. This review therefore describes the potential uses of DSC in studying protein folding and stability, giving brief examples of applications from the recent literature. There have also been some interesting developments in the use of DSC to determine barrier heights for fast folding proteins and in studying complex protein mixtures such as human plasma that are considered in more detail.

AB  - Process control of aqueous tablet coating depends on a number of thermodynamic and psychrometric variables. Since many of these variables are interdependent, the choice of parameters by which to control the process or designate a design space is not necessarily obvious. Several mass or heat conservation models for aqueous tablet coating can be found in the literature, varying in approach and proposed method for controlling the coating process. A commonly used first-principles model built upon the coupled heat and mass transfer in evaporative mass transfer derives an "Environmental Equivalency" (EE) factor as an indicator of the relative rate of water evaporation from the tablet bed surface and as a relevant scaling factor for aqueous coating. The EE factor is expressed by an equation involving ten individual parameters; however, if the derivation of EE is extended further under the context of an adiabatic process, a much-simplified yet equivalent expression for EE emerges consisting of only three parameters, each directly measurable or obtainable from a psychrometric chart and which bear direct significance to the gross thermodynamic conditions of the coating. The psychrometric model herein is presented as a more physically evocative description of the coating process, enhancing process understanding and potentially playing a key role in a Quality by Design approach to defining an aqueous coating design space.

AB  - Pilot-scale column experiments were conducted in this study using natural soil and river water from Ohio river to assess the removal of microbes of size ranging over 2 orders of magnitude, i.e., viruses (0.025-0.065 mu m), bacteria (1-2 mu m), and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (4-7 mu m) under conditions representing normal operation and flood scour events. Among these different organisms, the bacterial indicators were transported over the longest distances and highest concentrations; whereas much greater retention was observed for smaller (i.e., viral indicators) and larger (i.e., Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts) microbes. These results are in qualitative agreement with colloid filtration theory (CFT) which predicts the least removal for micrometer size colloids, suggesting that the respective sizes of the organisms was a dominant control on their transport despite expected differences in their surface characteristics. Increased fluid velocity coupled with decreased ionic strength (representative of major flood events) decreased colloid retention, also in qualitative agreement with CFT. The retention of organisms occurred disproportionately near the source relative to the log-linear expectations of CFT, and this was true both in the presence and absence of a colmation zone, suggesting that microbial removal by the RBF system is not necessarily vulnerable to flood scour of the colmation zone.

AB  - In our research conducted in the River Yarqon during 2003-2006, we identified 313 taxa of algae and cyanobacteria belonging to 8 taxonomical divisions. Out of these 313 taxa, 268 taxa (85.6%) were indicators of environmental conditions that characterised the river water as alkaline with medium mineralisation. In the rainy and dry seasons the algal taxonomic compositions were very different, with prevailing diatoms in the winter and cyabobacteria and greens in summer. Bio-indication shows that the taxonomic preference for the self-purification process was more intensive during the rainy season, while the low level of river water in the dry season stressed the algal community. By employing CCA analysis some indicators of highly mineralised water with high pH, anthropogenic pollution, and eutrophication were revealed. CCA analyses also helped to reveal various biosensor species sensitive to the advent of anthropogenic pollution. We therefore conclude that the combination of bioindicational methods with statistics is effective in the determination of the main factors influencing algal diversity. This combination is also helpful in indicating which biosensing species will influence the most important environmental parameters. The obtained results can be used for water quality assessment and in monitoring systems of Israeli and other Mediterranean coastal rivers.

AB  - This paper aims to separate different snow regions over the terrestrial ice sheets based on their measured microwave signatures. It takes advantage of coregistered data from passive and active sensors on the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) to directly derive a snow facies indicator in a point-by-point basis. This paper represents the first attempt of this kind in exploiting nadir-viewing and dual-frequency data from both altimeter and radiometer sensors. The approach is based on a clustering method. Such representation of the data by means of fewer clusters necessarily loses fine details but achieves simplification in geographical representation and eases the description of the condition of the ice sheets in 2004. Our approach broadens the description of the snow pack by taking into account characteristics such as surface roughness, grain size, stratification, and snowmelt effects, whereas the latter has often solely been considered in most previous work. Such partition of the ice sheets might help to better understand relationships between microwave signatures and snow morphology. It could also be useful for estimating elevation uncertainty in altimeter data, which, in turn, is essential to correctly interpret the significance of the rates of elevation change in a changing climate and to convert elevation change to snow mass change.

AB  - A semi-empirical mechanistic model able to simulate the dynamics of a stabilization reservoir was developed incorporating both settling of particulate components and chemical/biological processes. Several factors affecting the reservoir effluent quality were taken into account: hydraulics and hydrology, solar radiation, atmospheric reaeration, algae, zooplankton, organic matter, pathogen bacteria, and sediment-water interaction. The model quantifies the specific influence of each factor on effluent quality, evaluating the correlation between the different considered factors. State variables included in the model were: algae, dissolved oxygen, organic matter, zooplankton and indicator bacteria.
   The model was transferred into a computational code in order to provide a useful and versatile tool for water resource planning management issues. The model was verified by comparing simulated results with full-scale data collected from a small reservoir (Sicily, IT) filled with partially treated wastewater. The reservoir has a volume of 11,000 m(3), a maximum depth of 6.3 m and a mean depth of about 5 m. The monitoring period lasted four months during which the reservoir operated in different hydraulics conditions: as a standard batch reactor and as a continuous flow reactor. The model was able to reproduce the behaviour of the principal simulated parameters thus representing a potential tool for the management and performance optimization of these peculiar storage/treatment systems.

AB  - Transgenic crops able to tolerate environmental stress are being developed throughout the world. However, little data is available on the impact of environmental stress-tolerant transgenic crops on soil microorganisms and biochemistry. Recently developed transgenic potato plants carrying an environmental stress-related gene, DREB1A, with a stress-inducible promoter, are being evaluated for growth performance in greenhouses. In this study, we investigated microbial diversity and soil function to assess potential environmental risks of these transgenic potato lines, Genotypic diversity of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and activity levels of four enzymes were used as indicators of microbial genetic diversity and soil function, respectively. Salinity had a major effect on both bacterial (88-93%) and fungal (54-55%) diversity, while the transgene had a relatively small effect on genotypic structure (0-5%,) based on the analysis of variance. However, a few genotypes appeared only in soils planted with the transgenic lines. Some enzyme activities were found to differ significantly between the transgenic and non-transgenic lines, although the results were not repeatable in the second trial. These results suggest that abiotic growth environments had a stronger impact on soil microorganisms and biochemistry than did plant genotypes.

KW  - HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY
AB  - The Subsurface Disposal Area ( SDA) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory ( INEEL) contains low- level, hazardous, and transuranic wastes and is the subject of ongoing environmental assessments. The buried waste is in shallow land burial overlaying a 180- m- thick vadose zone comprised of fractured basalts and sedimentary interbeds. Applied simulation studies to predict future contaminant concentrations from this buried waste have been as part of ongoing regulatory- driven environmental assessments for the SDA. An overview of the most recent numerical simulation study is presented along with a treatment of conceptual model uncertainty. The main premise of this paper is that conceptual uncertainty likely dominates parametric uncertainty, and this dominance should be considered when designing characterization studies. Given that the current modeling is uncalibrated due to inconsistent monitoring data in the vadose zone, it is only appropriate to consider conceptual model uncertainty. Conceptual model uncertainty was addressed by modeling different scenarios. Scenarios presented in this paper are the assignment of infiltration boundary conditions, a simplistic approximation to represent facilitated transport, and alternative representations of the moisture characteristic curve for fractured basalts. Results of this subsurface transport modeling have been used in part to guide additional field characterization activities. Eventually, predicted concentrations from this applied model will be used to estimate human health risks for a potential future receptor as part of the environmental process.

AB  - One of the important methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of soil erosion models is to compare the predictions given by the model to measured data from soil loss collected on plots taken under natural rainfall conditions. While it is recognized that plot data contain natural variability, this factor is not quantitatively considered during such evaluations because our knowledge of natural variability between plots which have the same treatments is very limited. The goal of this study was to analyse sufficient replicated plot data and present methodology to allow the model evaluator to take natural, within-treatment variability of erosion plots into account when models are tested. A large amount of data from pairs of replicated erosion plots was evaluated and quantified. The basis for the evaluation method presented is that if the difference between the model prediction and a measured plot data value lies within the population of differences between pairs of measured values, then the prediction is considered 'acceptable'. A model 'effectiveness' coefficient was defined for studies undertaken on large numbers of prediction versus measured data comparisons. This method provides a quantitative criterion for taking into account natural variability and uncertainty in measured erosion plot data when those data are used to evaluate erosion models.

AB  - A rapid immunological method for trapping and selection of functionally regulated prokaryotic promoters is described. The method is based on application of a novel mini-Tn5 derived promoter probe (pUTTKZY-promoterless lacZY as a reporter and kanamycin resistance) to mutagenise a plant growth promoting fluorescent pseudomonad, Pseudomonas fluorescens 54/96. The transposon allows selection of operon fusion mutants (lacZY(+)) directly on media containing lactose as a sole carbon source as well as selection for kanamycin and lacZ (beta-galactosidase) expression on X-gal indicator media. We have extended the technique to target the surface expression of the induced lactose permease gene (lacY) from mutagenised libraries and the immune-capture of bacteria with magnetic beads and anti-LacY monospecifc antisera. The benefits of the lacZY reporter are that a library can be rapidly generated and screened in vitro to isolate non-expressed mutants for further in situ screening. Here we demonstrate the development and utility of the technique and its potential as a differential display method for the isolation of promoters that direct regulated gene expression in the phytosphere, or under other imposed conditions.

AB  - It has often been suggested that ultrastructural properties of mitochondria are correlated with oxygen and sulfide levels from the environment, although careful analyses of this question are rare. In this study the ultrastructure and distribution of mitochondria in Tubificoides benedii, a marine oligochaete from sulfide-rich sediments, were investigated after a series of oxic, hypoxic and hypoxic-sulfidic (200 mu M H2S) incubations up to 24 h. Succinate, one of the key endproducts of an anaerobic metabolism, was used as an indicator of mitochondrial anaerobiosis. Consistent differences in mitochondrial ultrastructure were not observed in any of the incubations, even after 24 h. Stereological parameters of mitochondria (volume density, surface density of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and specific surface) in epidermal and intestinal tissues of T. benedii were not affected by hypoxia or sulfide either. On the other hand, succinate concentrations increased significantly within 24 h under hypoxic and hypoxic-sulfidic conditions. Thus, experimental hypoxia and sulfide clearly caused mitochondrial anaerobiosis without affecting ultrastructure or distribution of mitochondria in T. benedii. Distinct differences in ultrastructural and stereological parameters were common between different tissues and between individuals, showing that different forms of mitochondria can occur within one species. Our results imply that a mitochondrial ultrastructure specific to thiobiotic animals does not appear to exist.

AB  - This study compared a chromogenic and fluorogenic substrate based medium, Colisure, with the conventional fermentation based medium, lauryl tryptose broth (LTB), for the recovery of chlorine-injured and non-injured coliforms and E. coli. Mixed natural populations of coliforms from sewage, with and without chlorine exposure, and untreated surface water samples were examined following a USEPA established procedure. Colisure and LTB were examined after 20, 24, 28 and 48h incubation and reactions verified. There were slight increases in positive reactions over time with unchlorinated samples, for which the two media gave similar kinetic patterns. The increases over time with chlorinated samples were much greater than with unchlorinated samples. LTB gave significantly lower total positive responses and had a more pronounced lag period than did Colisure. Total coliform bacteria from surface water samples gave somewhat different reactions with more of an increase with time. Colisure recovered comparable or higher numbers of total coliforms and E. coli in 20-28h than LTB after 48h. These results confirm that Colisure gives improved recovery of chlorine-injured total coliforms and E. coli under conditions simulating treated drinking and source water, resulting in a more realistic estimate of the actual population of indicator bacteria in public water supplies.

AB  - Yaks (Bos grunniens) live primarily in high-altitude hypoxic conditions and have a unique intestinal micro-ecosystem, remarkable adaptability, and strong climatic resistance. Accumulating evidence revealed the importance of probiotics in host metabolism, gut microbiota, growth performance, and health. The goal of this study was to screen out probiotics with excellent probiotic potential for clinical application. In this study, four strains of Bacillus, i.e., Bacillus proteolyticus (named Z1 and Z2), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (named J), and Bacillus subtilis (named K), were isolated and identified. Afterward, their probiotic potential was evaluated. Antioxidant activity tests revealed that Z1 had the highest DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, whereas Z2 had higher reducing power and inhibited lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the antibacterial testing revealed that all strains were antagonistic to three indicator pathogens, Escherichia coli C83902, Staphylococcus aureus BNCC186335, and Salmonella enteritidis NTNC13349. These isolates also had a higher hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and acid and bile tolerance, all of which helped to survive and keep dangerous bacteria out of the host intestine. Importantly, all strains could be considered safe in terms of antibiotic susceptibility and lack of hemolysis. In conclusion, this is the first study to show that B. proteolyticus and B. amyloliquefaciens isolated from yaks have probiotic potential, providing a better foundation for future clinical use.

AB  - The purpose of the study is a scientific and theoretical substantiation of the energy characteristics of ultra and nano filtration, which directly depend on the quality of the source water, to ensure reliable and uninterrupted operation of a combined water treatment plant (CWTP), to obtain high-quality drinking water in water supply systems in-tended for settlements and industrial facilities. The developed method of combined operation of a water treatment plant is based on membrane technology, the efficiency of which directly depends on the preliminary improvement of the quality of purified low-mineralized water using an energy-efficient membrane, post-treatment and subsequent disinfection. Indicators of the quality of treated water that meet regulatory requirements and indicators of improving the energy efficiency of the water treatment plant have been investigated and calculated on the basis of experimental data. The results of studies on low-mineralized water made it possible to obtain TDS (Total dissolved solids) with a total residual concentration of hardness and chlorides in the range of 0.77 mg/dm(3) without any prob- lems. The proposed combined water treatment plant method is a priority among fundamental and applied works in the field of water treatment, it is intended for the purification of natural waters under conditions of increased anthropogenic loads on natural water sources.

AB  - This paper adopts an integrated method of field test and numerical simulation to study coal pillar width and surrounding rock control of gob-side entry in extra-thick coal seam. Field test showed that when the coal pillar width was 30 m, the average plastic failure areas of the roof, coal pillar rib and virgin coal rib were 7.6 m, 4.9 and 3.8 m, respectively, and severe roof subsidence and large deformation of coal pillar rib occurred during the mining of the working face. A numerical model is established to study the change of plastic bearing zone and the distribution of stress and displacement under different pillar widths. The numerical results show that a coal pillar 8 m wide can meet the strength requirement of overlying load and puts the gob-side entry in a good stress environment. Finally, an optimal coal pillar width was estimated at 8 m and an effective support method was proposed. Drilling imaging data indicate that the newly designed pillar size and the proposed supporting method can ensure roadway stability. The proposed plastic bearing zone and zero-displacement plane are reliable indicators for designing pillar size. In addition, the new support strategy can be applied to other coal mines with similar geological conditions.

AB  - This study employs 29 provincial-level administrative regions in China from 2013 to 2017 to evaluate the overall efficiency score of hydropower electricity generation in the three main regions of China. The EBM (Epsilon-based Measure) model with the DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) method uses installed capacity data, labor force data, and equipment utilization hours as input indicators and electricity generation and CO2 emission reduction as output indicators. By comparing the efficiency values of the two indices of installed capacity and CO2 emission reduction, we are able to analyze the differences between installed hydropower electricity generation capacity efficiency and carbon emission reduction efficiency in various provinces and cities. The findings show that the western region is the best, followed by the central region and then the eastern region in terms of the input-output index level, total efficiency score of hydropower, and comparison of installed capacity-carbon emission reduction efficiency. Natural water resources and geographical advantages have a great positive effect on hydropower efficiency, while economic development has little effect on it. China should promote the sustainable development of hydropower according to local conditions and formulate and adopt countermeasures in line with the different circumstances between regions.

AB  - There have been more concerns over energy resource depletion and indoor comfort improvement along with the increased time spend in a building. Building operation requires more energy in the spaces of high occupancy density in public buildings in summer because most energy has been consumed to make the indoor environment comfortable. Therefore, there is a conflicting issue for optimization, which is minimum energy consumption vs. maximum indoor comfort. In this paper, the indoor comfort model was established based on the weights of the thermal environment and air quality. The indoor air temperature, indoor relative humidity and indoor CO2 concentration as KPI (Key performance indicators) are optimized dynamically according to different outdoor meteorological parameters and different indoor occupancy density by an improved multi-objective optimization method of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). A single suitable solution from the non-inferior solutions is selected by the method of fuzzy comprehensive decision. The single solution of those KPI can be used as the set point of air-conditioning controller. A case study was carried out and the corresponding simulation of optimization of energy and comfort was presented. The results showed that the methodology can achieve the maintenance of indoor comfort and energy consumption reduction.

AB  - Materials held within mine tailings pose a serious risk to the environment in cases of tailings dam failure. Collapse of the tailing dam at the Stolice antimony mine in West Serbia caused a spilling of tailing slurry into the nearby river watersheds. Medium-term effects of As, Pb, Sb, Zn, and Cd from the tailings material that remained in the flooded zone 3 years after the initial exposure were evaluated. Mobility of these elements was determined by analyzing their distribution between exchangeable, reducible, oxidizable, and residual phases. Results indicate that Fe-Mn oxides represent important sinks for As, Cd, Pb, and Sb. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that concentrations of the analyzed elements were related to sand-sized fractions, as they tended to adsorb or co-precipitate as coatings on larger particles (particularly feldspar and quartz) upon the change of redox conditions. Assessment of the most relevant physico-chemical factors, metal(loid) concentration, and mobility can be used as tool to characterize the degree of contamination of impacted sites. Percentage of sand-sized particles, content of investigated metal(loid)s, and their amount in the reducible fractions are factors determining the best remediation techniques for the area impacted by tailing spill.

AB  - Free-range livestock grazing is a widespread human activity that not only modifies natural vegetation but also leads to interactions with wild ungulates. Most commonly, the interactions between cattle and wild ungulates have been studied with a focus on competition for high-quality forage. However, other mechanisms, such as the risk of parasite infection, might better describe this interaction. We aim to determine whether livestock affect roe deer (Capreolus capreolus Linnaeus, 1758) by reducing habitat quality and increasing the probability of infection by shared parasites. We measured noninvasive fecal cortisol metabolites as an indicator of habitat quality as well as the lung nematode larvae burden from the Dictyocaulus genus. A higher Dictyocaulus larvae load was found in the presence of livestock in pines, and feces collected in winter had a higher parasite load than feces collected in autumn. Additionally, fecal cortisol metabolite levels in the roe deer were affected by the interaction between habitat quality and livestock presence and were higher in the poorest habitat and when living in sympatry with cattle. Our results suggest that physiological stress responses in roe deer were mediated by the habitat type and the presence of competitors. The long-term implications of altered physiological responses such as those demonstrated here should be considered in management strategies for deer.

AB  - Genetic purity test of true hybrids from controlled crosses before further generations of selling or crossing and selection is essential for Mungbean improvement. The present study was conducted to transfer mungbean yellow mosaic (MYM) disease resistance in mungbean from ricebean and to assess the genetic purity of developed inter-specific F-1 hybrids using morphological features and microsatellite markers. Inter-specific crosses were made involving two genotypes of mungbean viz., K 851 and TM 96-2 and one genotype of ricebean (RBL 1) where the crossability results revealed significant differences. Crossability was recorded 8.2 0 (TM 96-2 x RBL 1) and 4.6 0 (K 851 x RBL 1). Pollen fertility was recorded 1.6 o and 3.4 0 in TM 96-2 x RBL 1 and K 851 x RBL 1. respectively. Morphological features such as epicotyl colour. hypocotyl length, petiole length, germination habit, etc., were used as indicators of true hybridity. Further, the microsatellite markers were used to confirm the genetic purity of the developed inter-specific hybrid. These hybrids exhibited resistance against mungbean yellow mosaic disease under natural epiphytotic field conditions. The present study will be useful in developing high yielding varieties or lines of mungbean coupled with stable MYMV resistance.

AB  - In earlier ecophysiological studies that were conducted on Arabidopsis halleri plants, scientists focused on the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation but did not take into consideration the environmental factors that can significantly affect the physiological responses of plants in situ. In this study, we investigated A. halleri that was growing on two nonmetalliferous and three metalliferous sites, which were characterized by different environmental conditions. We compared these populations in order to find differences within the metallicolous and nonmetallicolous groups that have not yet been investigated. The concentrations of several elements in the plant and soil samples also were investigated. To our knowledge, the concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll were measured for A. halleri in situ for the first time. Our study confirmed the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn for each metallicolous population. For the metallicolous populations, the inhibition of parameters that describe the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus with increasing accumulations of heavy metals in the shoots also was observed. It was found that the nonmetallicolous plant populations from the summit of Ciemniak Mountain had larger antenna dimensions and chlorophyll content but a lower percentage of active reaction centers. To our knowledge, in this study, the internal high physiological diversity within the populations that inhabit metalliferous and nonmetalliferous sites is presented for the first time.

AB  - The aim of this research is to evaluate the ability of transplanted lichen Pseudovernia (P). furfuracea to biomonitor and bioaccumulate in urban indoor environments. The elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni and Pb and 12 selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were used to assess P. furfuracea as a biomonitoring tool for the indoor air quality of school environments. To achieve this purpose, lichen samples were exposed for 2 months in the outdoor and indoor environments of five school settings located in urban and rural areas. The results demonstrated that transplanted lichen P. furfuracea is a suitable biomonitoring tool for metals and PAHs in indoor settings and can discriminate between different levels of air pollution related to urbanisation and indoor conditions, such as those characterised by school environments. A transplanted lichen biomonitoring strategy is cost-effective, "green", educational for attending children and less "invasive" than traditional air sampling methods. The feasibility of indoor monitoring by P. furfuracea is a relevant finding and could be a key tool to improve air quality monitoring programmes in school scenarios and thus focus on health prevention interventions for children, who are one of the most susceptible groups in the population.

AB  - This work evaluated two different digital soil mapping methods for mapping the presence of iron pans in South West France. The presence of iron pans limit rooting depth, thereby affecting available water content for plants and increasing vulnerability of trees to storms. In some cases, it may also limit the water infiltration rate and cause anaerobic conditions limiting rooting depth, biological activity and plant growth. This work evaluates the potential of a road-side survey sampling and subsequent digital soil mapping techniques to map the probability of iron pan presence in a French region. We tested 1) indicator kriging without taking into account ancillary covariates and compared the mapped probability with 2) logistic regression kriging which did account for ancillary covariates. The probability of iron pan occurrence was mapped at a regional level with a reasonable precision but adding ancillary co-variates to the model gave more realistic predictions. Likely, the goodness of the prediction is still hampered by the resolution of the employed DEM and by the spatial distribution of the observation points. Furthermore, we made some suggestions of the possible usage of the iron pan map; probability maps could help regional planning for forestry, agriculture and geotechnical projects.

AB  - The Tayuan (Cu-Mo)-Pb-Zn deposit is located in the northern part of Daxinganling, NE China. Lenticular ore body occurs in the skarn zone. The skarn minerals mainly include garnet, pyroxene, epidote and wollastonite. Electron microprobe analysis shows that the end member of garnet is mainly andradite (Ad(62-97)Gr(11-45)), the pyroxene is mainly diopside, and epidote is mainly clinozoisite. These characteristics indicate that the Tayuan polymetallic skarn deposit is mainly calcareous skarn. Sometimes the content zonation can be observed in garnets. With one garnet crystal, content is shifty from the core to the rim. In general, the iron content in the core is higher than in the edge. The content in the garnet shows that the garnet in the Tayuan deposit formed from weak oxidation in alkaline environment with the oxygen fugacity increasing, suggesting that the hydrothermal fluid evolved from an acidic to a slight alkaline state. In the Tayuan polymetallic deposit, the ratio of Mn/Fe in pyroxene is about 1.3, and of Mg/Fe, it is about 2. The components of garnet in the Tayuan deposit plot in the field of the typical skarn Zn, Cu, Mo deposits in the world.

AB  - The pigment spectra and the size structure of phytoplankton communities are considered as informative tools to assess the water quality in the context of the Descriptor 5 (Eutrophication) of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC). In this paper we analyse the phytoplankton assemblages in three sectors of the Adriatic Sea, the northernmost part of the Mediterranean, characterized by different trophic conditions and by variables highly correlated. Our main aim is to assess the environmental status of coastal waters by analysing the dependence of the Fp-ratio (index of trophic status by pigment signatures, Claustre in Limnol Oceanogr 39(5):1206-1210, 1994), from the total biomass and the cell size structure of the phytoplankton communities (Chlorophyll a), the salinity and the temperature of the Adriatic Sea via some variants of the partial least squares regression model (Durand in Chemometr Intell Lab Syst 58:235-246, 2001; Lombardo et al. in J Chemometr 23(12):605-617, 2009). The findings of the analysis confirm the utility of the Fp-ratio as indicator of the trophic status of the coastal waters.

AB  - The cost effective maintenance of underwater pressure pipes for sewage disposal in Austria requires the detection and localization of leakages. Extrusion of wastewater in lakes can heavily influence the water and bathing quality of surrounding waters. The Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology is a widely used technique for oil and gas pipeline leakage detection. While in pipeline leakage detection, fiber optic cables are installed permanently at the outside or within the protective sheathing of the pipe; this paper aims at testing the feasibility of detecting leakages with temporary introduced fiber optic cable inside the pipe. The detection and localization were tested in a laboratory experiment. The intrusion of water from leakages into the pipe, producing a local temperature drop, served as indicator for leakages. Measurements were taken under varying measurement conditions, including the number of leakages as well as the positioning of the fiber optic cable. Experiments showed that leakages could be detected accurately with the proposed methodology, when measuring resolution, temperature gradient and measurement time were properly selected. Despite the successful application of DTS for leakage detection in this lab environment, challenges in real system applications may arise from temperature gradients within the pipe system over longer distances and the placement of the cable into the real pipe system.

AB  - Accurate groundwater level (GWL) prediction can contribute to sustaining reliable water supply to domestic, agricultural and industrial uses as well as ecological services, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. In this paper, a regional GWL modeling framework was first presented through coupling both spatial and temporal clustering techniques. Specifically, the self-organizing map (SOM) was applied to identify spatially homogeneous clusters of GWL piezometers, while GWL time series forecasting was performed through developing a stepwise cluster multisite inference model with various predictors including climate conditions, well extractions, surface runoffs, reservoir operations and GWL measurements at previous steps. The proposed modeling approach was then demonstrated by a case of an arid irrigation district in the western Hexi Corridor, northwest China. Spatial clustering analysis identified 6 regionally representative central piezometers out of 30, for which sensitivity and uncertainty analysis were carried out regarding GWL predictions. As the stepwise cluster tree provided uncertain predictions, we added an AR(1) error model to the mean prediction to forecast GWL 1 month ahead. Model performance indicators suggest that the modeling system is a useful tool to aid decision-making for informed groundwater resource management in arid areas, and would have a great potential to extend its applications to more areas or regions in the future.

AB  - In four deep karstic lakes (Lake Vransko, Lake Visovacko, Kozjak and Prosce) several functionally well-adapted phytoplankton groups interchange in dominance during the seasonal cycle from April to September and likely tolerate the constraining conditions of nutrients deficiency more successfully as an aggregated group than as taxonomic units. This paper considers the functional approach by Reynolds et al. (2002), a method capturing much of the species ecology and which is successfully used for describing phytoplankton successions. Deep karstic lakes are attributed with the early spring (April) formation of stratification, low phytoplankton biomass, and with maximum biomass accumulating in July. The co-occurrence of functional groups in those lakes is evident but typically distinct according to different biomass proportions. The functional groups A, B, C, D, P, E and L-O, represented by different Cyclotella, Ulnaria/Fragilaria, Dinobryon, Ceratium/Peridinium species, co-occurred in 50 % and up to 90 % of phytoplankton biomass in all investigated lakes. By observing the co-occurrence across the Croatian karstic region we: (i) demonstrate the regional distribution of phytoplankton assemblages in relation to low nutrient environment, and (ii) build a simple uniform pattern which successfully describes a variety of phytoplankton in deep karstic lakes and provides information of reliable indicators for those systems.

AB  - The robustness of a range of watershed-scale "green" and "gray" drainage strategies in the future is explored through comprehensive modeling of a fully integrated urban wastewater system case. Four socio-economic future scenarios, defined by parameters affecting the environmental performance of the system, are proposed to account for the uncertain variability of conditions in the year 2050. A regret-based approach is applied to assess the relative performance of strategies in multiple impact categories (environmental, economic, and social) as well as to evaluate their robustness across future scenarios. The concept of regret proves useful in identifying performance trade-offs and recognizing states of the world most critical to decisions. The study highlights the robustness of green strategies (particularly rain gardens, resulting in half the regret of most options) over end-of-pipe gray alternatives (surface water separation or sewer and storage rehabilitation), which may be costly (on average, 25% of the total regret of these options) and tend to focus on sewer flooding and CSO alleviation while compromising on downstream system performance (this accounts for around 50% of their total regret). Trade-offs and scenario regrets observed in the analysis suggest that the combination of green and gray strategies may still offer further potential for robustness.

AB  - In this study we investigated collembolan communities using both taxonomy- and trait-based approaches in order to determine: (1) which soil or leaf litter characteristics are the main agents of species distribution and functional trait distribution in collembolan communities, and (2) which functional traits are more prevalent in species tolerant to urban environments. To investigate this, soil and leaf litter were sampled in the urban area of Naples, Italy and the collembolan community was analyzed using taxonomic and functional approaches. The results indicated that collembolan density was negatively affected by site pollution, and that species richness, diversity and evenness were positively affected by the organic matter content of the soil. Folsomia lawrencei was the most abundant species in sites with high metal contamination and low soil organic matter content, whereas Mesaphorura sp. and Parisotoma notabilis were the most ubiquitous taxa overall. The main agents affecting the frequency of functional traits were metal contamination of soil and litter, soil organic matter content, leaf specific mass and thickness of the litter. The species most tolerant to urban environmental conditions were found to have small body size, jumping motion strategy, sexual reproduction and presence of pigmentation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Future climate changes and the resulting modifications in anthropogenic activities will alter the interactions between rivers and groundwater. The quantification of these hydraulic interactions is absolutely necessary for achieving sustainable water use and requires accurate analytical methodologies. This report proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the quantitative and qualitative characterization of hydraulic interactions between rivers and shallow aquifers, wherein it outlines the advantages of coupling groundwater modeling with biological markers. As a first step, we built independent diagnostic maps of hydrological exchanges at the sector scale on the basis of hydrogeological modeling and biological indicators. In a second step, these maps were compared to provide a quantitative and qualitative understanding of exchanges between groundwater and surface water. This comparison significantly improved the calibration of groundwater models through a better assessment of boundary zones. Our approach enabled us to identify the conditions under which it could be possible to use biological indicators instead of a large set of piezometric measures. The integration of such combined tools in a future decision support system will assist governmental authorities in proposing appropriate long-term water policies for the preservation of groundwater resources, such as for supplying potable water and/or mitigating pollution risks.

AB  - The built environment is subjected to several pollutants under variable environmental conditions defined by diverse geochemical systems. These geochemical systems promote the occurrence of neoformations that can have a detrimental effect on surfaces of the building materials. Hence, the study of neoformations helps in the understanding of weathering processes that affect built structures. In the present paper we present a scanning electron microscopy study of macroscopic manifestations of neoformations detected during an extensive visual survey of several modern architectural works in urban areas of northern and central Portugal. The studies performed suggest that cementitious materials play an important role as a source of pollutants for the most common neoformations such as carbonate rich stains and coatings, as well as salt efflorescences of alkaline sulphates and carbonates. There are also indications of contributions from organic sources for alkaline nitrates and atmospheric pollution for gypsum-rich black crusts. Other less common neoformations include phosphate aggregates and silica stains that represent interesting indicators of the geochemical systems in built environments. In the case of carbonate-rich coatings, indications of recurrence related to the circulation of carbonate forming solutions relevant to the maintenance of built surfaces were detected.

AB  - The threat of damage to buildings and other infrastructures resulting from land subsidence associated with groundwater pumping in urbanized areas is an ongoing problem requiring assessment. An important goal of subsidence vulnerability assessment is to construct a composite subsidence vulnerability index (SVI) that is represented by a set of indicators that focuses on four different thematic factors: physical, social, economic, and environmental vulnerability. These indicators are evaluated on the basis of indicator selection principles and then weighted by their contribution rate to the overall index. The weights reflect different measures assigned to the township-specific conditions. A complete and composite subsidence vulnerability assessment is developed in which future vulnerability management decision-making processes can be readily made. The vulnerability assessment includes not only the construction of the SVI, which involves selecting, assigning value to, weighting, and aggregating the vulnerability indicators, but also the presentation of the SVI decomposition. Research results demonstrate that a composite subsidence vulnerability assessment method can be made by first constructing and then decomposition-presenting the overall SVI. This allows for the relative comparison of subsidence vulnerability and the identification of the main vulnerable indicators; thus providing subsidence risk, which represents an important step toward vulnerability management of water resources.

AB  - Weathervane scallops (Patinopecten caurinus) have been harvested commercially in Alaska since 1967. From the beginning, vessel operators in the eastern Gulf of Alaska have reported poor scallop adductor muscle quality characterized by tissue of stringy texture that tears easily during shucking. The Alaska scallop industry designates these scallops as "weak meats" and has difficulty marketing the product. Our research objective was to quantify variability in the quality of adductor muscle of Alaskan weathervane scallops. Physical measurements and chemical composition analyses were conducted for 2 groups of whole scallops from Yakutat (weak and standard) and 2 groups of scallop adductor muscles from Kodiak (Kodiak 1 and Kodiak 2). Moisture content was significantly higher (P<0.05) in weak than in standard adductor muscles. Glycogen content was similar (P>0.05) for standard, Kodiak 1, and Kodiak 2 adductor muscles, but was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in weak adductor muscles. Muscle condition indices were significantly lower (P<0.05) in weak than in standard adductor muscles. Results indicate that weak adductor muscle samples were lower in overall quality than the other 3 groups. Further investigation into the biological causes of weak adductor muscle in the eastern Gulf of Alaska scallops is warranted.

AB  - Sexually attractive characteristics are often thought to reflect an individual's condition or reproductive potential, but the underlying molecular mechanisms through which they do so are generally unknown. Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) is known to modulate aging, reproduction, and stress resistance in several species and to contribute to variability of these traits in natural populations. Here we show that IIS determines sexual attractiveness in Drosophila through transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the production of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC), many of which function as pheromones. Using traditional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) together with newly introduced laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) we establish that CHC profiles e significantly affected by genetic manipulations that target IIS. Manipulations that reduce IIS also reduce attractiveness, while females with increased IIS are significantly more attractive than wild-type animals. IIS effects on attractiveness are mediated by changes in CHC profiles. Insulin signaling influences CHC through pathways that are likely independent of dFOXO and that may involve the nutrient-sensing Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway. These results suggest that the activity of conserved molecular regulators of longevity and reproductive output may manifest in different species as external characteristics that are perceived as honest indicators of fitness potential.

AB  - Researchers employing resource selection functions (RSFs) and other related methods aim to detect correlates of space-use and mitigate against detrimental environmental change. However, an empirical model fit to data from one place or time is unlikely to capture species responses under different conditions because organisms respond nonlinearly to changes in habitat availability. This phenomenon, known as a functional response in resource selection, has been debated extensively in the RSF literature but continues to be ignored by practitioners for lack of a practical treatment. We therefore extend the RSF approach to enable it to estimate generalized functional responses (GFRs) from spatial data. GFRs employ data from several sampling instances characterized by diverse profiles of habitat availability. By modeling the regression coefficients of the underlying RSF as functions of availability, GFRs can account for environmental change and thus predict population distributions in new environments. We formulate the approach as a mixed-effects model so that it is estimable by readily available statistical software. We illustrate its application using (1) simulation and (2) wolf home-range telemetry. Our results indicate that GFRs can offer considerable improvements in estimation speed and predictive ability over existing mixed-effects approaches.

AB  - Binocular rivalry occurs when conflicting images are presented in corresponding locations of the two eyes. Perception alternates between the images at a rate that is relatively stable within individuals but that varies widely between individuals. The determinants of this variation are unknown. In addition, slow binocular rivalry has been demonstrated in bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition with high heritability. The present study therefore examined whether there is a genetic contribution to individual variation in binocular rivalry rate. We employed the twin method and studied both monozygotic (MZ) twins (n = 128 pairs) who are genetically identical, and dizygotic (DZ) twins (n = 220 pairs) who share roughly half their genes. MZ and DZ twin correlations for binocular rivalry rate were 0.51 and 0.19, respectively. The best-fitting genetic model showed 52% of the variance in binocular rivalry rate was accounted for by additive genetic factors. In contrast, nonshared environmental influences accounted for 18% of the variance, with the remainder attributed to measurement error. This study therefore demonstrates a substantial genetic contribution to individual variation in binocular rivalry rate. The results support the vigorous pursuit of genetic and molecular studies of binocular rivalry and further characterization of slow binocular rivalry as an endophenotype for bipolar disorder.

AB  - Nitrogen content in crop leaf is an important indication for evaluating crop health and predicting crop yield. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is widely used as an indicator in estimating leaf nitrogen content in practice. How to effectively and accurately measure the NDVI value of crop leaves in the field is a challenge on in-field use instrument development. This paper reports the development of a hand-held spectroscopy-based optical sensing device for measuring crop leaf NDVI values under in-field natural light conditions. This optical sensing device could simultaneously measure the spectral reflectance of canopies and the solar intensity at two bands of 610 and 1220 nm, and calculate NDVI value in real-time based on measured spectral reflectance. This device was tested in tomato plants chlorophyll content measurement. A series of field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the sensor, and tomato leaf samples were collected for measuring chlorophyll contents as the reference for validation. Obtained results indicated that NDVI values measured with this sensing device had a close correlation with chlorophyll contents of the collected leaf samples measured in laboratory with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (R-Opt(2) = 0.66).

TI  - Development of lightweight aggregate from dry sewage sludge and coal ash
T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - In this study, dry sewage sludge (DSS) as the principal material was blended with coal ash (CA) to produce lightweight aggregate. The effects of different raw material compositions and sintering temperatures on the aggregate properties were then evaluated. In addition, an environmental assessment of the lightweight aggregate generated was conducted by analyzing the fixed rate of heavy metals in the aggregate, as well as their leaching behavior. The results indicated that using DSS enhanced the pyrolysis-volatilization reaction due to its high organic matter content, and decreased the bulk density and sintering temperature. However, the sintered products of un-amended DSS were porous and loose due to the formation of large pores during sintering. Adding CA improved the sintering temperature while effectively decreasing the pore size and increasing the compressive strength of the product. Furthermore, the sintering temperature and the proportion of CA were found to be the primary factors affecting the properties of the sintered products, and the addition of 18-25% of CA coupled with sintering at 1100 degrees C for 30 min produced the highest quality lightweight aggregates. in addition, heavy metals were fixed inside products generated under these conditions and the As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn concentrations of the leachate were found to be within the limits of China's regulatory requirements.

AB  - Sensory systems must be able to extract features of environmental cues within the context of the different physiological states of the organism and often temper their activity in a state-dependent manner via the process of neuromodulation. We examined the effects of the neuromodulator serotonin on a well-characterized sensory circuit, the antennal lobe of Drosophila melanogaster, using two-photon microscopy and the genetically expressed calcium indicator, G-CaMP. Serotonin enhances sensitivity of the antennal lobe output projection neurons in an odor-specific manner. For odorants that sparsely activate the antennal lobe, serotonin enhances projection neuron responses and causes an offset of the projection neuron tuning curve, most likely by increasing projection neuron sensitivity. However, for an odorant that evokes a broad activation pattern, serotonin enhances projection neuron responses in some, but not all, glomeruli. Further, serotonin enhances the responses of inhibitory local interneurons, resulting in a reduction of neurotransmitter release from the olfactory sensory neurons via GABA(B) receptor-dependent presynaptic inhibition, which may be a mechanism underlying the odorant-specific modulation of projection neuron responses. Our data suggest that the complexity of serotonin modulation in the antennal lobe accommodates coding stability in a glomerular pattern and flexible projection neuron sensitivity under different physiological conditions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of treated wastewater for horticultural crops, assess the effects of continuous use of treated water on soil and crops, and analyse the physical, chemical and biological effects of irrigation with recycled water. Two lettuce plots watered with drinking water and treated wastewater were monitored over a three year period. Nutrients, heavy metal and the dynamics of pathogen and indicator microorganism content in soil and foliar tissues were analysed. Wastewater irrigation had a high influence on soil parameters: organic matter, N, P, Ca, Al, Fe, Pb and Zn. Indicator and pathogenic microorganisms were detected in soil and plants grown in the wastewater-irrigated plot, and persisted in the soil for 27 days during the study under humid conditions. N, P, Pb and Al content were significantly higher in plant tissues of wastewater-irrigated plots than in the control after 3 years of irrigation. Harvest was significantly higher in the wastewater-irrigated plot. Wastewater can be a resource for agricultural irrigation. In any case, the possible heavy metal accumulation in soils and presence of pathogenic organisms require careful management of this alternative resource: use of a drip irrigation system, previous wastewater disinfection and a limited irrigation period are recommended.

AB  - Cytochrome p450 1A (cyp1A), pigmented macrophage aggregate (PMA) variables and fish descriptive characteristics were measured in field-caught adult carp Cyprinus carpio from two upstream reference sites and two downstream Superfund sites contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Kalamazoo River, MI, U.S.A. Liver PCB content in fish differed among sites, and immunocytochemical cyp1A protein expression was significantly elevated in fish liver at contaminated sites and with liver PCBs. PMA number (number per mm(2)), mean size [mean size (area) per mm(2)] and percentage area occupied (total area of PMAs per total field area evaluated) were significantly greater in fish livers from the contaminated sites. PMA number was significantly greater at one contaminated site, Lake Allegan, than at the Trowbridge Dam impoundment, the other contaminated site. The level of cyp1A protein was significantly correlated with PMA mean size and PMA per cent area but not with PMA number. These results suggest that carp are responding to PCB contamination and point to complex site dynamics related to fish condition in the Kalamazoo River.

AB  - Trace metal levels in the otoliths of the juvenile chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta were examined by means of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). Life history transect analyses showed that all otoliths had a central region with low Zn/Ca ratios (mean, 0.35-0.68 x 10(-4)), and thereafter the ratios increased abruptly in the freshwater growth zone (mean: 1.72-1.90 x 10(-4)) toward the edge of otolith. In regard to otolith Sr/Ca ratios, all specimens showed slightly higher values in the otolith core region, and thereafter the ratios showed constant values or values that decreased gradually toward the edge of the otolith in the freshwater growth zone (mean, 3.33-4.58 x 10(-3)). An abrupt increase was found in some specimens to 5-7 x 10(-3) in the maximum levels around the otolith edge. The relationship between Sr/Ca and Zn/Ca ratios at each ablation in otoliths in both juvenile and adult salmons showed a significant correlation. Otolith Zn/Ca and Sr/Ca ratio patterns were seen to reflect the levels in ambient water environment. Thus, these findings indicate that Zn, like Sr, in teleost otoliths is an excellent tracer for reconstructing the ambient aquatic environmental conditions which individual fish have experienced.

AB  - Results of environmental risk assessments based merely on toxic effects of contaminants at the individual level, without consideration of population-level effects, may be questionable. The aim of the present study was to investigate how limited food resources, resulting in. intraspecific competition, could interact with the chronic effect of short-term contamination with the insecticide esfenvalerate. Larvae of the mayfly, Cloeon dipterum, were exposed to esfenvalerate (0.00 1 - 100 mu g/L) for 1 h and then transferred to indoor microcosms containing insecticide-free water, where they were maintained at various food levels until emergence. The results showed that short-term exposure to 10 or 100 mu g/L resulted in acute mortality. Chronic effects on survival occurred at concentrations up to three orders of magnitude lower than that causing the acute effect (0.01 mu g/L). Food limitation increased effects on organisms during medium-term observation (8-15 d), but assessment of long-term survival rates suggested that the chronic effects of low insecticide concentrations could be compensated for, at least regarding some endpoints. The authors assume that in limited-food conditions, lethal and sublethal effects reduced competition between individuals, resulting in significantly increased final survival.

AB  - The excavation in the 1890s of a skeleton of the warm-water marine mammal Dugong dugon, associated with Aboriginal artefacts, from a Botany Bay salt marsh, marked the beginning of speculation about climate and sea level change in Australia over the period of human occupation. The dugong bones have recently been dated, giving a conventional C-14 age of 5520 +/- 70 years BP, which is consistent with three older C-14 dates for a layer of buried trees that underlies much of the north Botany sediments. The carefully drawn cross-sections of depositional strata produced by the original discoverers allow further interpretation of the pattern of Holocene sea-level fluctuations in the Sydney region. Layers of estuarine sediment, such as the one containing the dugong skeleton, are inter-bedded with peat layers containing in situ roots and stumps, suggesting that the site alternated between sub-aerial exposure and submergence throughout the Holocene. The presence of the dugong is suggestive of warmer conditions, and its inland location indicates a more extensive Botany Bay in the recent past. This is in agreement with other work from southern New South Wales describing both warm-water marine species and higher sea levels several thousand years ago.

AB  - Cluster and principal component analysts of Toarcian-Aalenian microfossils from a uniform Fleckenmergel facies, found in two different parts of the Pieniny Klippen Basin have been undertaken on the basis of the percentage abundance of benthic foraminifers and the standardized number of all microfossils per 100-grams of sediment. The latter type of input data appeared to separate two paleobathymetric settings much better than relative benthic foraminiferal data alone. Comparison of the foraminiferal assemblages with fossil and recent analogues suggests: not so strong paleodepth differences within the basin ranging from the middle/outer neritic for the Czorsztyn and thr outer neritic and/or upper bathyal for the Branisko Zone. The shallower part of the basin is dominated by Spirillina associated with other epibenthic foraminifers, enhanced abundance of ostracods, crinoid and other echinoderm fragment:;. Higher abundance of crinoid fragments and sponge spicules within the shallower (Czorsztyn) zone suggests a slightly higher energetic environment with very weak bottom currents. Predominance of nodosariids associated with tubular agglutinated foraminifers (astrorhizids), as well as lower abundance of benthic foraminifers and ostracods linked to a higher abundance of radiolaria are supposed to indicate deeper basinal settings. These distributional trends are most likely related to trophic conditions, and only indirectly to the paleobathymetry of the basin.

AB  - Spatial and temporal patterns of concentration of chlorophyll a as an indicator of phytoplanktic biomass were evaluated in Pom-Atasta, a fluvial-deltaic system linked to Terminos Lagoon in the Campeche coast, Mexico. The seasonal, regional, nichthemeral and vertical variation patterns were studied and related with environmental conditions. An annual cycle was analyzed in the system, including sampling at two water levels (surface and bottom) in constrasting sites by their saline regime. Time series of 24 hours were performed in sites with more hydrological variation. Spectrophotometric technics were used to quantify the concentration of chlorophyll a. The highest concentrations were present during the dry season with an average of 19.86 mg m(-3), and the lowest concentrations were during the rainy season with an average of 3 mg m(-3). The total mean in the annual cycle was 13.25 mg m(-3) in the surface and 15.5 mg m(-3) in the bottom. Regional pattern in pigment concentrations was observed, with the highest values in the site of lower tide influence. A great range of variation in chlorophyll concentrations was evident within the annual cycle and in different regions of the system. This patterns of variation seems to be closely related with the hydrological changes resulting of the input balance of tidal waters. rainfall and fresh water discharges.

AB  - The triacylglycerols and fatty acids of Fucus serratus were analysed during the course of a year. The amount of triacylglycerols was maximal in July (19.2% total lipids), but minimal in February (6.6%). Triacylglycerols accumulated more in summer (2.8 mg g(-1) dry wt) and autumn (2.6 mg g(-1) dry wt) than spring (0.7 mg g(-1) dry wt) and winter (0.5 mg g(-1) dry wt). In the total lipids, the dominant fatty acids were palmitic (16:0, 24.1%), oleic (18:1, 22.4%) and arachidonic (20:4, 14.4%), but in the triacylglycerols, palmitic 16:0 (22.8%), oleic 18:1 (36.4%) and linoleic acids (18:2, 16.4%) were most abundant. C-16 fatty acids were predominant in winter and C-18 ones in summer and autumn. The ratios 16:0/18:1 and 20:4/20:5 appeared to be important indicators of the status of the seaweed according to variation of environmental conditions. We conclude that, although the emersion of F. serratus in situ is more effective during winter and spring, correlating with good growth and productivity of thalli, synthesis of triacylglycerols is activated during the summer.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel has drawn growing attention towards the utilization of renewable biomass for sustainable energy production. Technologies for the production of algae derived biofuel has attracted wide attention in recent years. Direct thermochemical conversion of algae obtained biocrude oil with poor fuel quality due to the complex composition of algae. Thus, catalysts are required in such process to remove the heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. This article reviews the recent advances in catalytic systems for the direct catalytic conversion of algae, as well as catalytic upgrading of algae-derived oil or biocrude into liquid fuels with high quality. Heterogeneous catalysts with high activity in deoxygenation and denitrogenation are preferable for the conversion of algae oil to high-grade liquid fuel. The paper summarized the influence of reaction parameters and reaction routes for the catalytic conversion process of algae from critical literature. The development of new catalysts, conversion conditions, and efficiency indicators (yields and selectivity) from different literature are presented and compared. The future prospect and challenges in general utilization of algae are also proposed.

AB  - Regional identity in project culture is rooted in historical and ethno-cultural traditions. This actualizes the identification of the architectonic asset of the Place. The author considers place architectonics as an integral concept taking into account natural and cultural-historical values of the territory. Field study of the architectonic space of the cultural landscape of the Nizhny-Arkhyz historical-architectural and archaeological complex formed the basis of the research. It shows that the architectonics of Place of the Nizhny-Arkhyz complex, conditioned by the attractive properties of the landscape and identical cultural and historical code, finds its concentrated expression. The architectonic space of the Nizhny Arkhyz ensemble is a place of semantization of historical artifacts, where various cultural contexts interact. The architectonics of Place of Nizhny-Arkhyz manifested itself on three levels (spatial, informational and systematic), contains valuable landscape, cultural-historical and phenomenological expressions of the Place and possesses historical memory. Positioning of the Nizhny-Arkhyz complex as an important tourist resource and expansion of its social and cultural functions and social role in relation to the "Alan Christian center" creation requires solution of scientific, design and restoration tasks, as well as the use of modern museum communications and representation of cultural forms in the landscape

AB  - Asian cold-based glacier yeasts with respect to their abundance, distribution, and taxonomy, in contrast to other continental cryosphere areas, have been little investigated. The present study reports the diversity and phylogeny of culturable cold-adapted yeasts in six cold habitats of the Glacier No.1 in the Tianshan Mountains (northwestern China). Of the total 591 yeast isolates, 401 were identified as basidiomycetous yeasts represented by 41 species of 15 genera, while 190 ascomycetous yeast isolates were assigned to the 8 species of 7 genera. The most prevalent species was Candida akabanensis with a 19.8% frequency of occurrence, followed by Vishniacozyma victoriae (16.4%) and Diutina rugosa (9.98%), of which V. victoriae was the only yeast species common to all six glacial habitats. Variability on the component and abundance of yeast taxa among glacial habitats primarily displayed in four dominant yeast genera, namely Candida, Vishniacozyma, Filobasidium, and Naganishia. However, network analysis illustrated that most of 32 rare yeast populations were habitat-specific, implying that the low-abundance yeast population was more easily influenced by the local habitat conditions (species sorting). Based on indicator species analyses, the subglacial habitat was characterized by psychrotolerant and/or psychrophilic yeast taxa.

AB  - Phytoplankton in shallow lakes will expectedly respond to climate warming and the response may differ between macrophyte and non-macrophyte lakes. To test the responses of phytoplankton to elevated temperature (+ 4.5 degrees C) at genus and functional group level, we conducted a 60-day experiment with and without the presence of Potamogeton crispus in the winter of Wuhan, China. When P. crispus was present, elevated temperature had little or no effect on the biomass and composition of the phytoplankton community. In the absence of P. crispus, however, elevated temperature significantly decreased the biomass and changed the composition of the phytoplankton. In contrast to many but not all published results mainly conducted during spring and summer, elevated temperature in winter reduced rather than increased the dominance of Cyanophyta. Instead, Chlorophyta became dominant. Redundancy analyses (RDA) showed that conductivity, light intensity and the ammonium/nitrate ratio (NH4:NO3) were the most important environmental variables, accounting for almost similar parts of the variations recorded in both genus and functional group composition. Among treatments, functional models did not show advantages over taxonomic models in depicting the response of the phytoplankton assemblage to the environmental conditions prevailing in our study conducted in winter, characterised by low phytoplankton abundance.

AB  - On-site rapid monitoring of nitrite as an assessment indicator of the environment, food, and physiological systems has drawn extensive attention. Here, electrokinetic stacking (ES) was combined with colorimetric reaction on a paper-based device (PAD) to achieve colorless nitrite detection with smartphone. In this paper, nitrite was stacked on the paper fluidic channel as a narrow band by electrokinetic stacking. Then, Griess reagent was introduced to visualize the stacking band. Under optimal conditions, the sensitivity of nitrite was 160-fold increased within 5 min. A linear response in the range of 0.075 to 1.0 mu g mL(-1) (R (2) = 0.99) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 73 ng mL(-1) (0.86 mu M) were obtained. The LOD was 10 times lower than the reported PAD, and close to that achieved by a desktop spectrophotometer. The applicability was demonstrated by nitrite detection from saliva and water with good selectivity, adding 100 times more concentrated co-ions. High recovery (91.0 similar to 108.7%) and reasonable intra-day and inter-day reproducibility (RSD < 9%) were obtained. This work shows that the sensitivity of colorless analyte detection-based colorimetric reaction can be effectively enhanced by integration of ES on a PAD.

AB  - Pearl mullet (Alburnus tarichi Gilldenstalt, 1814) is an endemic fish species living in the Lake Van basin. Lakes Van and Ercek are soda lakes which have alkaline and brackish properties. Pearl mullet migrate to freshwater streams surrounding these lakes for spawning and return back to the lake environment after reproduction. Migration takes places from the lakes into freshwater streams and the fish are exposed to 2 different environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to assess erythrocyte osmotic fragility, a test providing information about the membrane stability of erythrocytes and the physiological strength of erythrocytes against physicochemical stress, during spawning migration. For this purpose, blood samples were collected into EDTA containing tubes from fish sampled from Lake Ercek and a freshwater environment pouring into the lake (Memedik Stream). Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was performed on the collected blood samples. The results indicated a significant increase in erythrocyte osmotic fragility at 0.4 and 0.5% NaCl concentrations for freshwater stream samples. It can be concluded that the increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility in the freshwater environment was causally related to physicochemical changes. Further research can be conducted on physiological mechanisms that cause this observed change in erythrocyte fragility which is an indicator of membrane stability.

AB  - The plant microbiome is a key determinant of plant health. Less is known about the phyllosphere microbiota and its driving factors in built environments. To study the variability of the microbiome in relation to plant genotype and climate under different controlled conditions, we investigated 14 phylogenetically diverse plant species grown in the greenhouses of the Botanical Garden in Graz (Austria). All investigated plants showed specific bacterial abundances of up to 10(6) CFU cm(-2) on their leaves. Bacterial diversity (H-': 2.4-7.9) and number of putative OTUs (461-2013) were strongly plant species dependent. Statistical analysis showed a significantly higher correlation of community composition to plant genotype in comparison to the ambient climatic variables. In addition to the microbiome structure, we studied the antagonistic potential towards the foliar pathogen Botrytis cinerea as functional indicator. A high proportion of isolates (up to 58%) were able to inhibit pathogen growth by production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Data of structure and function were linked: frequently isolated VOCs producers (e.g. Bacillus and Stenotrophomonas) were highly present in phyllosphere communities, which were dominated by members of Firmicutes. This study indicates that indoor ornamentals feature a distinct, stable microbiota on leaves irrespective of the indoor climate.

AB  - About 1% of New Zealand farmland is managed organically. Nitrogen is the nutrient most likely to limit organic crop production. A potential solution is incorporation of compost to supply N. About 726,000 t of municipal garden and kitchen wastes are sent to landfills annually. Composting offers a means of reducing the impact of landfill wastes on the wider environment. Organically certified compost (N content typically 2% to 2.5%) is available from some municipal composting plants. To be effectively used on organic farms, the rate of N release (mineralization) must be known. Laboratory incubations were conducted to quantify mineralization of compost N under controlled (temperature and moisture) conditions. Nitrogen availability and crop yields from a one-off application of compost (25-100 tha(-1)) were also assessed in two field trials (using cereal and forage crops). The results suggested that a relatively small part (13%-23%) of compost N was used by the crops in 3-4 years. Much of this was mineral N present at the time of application. Mineralization rates in the laboratory and field studies were much lower than expected from published work or compost C:N ratio (considered an important indicator of N mineralization potential of composts).

AB  - Triterpenoid saponins (TSs) are the most important components of some traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) and have exhibited valuable pharmacological properties. In this study, a rapid and efficient method was developed for the separation of kudinosides, stauntosides and ginsenosides using supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with single quadrupole mass spectrometry (SFC-MS). The separation conditions for the selected TSs were carefully optimized after the initial screening of eight stationary phases. The best compromise for all compounds in terms of chromatographic performance and MS sensitivity was obtained when water (5-10%) and formic acid (0.05%) were added to the supercritical carbon dioxide/MeOH mobile phase. Beside the composition of the mobile phase, the nature of the make-up solvent for interfacing SFC with MS was also evaluated. Compared to reversed phase liquid chromatography, the SFC approach showed higher resolution and shorter running time. The developed SFC-MS methods were successfully applied to the separation and identification of TSs present in Hex latifolia Thunb., Panax quinquefolius L. and Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer. These results suggest that this SFC-MS approach could be employed as a useful tool for the quality assessment of natural products containing TSs as active components. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dreissena polymorpha is a widespread filter-feeder species, resistant to a broad range of environmental conditions and different types of pollutants, which has recently colonized Italian freshwaters. Although widely used to monitor pollution in freshwater environments, this species is also an important food source for some fish and water birds. It can also be used to concentrate or remove particulate organic matter to interrupt avian-to-human transmission of pollutants and control health risks for animals and humans. In this study, the accumulation/inactivation in D. polymoipha of human health-related spiked enteric viruses was described. The removal of endogenous Escherichia coli, the classical indicator of fecal contamination, was tested as well. Our preliminary lab-scale results demonstrate that zebra mussels can reduce significantly poliovirus titer after 24 h and rotavirus titer after 8 h. E. coli counts were also reduced in the presence of zebra mussels by about 1.5 log after 4 hand nearly completely after 24 h. The fate of the two enteric viruses after concentration by zebra mussels was also investigated after mechanical disruption of the tissues. To our knowledge, the accumulation from water and inactivation of human health-related enteric viruses by zebra mussels has never been reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In frame of an cooperative research project the model SYNOPS to assess environmental risk of plant protection measurements has been successfully applied for evaluation of three chemical plant protection strategies in sugar beet growing tested in field experiments at 9 respectively 10 sites in 2008 and 2009.
   The assessment has shown relative advantages of the "Minimal dosage strategy" with a high number of pesticides against a "Common practice strategy" with a smaller number of pesticides and common dose rates and a "Registered strategy" with very few pesticides applied with the registered application dose. But all calculated risk indices for earthworms are below the neglect-limit where negative effect can be excluded with high confidence. The same has been found out for water organisms if the pesticide specific application requirements regarding buffer zones are complied with. The results of the field investigations regarding effects on earthworms have confirmed the results of model SYNOPS.
   Simulation of the tested strategies on all sugar beet fields in 5 large regions in Germany and the comparison with strategies in practice of these regions by means GIS-technology has shown their environmental soundness in general. Only very few calculated risk indices for algae were above the neglect-limit caused by extremely unfavourable application conditions. Whether there is a real risk should be investigated in further hot-spot analysis.

AB  - Chydorids (Cladocera, Chydoridae) have two reproductive strategies: asexual reproduction that prevails during favorable environmental conditions and sexual reproduction that is induced by environmental stimuli associated with seasonal or aperiodic environmental stresses. These modes of reproduction can be recognized in the subfossil sedimentary records as parthenogenetic shells of females (asexual reproduction) and by ephippia (sexual reproduction). We studied the interrelations between subfossil chydorid ephippia and environmental variables by analyzing surface sediment samples obtained from 76 Finnish lakes across a latitudinal gradient (60-70 degrees N). The results showed that the total chydorid ephippia (TCE) increases along the climate gradient from similar to 2 to 3% in the south to similar to 25% in the north and suggested a significant dependence (r similar to -0.8, P < 0.001) with several climate factors, especially that of mean July air temperature. We used this relationship to create a model for reconstructing past mean July air temperatures. A linear regression of the log(10) transformed TCE as a single independent variable explained 76% (SE +/- 0.76 degrees C) of the variance of the observed mean July air temperatures. Accordingly, we propose that this novel tool may be highly suitable for reconstructing paleotemperatures in cold-temperate environments.

AB  - Birds breeding in cold environments regularly have to interrupt incubation to forage, causing a trade-off between two mutually exclusive behaviours. Earlier studies showed that uniparental Arctic sandpipers overall spend less time incubating their eggs than biparental species, but interspecific differences in size and ecology were potential confounding factors. This study reports on a within-species comparison of breeding schedules and metal egg temperatures in uni- and biparental sanderlings (Calidris alba) in Northeast Greenland in relation to ambient temperature. We recorded incubation schedules with nest temperature loggers in 34 sanderling clutches (13 uniparentals, 21 biparentals). The temperature of a metal egg placed within the clutch of 17 incubating birds (6 uniparentals, 9 biparentals) was measured as an indicator of the heat put into eggs. Recess frequency, recess duration and total recess time were higher in uniparentals than in biparentals and positively correlated with ambient temperatures in uniparentals only. Uniparental sanderlings maintained significantly higher metal egg temperatures during incubation than biparentals (1.4 degrees C difference on average). Our results suggest that uniparental sanderlings compensate for the lower nest attendance, which may prolong the duration of the incubation period and negatively affect the condition of the hatchlings, by maintaining a higher heat flux into the eggs.

AB  - Musty odors, often associated with damp or water-damaged buildings, originate from the release of microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) from mold growing on building materials and construction substrates. Chemical analysis of air samples is a feasible way to supplement conventional bioaerosol techniques during building investigations. Analytical methodologies for MVOCs are straightforward; however, development of a scientifically validated method to measure unique MVOCs that indicate with high confidence the presence of hidden mold regardless of the amount of mold present remains a challenge.
   Laboratory studies identified and quantified specific MVOCs associated with various mold species and MVOCs generated by specific molds growing on selected building materials in simulated, realistic conditions.
   This research determined that numerous MVOCs are released from active mold growth and are dependent on both the type of mold and the host substrate. MVOC profiles generated by 32 combinations of various molds and materials were determined, but only a Jew of these compounds demonstrated effectiveness in field/building studies. Certain mold-selective MVOCs were identified as potential indicators for specific mold, including methoxybenzene for Stachybotrys chartarum and benzothiazole and menthol for Chaetomium globosum. These studies provided a firm foundation for continued research of mold-specific MVOC markers as indicators of hidden mold and as predictors of potential mold sources in problem buildings.

AB  - Predicting environmental impacts is essential when performing an environmental assessment on urban transport planning. System dynamics (SD) is usually used to solve complex nonlinear problems. In this study, we utilized system dynamics (SD) to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with urban transport planning in Jilin City, China with respect to the local economy, society, transport, the environment and resources. To accomplish this, we generated simulation models comprising interrelated subsystems designed to utilize changes in the economy, society, road construction, changes in the number of vehicles, the capacity of the road network capacity, nitrogen oxides emission, traffic noise, land used for road construction and fuel consumption associated with traffic to estimate dynamic trends in the environmental impacts associated with Jilin's transport planning. Two simulation scenarios were then analyzed comparatively. The results of this study indicated that implementation of Jilin transport planning would improve the current urban traffic conditions and boost the local economy and development while benefiting the environment in Jilin City. In addition, comparative analysis of the two scenarios provided additional information that can be used to aid in scientific decision-making regarding which aspects of the transport planning to implement in Jilin City. This study demonstrates that our application of the SD method, which is referred to as the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), is feasible for use in urban transport planning.

AB  - The aim of this research is to define a new Macrophyte Index relevant in the context of the Po Valley. The application of biotic indexes, as the macrophyte ones, is required by both the Italian and the European law to provide an adequate classification of freshwaters, in association with physical-chemical and hydromorphological data. At the same time, these methodologies, based on the sensibility of macrophytes towards pollution, could be an important mean to evaluate the quality of the waters coming from wetlands, providing information related to the depuration capabilities of these important ecotonal zones. In this study, we elaborate a floristic list of about 340 taxa; moreover, we chose 19 sampling sites, analysed physical-chemical parameters and obtained floristic data. These results, integrated by literature information on ecological needs, distribution and rarity of all species, allowed the attribution of indicator values. Thus, two new indexes have been elaborated: Indice Macrofitico di Pianura (I.M.P.), mostly accounting for water quality, and Indice di Biodiversita Riparia (I.B.R.), mostly accounting for biodiversity of macrophytes on the banks. The efficacy of the proposed indexes has been evaluated by comparing them to analysed physical-chemical parameters and other indexes used in Europe, such as Macrophyte Index Scheme (M.I.S), Indice Biologique Macrophytique en Riviere (I.B.M.R.) and Extended Biotic Index (I.B.E.).

AB  - Over the last decade and a half various aspects of the sustainability of food production have been evaluated by different groups of stakeholders. National and federal legislators have looked at the types of chemicals allowed and the acceptable maximum residue levels permitted for particular crops and conditions. Commercial firms (in both the processing and retail sectors) have developed private company labels that distinguish them from competitors. Their suppliers have to comply under a 'licence to deliver'. Some organizations that are concerned with environmental issues have developed guidelines. Finally, producer organizations have developed their own labels. The assumption is that farmers who comply have products with added value, which give rise to better opportunities to sell. Some processors source only from growers complying with such schemes. This paper highlights past endeavours, rules and tools to assure food safety, and present initiatives to bring sustainability into the pre-competitive domain. It also identifies future requirements for sustainability indicators and baseline studies, and demonstrates the need to move from indicator values to target values. This approach allowsfor the quantitative monitoring of environmental safety that will be required for the food industry of the future, just as food safety is now and was in the past.

AB  - For all new pharmaceuticals, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has to be performed according to guidelines developed by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency. An important factor of this procedure is the assessment of the predicted environmental concentration in the aquatic environment, which is significantly influenced by the biodegradability of pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants. Established standardized methods for determining biodegradation under laboratory conditions apply to substance concentrations, which are much higher than those expected in reality. Against this background, the laboratory scale sewage treatment plant (LSSTP), as described by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guideline No. 303A, was modified to construct a lossless system, which allows laboratory testing at realistic concentrations. To verify the experimental setup, the antibiotics benzylpenicillin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim were tested at low concentrations (mu g/L) using C-14-labeled compounds. The results show that approximately 25% of benzylpenicillin was mineralized, whereas ceftriaxone and trimethoprim were not mineralized at all. Due to the high total recoveries of added radioactivity (>= 95%) and the fact that the findings comply with available literature data, the lossless operation of the test system could be proved. Consequently, the modified LSSTP is a suitable tool to determine more realistic biodegradation data required for the exposure assessment within the scope of an ERA for pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Chrysophyte algae produce siliceous resting stages (stomatocysts) that are indicators of past environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to assess their strength for climate reconstructions. Stomatocysts were collected using sediment traps exposed in 45 mountain lakes (1502-2309 m a.s.l., Austrian Alps). Bihourly water-temperature measurements were used to determine dates of freezing and break-up, spring and autumn mixing. Canonical correspondence analyses revealed that the stomatocyst assemblages were related to the dates of ice break-up and spring mixing. The two dates are controlled by winter/spring air temperature. We developed a weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) stomatocyst/date-of-spring-mixing regression and calibration model (R-boot(2) = 0.85), and reconstructed 'dates of spring mixing' for Jezero v Ledvici (1824 m a.s.l., Slovenian Alps) from AD 1842 to 1996. Sample-specific standard errors of prediction corresponded to 0.6 degrees C - 1.0 degrees C. Despite dating uncertainties and poor fits of fossil assemblages with the training set, reconstructed 'dates of spring mixing' were significantly correlated with the mean March-April air temperature, which is known to drive break-up dates. Furthermore, the record was in agreement with glacier advances during the Little Ice Age.

AB  - Aims: To test the hypothesis that faecal coliform (FC) and phosphorus (P) are transported similarly in surface runoff through the vegetative filter strip after being released from land-applied manure.
   Methods and Results: The Hagerstown soil was packed into boxes that were 10 cm deep, 30 cm wide and 100, 200 or 300 cm long. Grass was grown in boxes prior experiments. Same-length boxes were placed under rainfall simulator and tilted to have with either 2% or 4% slopes. Dairy manure was broadcast on the upper 30-cm section. Rainfall was simulated and runoff samples were collected and analysed for Cl, FC and total phosphorus (TP). Mass recovery, the concentration decrease rate k, and the ratio FC : TP showed that there was a consistent relationship between FC and TP in runoff.
   Conclusion: The FC and TP transport through simulated vegetated buffer strips were highly correlated.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: As a knowledge base on the effect of the environmental parameters on P transport in vegetated buffer strips is substantially larger than for manure-borne bacteria, the observed similarity may enhance ability to assess the efficiency of the vegetated buffer strips in retention of FC currently used as indicator organisms for manure-borne pathogens.

AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) offers the potential to improve the efficiency and environmental impact of conventional crop production systems. However. its implementation will depend on perceptions of how the adoption of technology will increase their yields and profit. and lower their production risk. This article presents an approach to help with this type of decision making. In this instance the consequences of three management scenarios (no lime, single-rate liming and site-specific lime applications to acidic field soil) were assessed in terms of production and economic risks. The methodology involved modelling the uncertainty about wheat yield., accounting for the local uncertainties about soil pH and lime requirement, and the uncertainties about crop model parameters used in the simulations. Indicator kriging (IK) was used together with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) of the probability distributions of variables and model parameters for the propagation of uncertainties through to the output yield and net profit maps. These maps, together with a sensitivity analysis, were used to aid with decision making. Comparison of the three scenarios showed that, under the economic conditions of the analysis. the optimum was reached for a single-rate application of 3.5 Mg/ha over the entire field instead of site-specific lime applications.

AB  - Biochemical biomarkers measure the exposure of organisms to environmental chemicals. They can also provide measures of toxic effect, e.g. where they are based on molecular mechanisms which underly toxicity. Ideally, biomarkers should be sensitive, specific, simple to use and suitable for the assay of material obtained by non-destructive sampling procedures (e.g. of blood). Recently, there has been encouraging progress in the development of several different types of biomarker assays: (1) The measurement of inhibition of serum 'B' esterases to monitor exposure of birds to organophosphorus insecticides. (2) The measurement of DNA damage caused by aromatic hydrocarbons. DNA adduct formation has been studied using the P-32-postlabelling technique. Several other techniques are currently under investigation. (3) The measurement of disturbances to the transthyretin-retinol binding protein complex caused by a metabolite of 3,4,3',4',tetrachlorobiphenyl. (4) The measurement of precursors of clotting proteins in blood following the inhibition of the Vitamin K cycle by anticoagulant rodenticides. Of these examples, the first is only a biomarker of exposure but the remaining three examples are, in principle, biomarkers of toxic effect since they all represent measures of molecular mechanisms which underly toxicity. Biochemical biomarkers have considerable potential for measuring effects of chemicals under field conditions - especially where carefully selected combinations of them are used.

KW  - MODELING
AB  - Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plant height is an important trait for the diverse environmental conditions found in the Great Plains. It has been related to seedling emergence, lodging, soil erosion, ease of harvest, crop residue and weed control. The hypothesis that transpiration, which integrates atmosphere, soil, and plant processes, could be used to characterize environmental effects on wheat plant height was tested in this research. Data from four commercial winter wheat cultivars (Arapahoe, TAM107, Vista, and Siouxland) and nine environments in Nebraska in 1992 and 1993 were used. The climatic regions represented in this study ranged from sub-humid to semiarid. To test our hypothesis, a spring wheat growth and yield model was modified to predict plant height development (modeled as a sigmoidal function of time) in winter wheat. Daily height increment was based on the ratio of actual to potential transpiration. The model was run for these four cultivars in eight environments. Data from the ninth environment was used to estimate maximum plant height for each cultivar; a necessary input into the model. Modeled plant height predictions were in good agreement with actual measurements for all environments (R(2) = 0.80). Based on these results, we conclude that transpiration was a good indicator of environment for plant height development in winter wheat.

AB  - Buildings exposed to water can release undesirable substances which, once transported to environmental compartments, may cause unwanted effects. These exposure pathways need to be investigated and included in risk assessments to safeguard water quality and promote the sustainability of construction materials. The applied materials, exposure conditions, distribution routes and resilience of receiving compartments vary considerably. This demonstrates the need for a consistent concept that integrates knowledge of emission sources, leaching processes, transport pathways, and effects on targets. Such a consistent concept can serve as the basis for environmental risk assessment for several scenarios using experimentally determined emissions. Typically, a source-path-target concept integrates data from standardized leaching tests and models to describe leaching processes, the distribution of substances in the environment and the occurrence of substances at different points of compliance. This article presents an integrated concept for assessing the environmental impact of construction products on aquatic systems and unravels currently existing gaps and necessary actions. This manuscript outlines a source-path-target concept applicable to a large variety of construction products. It is intended to highlight key elements of a holistic evaluation concept that could assist authorities in developing procedures for environmental risk assessments and mitigation measures and identifying knowledge gaps.

AB  - The most serious problem of intergeneric and interspecific hybridization is related to overcoming the reproductive isolation of different species. We assessed the efficiency of reproduction under in vitro conditions and the ex vitro growth capacity of interspecific hybrids of Vaccinium uliginosum x (V. corymbosum x V. angustifolium). The percentage of seed germination in in vitro culture was 88% for V. uliginosum, form No. 8 x (V. corymbosum x V. angustifolium), SC5-8, while it was 42% for V. uliginosum, form No. 8 x (V. corymbosum x V. angustifolium), 'Northcountry'. The analysis of mean value showed that the multiplication rate increased and the shoot height decreased as the 2-isopentenyl adenine (2iP) concentration was increased in the nutrient medium of the studied hybrids. The maximum rate was achieved using 15 mu M 2iP. A detailed analysis of the hybrids indicated that the hybrid variant reliably affected growth and development indicators. Inter simple sequence repeat analysis demonstrated that all analyzed hybrids inherited DNA fragments of the parent plants in various combinations, confirming their hybrid nature. Thus, the use of in vitro methods for the propagation and further selection of genotypes is demonstrated as being an effective approach for developing interspecific hybrids of V. uliginosum x (V. corymbosum x V. angustifolium).

AB  - In mobile crowd computing (MCC), smart mobile devices (SMDs) are utilized as computing resources. To achieve satisfactory performance and quality of service, selecting the most suitable resources (SMDs) is crucial. The selection is generally made based on the computing capability of an SMD, which is defined by its various fixed and variable resource parameters. As the selection is made on different criteria of varying significance, the resource selection problem can be duly represented as an MCDM problem. However, for the real-time implementation of MCC and considering its dynamicity, the resource selection algorithm should be time-efficient. In this paper, we aim to find out a suitable MCDM method for resource selection in such a dynamic and time-constraint environment. For this, we present a comparative analysis of various MCDM methods under asymmetric conditions with varying selection criteria and alternative sets. Various datasets of different sizes are used for evaluation. We execute each program on a Windows-based laptop and also on an Android-based smartphone to assess average runtimes. Besides time complexity analysis, we perform sensitivity analysis and ranking order comparison to check the correctness, stability, and reliability of the rankings generated by each method.

AB  - East African riparian corridors are biodiversity hot spots that occur in catchments degrading under deforestation and overgrazing. Quadrats and belt transects were employed to investigate plant succession along the River Gilgil, in the Kenyan Rift Valley. The study found that most species (total 365) were broadly distributed across the tropics, but Rift Valley endemics were 12.5%, and 4%-18% were exotic. Plant composition varied with altitude, lithology, soils and rainfall. Agglomerative (Jaccard) hierarchical clustering and Non-metric Dimensional Scaling identified two and three vegetation groups, for quadrats and transects, respectively, correlated with lithology and soils. Indicator species analysis highlighted that the upstream portion of the catchment was characterised by forest taxa with few exotics. The downstream included woodland species adapted to mesic/xeric conditions and to overgrazing. Longitudinal change in species composition (beta diversity) between sites was assessed by taking into consideration the contribution of 'spatial species turnover' and 'nestedness', resulting from species replacement and species loss, respectively. The beta diversity of the riparian corridor vegetation was 0.40 and spatial turnover accounted for 80%-85% of this, while the rest was attributed to the nestedness component. Riverine and native trees increased downstream but with low regeneration. Afromontane vegetation extended its distribution towards lower altitudes.

AB  - The human respiratory tract has a complex airflow pattern. If any obstruction is present in the airways, it will change the airflow pattern and deposit particles inside the airways. This is the concern of breath quality (inspired air), and it is decreasing due to the unplanned production of material goods. This is a primary cause of respiratory illness (asthma, cancer, etc.). Therefore, it is important to identify the flow characteristics in the human airways and airways with a glomus tumour with particle deposition. A numerical diagnosis is presented with an asymmetric unsteady-state light breathing condition (10 l/min). An in vitro human respiratory tract model has been reconstructed using computed tomography scan techniques and an artificial glomus tumour developed 2 cm above a carina on the posterior wall of the trachea. The transient flow characteristics are numerically simulated with a realizable (low Reynolds number) k-epsilon turbulence model. The flow disturbance is captured around the tumour, which influenced the upstream and downstream of the flow. The flow velocity pattern, wall shear stress and probable area of inflammation (hotspot) due to suspended particle deposition are determined, which may assist doctors more effectively in aerosol therapy and prosthetics of human airways illness.

AB  - Reduction of the green-house effect can be obtained by reducing the emissions of CO2. One of the technologies that contributes to this purpose is using solar cooling systems. An example of such systems is Lithium Bromide Absorption Chillers-Driven by Hot Water (LiBr/H2O absorption chillers). These chillers are normally powered by solar collectors (ordinary plate or evacuate tubular), which are widely accessible. This paper includes a review of previous experimental and theoretical studies on the effect of single cooling absorption systems. In addition, new proposals regarding the design of the solar collectors, supporting systems for energy and cooling methods will be provided. Furthermore, the present paper also summarizes the major double influence of the cooling absorption systems, add to the two-stage and half-effect absorption coolers. The influence of double cooling absorption systems using solar power could be considered for the buildings with more cooling capacity requirements, but with structure of space restrictions. However, for these cases is important to consider the direct irradiation, which needs high levels. For dry regions with water shortage, half-absorption and two-stage absorption coolers are more suitable. Solar-powered cooling systems designs should follow and incorporate standard rules based on the characteristics of various areas in order to be applicable on a large scale.

AB  - Sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis are marine copepods that are the primary parasitic threat to Atlantic salmon Salmo salar aquaculture. Prior to infecting a host, L. salmonis embryos and larvae rely entirely on maternally derived lipid reserves, offering a unique lens for investigation of energetic trade-offs and reproductive investment. In the current study, we combined histology and image processing to assess L. salmonis embryo size, number of lipid droplets per egg, and lipid area across monthly collections (2018-2019) from S. salar farms in Maine, USA. Results indicate consistent embryo areas from season to season, peak lipid metrics in May, and minima in lipid quantities from October-December. Therefore, gravid females appear to invest the highest lipid levels in their embryos under biologically favorable conditions, when future larvae may thrive in the plankton and infection typically begins to surge on farms. In contrast, maternal lice likely allocate proportionately more energy into metabolizing their own lipid stores for vertical migration and survival through the winter. A detailed understanding of seasonal lipid reserves is fundamental for the improvement of infection models. These indicators at the earliest developmental stage partially encode recruitment of subsequent planktonic larvae, enabling unique forecasting potential to inform pest management on salmon farms.

AB  - The study compares the quality of the habitats of mountain streams in sections without visible human integration and those permanently transformed by human activity between mountain areas in different climate zones. Three mountain streams with small catchments (10-20 km(2)) characterized by different natural conditions were selected for the research. The selected streams are Bystrzanka (Beskid Niski, Polish Carpathians), Peshok (Darjeeling Himalaya in India), and Fanshen (Hengduan Shan in China). Field studies were carried out using the British River Habitat Survey (RHS) method. Habitat quality was analyzed based on the following indicators: Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) and Habitat Modification Score (HMS). The obtained results indicated that sections of mountain streams located in upper catchment areas show greater habitat naturalness in relation to stream sections in lower areas. This results from the greater variety and number of natural hydromorphological elements in streams and the close vicinity of channels. In both upper and lower stream sections, regardless of the degree of naturalness and anthropopressure, the same RHS attributes have the greatest impact on the HQA and HMS values. Similar regularities in the degree of naturalness and anthropogenic modifications of the habitat between the upper and lower reaches of streams can be also expected in other mountain areas, apart from areas not affected by human activities.

AB  - Tropical countries are subjected to natural disasters which cause substantial human and economic losses. Coping with disasters in tropics requires to improve our understanding of the frequency and distribution of hydrometeorological disaster events. These assessments are scarce in many developing countries, despite rapid urban expansion and lacking efficient public policies. Costa Rica's location over the Intertropical Convergence Zone, its mountainous landscapes, and vulnerability generate risks conditions for urbans centers. Here, we analyze the Greater Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica (GAM in Spanish), a region that concentrates 65% of the national population. We analyze the hydrometeorological disasters occurrence and distribution in the GAM as well as a population and social indicators analysis to identify spatial patterns of demographic growth. Our results indicate that 5987 hydrometeorological disasters events were reported in the GAM between 1970 and 2018. From this total, 63.7% were floods, 35.3% landslides, 0.9% droughts and 0.1% storms. Coupling historical natural disasters and public policies to an urban sprawl continuous process in the GAM is a critical tool for land use planning and disaster risk reduction decision makers. Results from this study can enhance our understanding on the spatiotemporal characteristics of natural disasters in developing and/or tropical countries urban areas.

AB  - Performances of solar dryers for the drying of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP) in Africa were reviewed. Policy formulation indicators, including the economic and the environmental impact analysis that was lacking in almost all research, were presented in this study. Three countries, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria, were used as case studies. Key indicators analyzed were the amount of money saved and CO2 reduction based on 10% to 100% rate of utilization and cost of a kWh of energy in each country. Results showed that as the rate of usage increased from 10% to 100% for drying Lemongrass in Egypt, the amount of money saved increased from $102.5 - $1025/year. While, in the same country at the same drying condition and mass, it increased from $123.5 - $1235.44/year for drying Oregano. Drying of Chilli in the coastal area of Nigeria saved more money than drying of Basil in Egypt under the same rate of usage. About 40702.38-407023.8 kg of CO2 per year can be reduced in the drying of Grape in Egypt, while 2308.5-23085 kg of CO2 can be reduced for drying of Chilli in Nigeria.

AB  - Odonates are fascinating insects and important indicators of water quality and ecological health. They are key organisms of terrestrial and aquatic food webs in form of predators and preys. A study of seasonal variation and diversity of Odonates was conducted at Abheda Mahal of Kota Rajasthan, India in 2018 -2019. Abheda Mahal is a tourist spot on the outskirts of Kota city with a large pond adjacent to the palace. The site has lush gardens and vegetation. Adult specimens were collected and counted by belt transect method using aerial nets. Specimens were spread, pinned and stored in insect boxes. Identification was done by Zoological Survey of India, Jodhpur, India. The study revealed a total number of 8 species of Odonates belonging to 2 families, out of which 5 species were dragonflies of family Libellulidae and 3 species were damselflies of family Coenagrionidae. Crocothemis servilia was most abundant and Acisoma panorpoides was least abundant. Abundance of Odonates was highest in monsoon and post monsoon but declined to the least in summer season. The Higher Abundance can be attributed to high rainfall and humidity (83%-94%) with temperature range of 24.50C to 29.50C, favourable vegetation, perching sites and breeding conditions. The present study provides a baseline data of the site for further taxonomy base research and also for conservational activities. It will also increase interest in research of Odonate diversity.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the life-cycle environmental impacts associated with energy-retrofit strategies on an urban scale. A prototype campus model that includes deep retrofit clusters, moderate retrofit clusters, and baseline retrofit clusters is used as a case study. The retrofit strategies included major changes to the building envelope with additional insulation, replacement of exterior windows and doors, shading, primary mechanical system replacement, and lighting system replacement. The study aims to (1) compare the three levels of energy retrofit against the existing condition to determine potential reductions in environmental impact, (2) identify the life-cycle hotspots of the energy-retrofit strategies and possible mitigation methods, (3) calculate the payback time for each energy-retrofit level, and (4) demonstrate an example of how life-cycle assessment (LCA) could be used as a quantitative assessment method for energy retrofits done on a large scale. The life-cycle environmental impact is calculated for five categories. The results indicate that energy retrofits overall have a positive effect in terms of reducing life-cycle environmental impacts in all environmental categories except ozone-depletion potential. The deep energy retrofit has a much shorter payback time for its environmental-impact reduction than the other energy-retrofit levels.

TI  - Indicators in Estimation of Land Degradation Neutrality for Russian Boreal Forests
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the land degradation neutrality (LDN) concept of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification to the Russian boreal forests. In this regard, it is necessary to adapt three global LDN indicators (land cover, land productivity, and carbon stock) to the assessment of land degradation processes of boreal forests in Russia and around the world. According to the research results, landscapes with different types of forest restoration dynamics can be viewed as an object of forest land dynamic studies. A set of LDN indicators adapted for boreal forests conditions has also been suggested in the course of our research. In order to assess LDN proxies, we calculated the retrospective and projected net carbon balance in the middle taiga zone of the Noshulskoye forest domain (Komi Republic, Russia) using the CBM CFS model. We explored three scenarios of forest net carbon balance under three different felling regimes. The net carbon balance should not be applied as an independent LDN indicator, because it does not take into account changes in species diversity and primary productivity. It is suggested that industrial felling should imitate natural types of restoration dynamics in order to achieve LDN targets. It can be reached through minimization of forest felling at sites with fireless types of succession, which accumulate maximum stocks of dead phytomass matter and serve as forest refuges supporting biodiversity.

AB  - The wastewater sector accounts for 25% of the global energy demand in the water sector. Since this consumption is expected to increase in the forthcoming years, energy optimization strategies are needed. A truly effective planning of energy improvement measures requires a detailed knowledge of a system, which can only be achieved through energy audit and real-time monitoring. In order to improve the identification of critical issues related to the use of energy resources within a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the paper shows the results of a monitoring campaign performed on a large WWTP in southern Italy. Data obtained for the audit cover a 4-year timeframe (2014-2017). Energy-environmental performance has been evaluated through the benchmarking of: system variables, specific consumptions, and operational indicators. Moreover, by using a real-time data measurement and acquisition system it has been possible to evaluate the real performance of the most energy-intensive apparatus of the plant (a turbo-blower), over a period of 8 months. The main results indicate that (a) the plant is mainly affected by a massive capture of infiltrations, working in conditions close to the maximum hydraulic capacity, (b) real-time energy measurements are necessary to accurately characterize plant consumptions and adequately assess their critical aspects.

AB  - A standard procedure in kinematic analyses of deformed rocks is studying samples only on the foliation perpendicular/lineation parallel section based on the assumption that the rotational component of deformation is restricted to that plane. The theoretical background for this procedure is that deformation is plane strain, which is often useful but fails to account for all relevant features observed in many natural cases. More general, 3D kinematic models reproduce several of these features and help to better understand 3D deformation, likely predominant in nature, so they are a more appropriate starting point for deformation zone analysis. Theoretical and natural 3D deformation examples suggest that the section with highest degree of asymmetry (the vorticity normal section, VNS) and the corresponding vorticity vector are independent from the finite strain fabric, and thus may present varied orientations with respect to the tectonic foliation and lineation. The VNS orientation depends on the kinematics resulting from boundary conditions whereas the strain fabric orientation also depends on accumulated strain. The orientation of the VNS is itself an essential element of shear zone kinematics, hence it cannot be pre-assumed but must be determined independently.

AB  - The fate of several emerging pollutants in a Greek river system was assessed through analytical measurements and mathematical modelling. Target compounds selected in this study consist of five endocrine disrupting chemicals and four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Two sampling campaigns were implemented to assess target compounds concentrations along the river system during dry period. Furthermore a mathematical model was developed in order to simulate the spatial distribution of target compounds concentration. The mathematical model describes several abiotic and biotic processes (sorption, photodegradation, biodegradation, biotransformation) in order to account for the removal of target compounds. Following sensitivity analysis, the model was calibrated and validated against measured values. Environmental risk assessment was performed based on both analytical measurements and simulation results. Uncertainty analysis was also conducted by applying Monte Carlo technique. According to the results the simulation data matched very satisfactorily with the analytical measurements, thus confirming the main experimental observations showing that the primary removal mechanism for the photo-sensitive chemicals is photodegradation, the latter being mostly influenced by weather conditions and river general quality characteristics (e.g. chlorophyll, turbidity). Model results demonstrate a gradual increase of uncertainty from the upstream to the downstream of the river system for all target compounds.

AB  - Building refurbishment is a key in promoting environmentally sustainable development due to its potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption associated with existing buildings. The general metrics for assessing the impacts of refurbishment have not been established for existing buildings in most of the countries. In Malaysia, there is currently no single environmental assessment scheme for building refurbishment. The existing environmental assessment schemes are not sufficiently robust, as they do not include factors such as quality of services and economics. It is essential to have a customised suite of sustainability schemes specifically designed for the Malaysian context to facilitate best practice for non-domestic refurbishment assessment. A comprehensive Delphi process was developed to assist in the identification of suitable assessment schemes for use in non-domestic buildings. Three successive rounds of surveys were conducted with ten Delphi experts with expertise in sustainability and green assessment. The study revealed that energy related factors such as air-conditioning were ranked as the most important assessment theme for refurbishment, followed by indoor environmental quality and water assessment. The findings of this research will be used to develop a weighting system by using the analytic hierarchy process in the next research stage, leading to a complete refurbishment environmental assessment scheme.

AB  - Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has become an increasingly important world energy resource and is a part of the European Union clean fuel strategy launched in 2013. Therefore, there are currently several ongoing measurement strategies considering quality specification of LNG. In this context, for application in gas engines, it is essential to understand the combustion behavior of these natural gas mixtures. The methane number (MN) which represents a scale for the knocking propensity, is one of the main indicators for this combustion behavior. In this study, we investigated the influence of the LNG composition on the ignition delay time and thus the knocking behavior of prototypical LNG Mixtures. Several LNG typical mixtures containing CH4/C2H6/C3H8/n-C4H10/i-C4H10/n-C5H12/i-C5H12/N-2 were studied in the temperature range 850-1450 K, with pressures of 20 and 40 bar and at equivalence ratios of 0.4 and 1.2. The use of a shock tube and a rapid compression machine facility allowed us to study the ignition behavior over a wide range of operating conditions relevant to gas engines. We report a detailed investigation of LNG autoignition with respect to temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio thereby providing crucial validation data for chemical kinetic models for real applications.

AB  - Metabolic composition is known to exert influence on several important agronomic traits, and metabolomics, which represents the chemical composition in a cell, has long been recognized as a powerful tool for bridging phenotype-genotype interactions. In this work, sixteen truly representative sugarcane Brazilian varieties were selected to explore the metabolic networks in buds and culms, the tissues involved in the vegetative propagation of this species. Due to the fact that bud sprouting is a key trait determining crop establishment in the field, the sprouting potential among the genotypes was evaluated. The use of partial least square discriminant analysis indicated only mild differences on bud outgrowth potential under controlled environmental conditions. However, primary metabolite profiling provided information on the variability of metabolic features even under a narrow genetic background, typical for modern sugarcane cultivars. Metabolite-metabolite correlations within and between tissues revealed more complex patterns for culms in relation to buds, and enabled the recognition of key metabolites (e.g., sucrose, putrescine, glutamate, serine, and myo-inositol) affecting sprouting ability. Finally, those results were associated with the genetic background of each cultivar, showing that metabolites can be potentially used as indicators for the genetic background.

AB  - Wastewater treatment is a high energy consuming process, and its energy demand is considerably increasing due to the introduction of more restrictive standards on the quality of water effluents, that require advanced technologies for pollutant removal. Energy audits are carried out in order to improve energy efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, by introducing some measures, such as adjustments of the treatment scheme, or optimization of existing operational units. At the same time, energy recovery from wastewater treatment and its by-products is being implemented in order to reduce economic costs and environmental impact of the process. In order to assess the benefits resulting from implementation of these interventions, procedures for evaluation of energy performance of wastewater treatment plants are being developed.
   In this work, a novel method is proposed for assessing energy performance of wastewater treatment plants by coupling simple energy performance indicators with specific pollution removal efficiencies. This procedure is applied to a large database of wastewater treatment plants, in order to define some classes of energy performance depending on removal efficiency. The method is also used to analyse some Italian plants, representative of different design and management conditions. As a result, only 8.2% of around 300 plants presents the highest class of performance, considering the energy consumption related to the organic matter removal.

AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions lead to negative environmental impacts and it is considered as an indicator for the larger group of gaseous sulfur oxides (SOx) in the air. In this paper, the dimethylamine (DMA) solution was used as the absorbent in a alpha-Al2O3 hollow fiber membrane contactor that is operated under several conditions of gas velocity, liquid velocity, and 290 K operating temperature. The effects of gas and liquid phase properties and module configuration on SO2 absorption efficiency in the hollow fiber membrane contactor were investigated. Simulation results showed that the changes of gas phase velocity, liquid phase velocity, and concentration have great influences on the absorption efficiency of SO2. An increase of the gas flow rate decreases the SO2 absorption efficiency, while an increase of the liquid flow rate has the opposite effect, increasing the efficiency. Because gas in the membrane module stays for a longer time, more absorption time promotes the gas and liquid reaction. However, the changes of the volume fraction of SO2 in the mixed gas are not significant to SO2 absorption. The simulation model could provide guidelines for selecting suitable fluid properties during the SO2 absorption process in a hollow fiber membrane contactor.

AB  - Due to the increasing environmental impact of food production, carbon footprint as an indicator can guide farmland management. This study established a method and estimated the carbon footprint of grain production in China based on life cycle analysis (LCA). The results showed that grain production has a high carbon footprint in 2013, i.e., 4052 kg ce/ha or 0.48 kg ce/kg for maize, 5455 kg ce/ha or 0.75 kg ce/kg for wheat and 11881 kg ce/ha or 1.60 kg ce/kg for rice. These footprints are higher than that of other countries, such as the United States, Canada and India. The most important factors governing carbon emissions were the application of nitrogen fertiliser (8-49%), straw burning (0-70%), energy consumption by machinery (6-40%), energy consumption for irrigation (0-44%) and CH4 emissions from rice paddies (15-73%). The most important carbon sequestration factors included returning of crop straw (41-90%), chemical nitrogen fertiliser application (10-59%) and no-till farming practices (0-10%). Different factors dominated in different crop systems in different regions. To identity site-specific key factors and take countermeasures could significantly lower carbon footprint, e.g., ban straw burning in northeast and south China, stopping continuous flooding irrigation in wheat and rice production system.

AB  - Labile organic carbon (LOC) is the most active fraction of soil organic carbon (SOC) with rapid turnover rates, and has been suggested as sensitive indicator of SOC pool under global change. However, the knowledge of LOC pools in coastal wetland soils and their implication for soil carbon reservoir are still scarce. We characterized LOC in soils from two coastal wetlands using cold water extractable carbon (CWC), hot water extractable carbon (HWC), and acid hydrolysable carbon (AHC). Our results indicated that SOC and its labile fractions are higher in Guangrao than that in Changyi. CWC comprised about 24.09-34.86% of SOC for Guangrao and 1.54-2.43% for Changyi. The HWC content was generally higher than CWC, and HWC in Changyi contributed higher proportion to SOC compared with Guangrao wetland. The AHC represented much higher proportion of SOC about 45.94-50.11% in Guangrao and 60.38-65.08% in Changyi, respectively. CWC, HWC and AHC were significantly correlated with each other in profile CB1. Poor correlation among LOC and SOC was observed in GA1, GA2 and CB2. Differences in vegetation and hydrological condition should be considered for obtaining accurate carbon calculation. Relative high proportion of LOC suggests these wetlands might be particularly vulnerable to a warming environment.

AB  - The colours from natural waters differ markedly over the globe, depending on the water composition and illumination conditions. The space-borne ocean colour instruments are operational instruments designed to retrieve important water-quality indicators, based on the measurement of water leaving radiance in a limited number (5 to 10) of narrow (approximate to 10 nm) bands. Surprisingly, the analysis of the satellite data has not yet paid attention to colour as an integral optical property that can also be retrieved from multispectral satellite data. In this paper we re-introduce colour as a valuable parameter that can be expressed mainly by the hue angle (). Based on a set of 500 synthetic spectra covering a broad range of natural waters a simple algorithm is developed to derive the hue angle from SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS and OLCI data. The algorithm consists of a weighted linear sum of the remote sensing reflectance in all visual bands plus a correction term for the specific band-setting of each instrument. The algorithm is validated by a set of 603 hyperspectral measurements from inland-, coastal- and near-ocean waters. We conclude that the hue angle is a simple objective parameter of natural waters that can be retrieved uniformly for all space-borne ocean colour instruments.

AB  - Assessing the impacts of avian collisions with wind turbines requires reliable estimates of avian flight intensities and altitudes, to enable accurate estimation of collision rates, avoidance rates and related effects on populations. At sea, obtaining such estimates visually is limited not only by weather conditions but, more importantly, because a high proportion of birds fly at night and at heights above the range of visual observation. We used vertical radar with automated bird-tracking software to overcome these limitations and obtain data on the magnitude, timing and altitude of local bird movements and seasonal migration measured continuously at a Dutch offshore wind farm. An estimated 1.6 million radar echoes representing individual birds or flocks were recorded crossing the wind farm annually at altitudes between 25 and 115m (the rotor-swept zone). The majority of these fluxes consisted of gull species during the day and migrating passerines at night. We demonstrate daily, monthly and seasonal patterns in fluxes at rotor heights and the influence of wind direction on flight intensity. These data are among the first to show the magnitude and variation of low-altitude flight activity across the North Sea, and are valuable for assessing the consequences of developments such as offshore wind farms for birds.

AB  - Along Mediterranean coastlines, beach tourism represents one of the main economic resources of coastal regions. In the context of increase of coastal hazards, large management projects are currently undertaken and the evaluation of beach use is an important parameter coastal managers have to take into account in their strategies to reduce risk and maintain the recreational capacity of the beach. This contribution proposes an automatic tool to evaluate beach attendance and beach users behavior. After validating the results, an analysis of the beach attendance at the Lido of Sete Beach, on the French Mediterranean coast, is performed. Both temporal and spatial patterns are obtained and analyzed together with environmental, meteorological, social parameters of the site. Results indicate that beach attendance and beach user locations are mostly driven by meteorological conditions, while the density indicates that most of the beach users are locals or excursionists, rather than tourists. The results of the total beach attendance during the year 2012 clearly evidence an important increase of the frequentation since the large costal management project that was implemented during the last years. Given the large number of images and video available at many coastlines, the developed methodology and tool would be useful in many coastal management applications around the world.

AB  - Snow avalanches are a threat to many kinds of elements (human beings, communication axes, structures, etc.) in mountain regions. For risk evaluation, the vulnerability assessment of civil engineering structures such as buildings and dwellings exposed to avalanches still needs to be improved. This paper presents an approach to determine the fragility curves associated with reinforced concrete (RC) structures loaded by typical avalanche pressures and provides quantitative results for different geometrical configurations. First, several mechanical limit states of the RC wall are defined using classical engineering approaches (Eurocode 2), and the pressure of structure collapse is calculated from the usual yield line theory. Next, the fragility curve is evaluated as a function of avalanche loading using a Monte Carlo approach, and sensitivity studies (Sobol indices) are conducted to estimate the respective weight of the RC wall model inputs. Finally, fragility curves and relevant indicators such a their mean and fragility range are proposed for the different structure boundary conditions analyzed. The influence of the input distributions on the fragility curves is investigated. This shows the wider fragility range and/or the slight shift in the median that has to be considered when a possible slight change in mean/standard deviation/inter-variable correlation and/or the non-Gaussian nature of the input distributions is accounted for.

AB  - Producing good-quality eggplant seedlings is essential for a uniform system of cultivation and yield. The seedlings can be grown in organic or mineral substrates, or a mixture of these. This study evaluated the effect of vermiculite and crushed cassava stems, both pure and as a mixture, on eggplant-seedling growth in two types of environment and in two different types of container. A nursery greenhouse and poly-tunnel greenhouses, both with monofilament screening and 50% shading, were used. In each environment polystyrene trays of 72 and 128 cells were tested. These were filled with: 0% vermiculite and 100% cassava stems; 20% vermiculite and 80% cassava stems; 40% vermiculite and 60% cassava stems; 60% vermiculite and 40% cassava stems; 80% vermiculite and 20% cassava stems, and 100% vermiculite and 0% cassava stems. The experimental design was completely randomized into a scheme of subdivided sub-plots (2 environments x 2 containers x 6 substrates) totaling 24 treatments. The monofilament screen is the best environment when using a tray of 72 cells. For trays of 128 cells, the greenhouse provides the best conditions. The best container for eggplant seedlings is the tray of 72 cells. The median mixtures of vermiculite and cassava stems, between 40 and 60%, are the best substrate for the eggplant seedling. The Dickson quality index is a good indicator of the standard of quality of the eggplant seedlings.

AB  - To evaluate water resources sustainability at the watershed scale within a river basin's context, the Water Resources Sustainability Evaluation Model is developed. The model employs 4 criteria (economic efficiency, social equity, environmental conservation, and maintenance capacity) and has 16 indicators, integrating them using their relative weights. The model is applied to evaluate the water resources sustainability of watersheds in the Geum River basin, South Korea. A geographic information system is employed to efficiently build a database for the indicators, and the values of the indicators are normalized using the probability distribution functions fitted to the datasets of the indicators. The evaluation results show that, overall, the water resources sustainability of the watersheds in the upper basin is better than other areas due to the good environmental conditions and the dam management policies of South Korea. The analysis of the correlations among the model's components and the comparison between the results of the model and the Water Poverty Index show that the model can provide reasonable evaluation results for the water resources sustainability of watersheds. Consequently, it is concluded that the model can be an effective tool for evaluating the states of water resource management from the perspective of sustainable development and provide a basis on which to create policies for improving any inadequacies in watersheds.

AB  - A check-list of the macroalgae which colonize the artificial structures "dykes" formed by limestone blocks, placed between the northern Adriatic Sea and the Venice Lagoon to protect the wide sea inlets of Lido and Malamocco, the stone breakwaters and the submerged reefs parallel and perpendicular to the sea coastline of the Lido island "Murazzi" is presented. Macroalgae have been sampled monthly during one-year period (February 2007-January 2008) both in the lagoon inlets and along the marine coast. Flora was represented by 213 taxa: 61 Chlorophyta, 114 Rhodophyta, 38 Ochrophyta (37 Phaeophyceae, 1 Xanthophyceae), with the richest and luxuriant vegetation in the lagoon inlet areas. The application of the Rhodophyta/Chlorophyta (R/C) index and the Expert-Macrophyte Quality Index (E-MaQI) highlighted the "High" ecological status (EQR > 0.9) of the lagoon inlet areas.
   As E-MaQI is not applicable in marine areas, an adaptation of CARLIT to the anthropic structures of the north-western coasts of the northern Adriatic Sea and its integration with the dominant taxa is proposed.
   The application of the revised index to the Lido dykes and breakwaters placed along the marine littorals shows "Moderate" conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A waste stabilisation pond (WSP) system formed by two anaerobic ponds, a facultative pond and a maturation pond was studied from December 2003 to September 2004 in north-western Spain in order to evaluate its efficiency in the removal of faecal indicator bacteria (total coliforms, Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci), coliphages, helminth eggs and protozoan (oo)cysts (Cryptosporidium and Giardia). Furthermore, sediment samples were collected from the bottom of the ponds to assess the settling rates and thus determine the main pathogen removal mechanisms in the WSPs system. The overall removal ranged from 1.4 log units for coliphages in the cold period to 5.0 log units for E. coli in the hot period. Cryptosporidium oocysts were reduced by an average of 96%, Giardia cysts by 98% and helminth eggs by 100%. The anaerobic ponds showed significantly higher surface removal rates (4.6, 5.2 and 3.7 log (oo)cysts/eggs removed m(-2) day(-1), respectively) than facultative and maturation ponds. Sunlight and water physicochemical conditions were the main factors influencing C. parvum oocysts removal both in the anaerobic and maturation ponds, whereas other factors like predation or natural mortality were more important in the facultative pond. Sedimentation, the most commonly proposed mechanism for cyst removal had, therefore, a negligible influence in the studied ponds.

AB  - Identification of trait syndromes that make species vulnerable to habitat fragmentation is essential in predicting biodiversity change. Plants are considered particularly vulnerable if their capacities for persistence in and for dispersal among local habitats are low. Here we investigated the influence of easily measured functional traits on the presence of 45 plant species in an urban landscape in north-west Germany where patches were separated by distances consistent with regular plant dispersal range. To describe the spatial configuration of patches we calculated species-specific patch connectivities. Then we assessed plant connectivity responses in distribution models calculated from connectivities and environmental predictors. Twenty (45%) of the analysed species showed a positive connectivity response after accounting for species-specific habitat requirements. These species differed from non-responsive species by functional traits associated with dispersal, including reduced seed numbers and higher terminal velocities relative to non-responsive species. Persistence traits played however no role which we attribute to the environmental conditions of urban habitats and their spatiotemporal characteristics. Our study underlines that even ruderal plants experience dispersal limitation and demonstrates that easily measured functional traits may be used as indicators of fragmentation vulnerability in urban systems allowing generalizations to larger species sets.

AB  - One of the surest signatures of recent positive selection is a local elevation of advantageous allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium (LD). We proposed to detect such hitchhiking effects by using extended stretches of homozygosity as a surrogate indicator of recent positive selection. An extended haplotype-based homozygosity score test (EHHST) was developed to detect excess homozygosity. The EHHST conditioned on existing LD and it tested the haplotype version of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compared with existing popular tests, which usually lack clear distribution, the EHHST is asymptotically normal, which makes analysis and applications easier. In particular, the EHHST facilitates the computation of an asymptotic P-value instead of an empirical P-value, using simulations. We evaluated by simulation that the EHHST led to appropriate false-positive rates, and it had higher or similar power as the existing popular methods. The method was applied to HapMap Phase II data. We were able to replicate previous findings of strong positive selection in 17 autosome genomic regions out of 20 reported candidates. On the basis of high EHHST values and population differentiations, we identified 15 new candidate regions that could undergo recent selection.

AB  - Due to the wide application of composite insulators in the power industry, the insulator performance is challenged by various environments. To determine the flashover performance of rime-iced composite insulator, laboratory investigation was carried out in an artificial climate chamber to simulate different rime-ice morphology on the insulator surface. The configuration and characteristics of the rime-ice were demonstrated to establish the relationship between the rime-ice parameters and the flashover performance. In accordance with the discharge phenomena, the transition of leakage current (LC) until the flashover was analyzed by using a recurrent plot approach. After extracting the high frequency components by using a wavelet transform technique, the LC just before the flashover was extended to m dimensional phase space based on a phase space reconstructed method. The recurrent plot was obtained to reveal the non-linear characteristics of LC for identifying the dynamic behaviors on the insulator surface. It is shown that the propagation and properties of the discharges can be graphically projected on the topological structure of recurrent plot as a function of the rime-ice parameters. The process and underlying mechanism of flashover performance of rime-iced composite insulator can be visually reflected by the recurrent plot and the quantitative indicators of LC.

AB  - By taking silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) as plasmon resonance scattering (PRS) indicator considering that Ag-NPs have strong plasmon resonance light scattering signals corresponding to their plasmon resonance absorption (PRA), we propose a label-free visual immunoassay on the solid support of glass slides. Our investigations showed that Ag-NPs could be adsorbed on the surface of glass slides where immunoreactions between a previously immobilized antigen and its antibody have occurred if the glass slides were immersed in an Ag-NP suspension whose pH value has been carefully adjusted. The optimal pH of the Ag-NP suspension depends on the nature of previously immobilized antigen and its antibody. it was found that the adsorption of negative-charged Ag-NPs on the surface of glass slides depends only on the content of antibody under optimal conditions. With a common spectrofluorometer to measure the PRS signals of the Ag-NPs adsorbed on the surface, we could detect antibody in the range of 10 to 160 ng ml(-1). If a white light-emitting diode (LED) torch is employed to illuminate the glass slides, we can make visual detection of the antibody by the naked eye. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ratiometric imaging is a technique to reduce artifacts by minimizing the influence of extraneous factors on the fluorescence of a sensor and is particularly useful for cellular imaging studies. Here we characterized the iminocoumarin fluorophore as a new scaffold for sensors for ratiometric imaging. The iminocoumarin 4 showed a high quantum yield in aqueous media on excitation in the visible wavelength region, while its coumarin analogue showed little fluorescence. We therefore developed a novel fluorescence probe, ZnIC, for ratiometric imaging of Zn2+, using iminocoumarin as a fluorophore and (ethylamino)dipicolylamine as a Zn2+ chelator. ZnIC exhibited almost the same fluorescence properties as 4, and the emission spectrum of this probe was red-shifted on addition of Zn2+ under physiological conditions. ZnIC is selective for Zn2+ over other biologically important metal ions, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and has high affinity for Zn2+. To confirm the suitability of ZnIC for biological applications, we employed it for the ratiometric detection of changes in intracellular Zn2+ in cultured cells and in rat hippocampal slices. The results indicate that iminocoumarin is a useful fluorophore for fluorescence microscopic imaging and that ZnIC should be useful for studies on the biological functions of Zn2+.

AB  - The reliability of ants as bioindicators of ecosystem condition is dependent on the consistency of their response to localised habitat characteristics, which may be modified by larger-scale effects of habitat fragmentation and loss. We assessed the relative contribution of habitat fragmentation, habitat loss and within-patch habitat characteristics in determining ant assemblages in semi-arid woodland in Queensland, Australia. Species and functional group abundance were recorded using pitfall traps across 20 woodland patches in landscapes that exhibited a range of fragmentation states. Of fragmentation measures, changes in patch area and patch edge contrast exerted the greatest influence on species assemblages, after accounting for differences in habitat loss. However, 35% of fragmentation effects on species were confounded by the effects of habitat characteristics and habitat loss. Within-patch habitat characteristics explained more than twice the amount of species variation attributable to fragmentation and four times the variation explained by habitat loss. The study indicates that within-patch habitat characteristics are the predominant drivers of ant composition. We suggest that caution should be exercised in interpreting the independent effects of habitat fragmentation and loss on ant assemblages without jointly considering localised habitat attributes and associated joint effects.

AB  - The sorption of Cu(II) on olive cake, a biomass by-product of olive oil production, has been investigated by potentiometry at pH 6, I=0.1 M NaClO4, 25 degrees C and under atmospheric conditions. Numerical analysis of the experimental data supports the formation of surface complexes and allows the evaluation of the corresponding formation constant, which is found to amount log beta=5.1 +/- 0.4. This value is close to corresponding values given in literature for Cu(II)-humate complexes, indicating that the same type of active sites (e.g. carboxylic and phenolic groups) is responsible for the Cu(II) binding by olive cake. Addition of a competing metal ion (e.g. Eu(III) ion) in the system leads to replacement of the Cu(II) by Eu(III). Evaluation of the potentiometric data obtained from competition experiments indicates on a ionexchange mechanism. The formation constant of the Eu(III) species sorbed on olive cake is found to be log beta=5.4 +/- 0.9. The results of this study are of particular interest with respect to waste water treatment technologies using biomass products as adsorbent material and environmental impact assessments regarding disposal of biomass by products in the geosphere.

AB  - Thirty six element signatures were compared in historical Parmelia sulcata samples from the Natural History Museum herbarium collected over the period 1797-1967 with those recorded in the same species and tree bark sampled in 2000 from Burnham Beeches, lying 40 kin west of London. Nineteen elements reached highest concentrations in herbarium samples, consistent with a pollution legacy and dust contamination in the herbarium. Healthy Parmelia sampled east and downwind of London at a farm during peak SO2 emissions in 1967 contained highest V, Ni, Zn, Cd, Se, Ge contents, supporting derivation from fuel combustion; the same sample was previously determined as having a low delta 34S and high S and N contents. Lowest V, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sn, Ba, Pb, Mo, Sb, Li, B, Cs, U, Th, Ga contents were recorded in a sample with a high delta 34S and low S content collected in 1887 from a remote region from Ross-shire, Scotland. Se and Cd enrichment, never-the-less suggest a transboundary pollution influence. Lichen Pb concentrations from Burnham Beeches were amongst the lowest recorded in spite of lichens being collected close to roads. Herbarium samples help interpret changes in element deposition where few data exist, in spite of dust contamination. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We used X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Al K-edge to investigate the atomic structure of biogenic silica and to assess the effect of Al on its crystal chemistry, Our study provides the first direct evidence for a structural association of Al and Si in biogenic silica. In samples of cultured diatoms, Al is present exclusively in fourfold coordination. The location and relative intensity of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) features suggests the structural insertion of tetrahedral Al inside the silica framework synthesized by the organism. In diatom samples collected in the marine environment, Al is present in mixed six- and fourfold coordination. The relative intensity of XANES structures indicates the coexistence of structural Al with a clay component, which most likely reflects sample contamination by adhering mineral particles. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy has been used to get Al-O distances in biogenic silica of cultured diatoms, confirming a tetrahedral coordination. Because of its effect on solubility and reaction kinetics of biogenic silica, the structural association between Al and biogenic silica at the stage of biosynthesis has consequences for the use of sedimentary biogenic silica as an indicator of past environmental conditions.

AB  - Temperature during rearing is a major factor in production efficiency for broilers. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of five temperature regimens on the growth, feed conversion, and mortality of broilers to 21 d of age; This information is needed to select the most profitable conditions for broiler production. Three trials were conducted in 10 environmental chambers; five chambers were stocked with males, and five were stocked with females. The chambers were initially set at 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 C followed by daily reductions of 0.3 C for each beginning temperature. The dewpoint was set at 15.7 C throughout the experiments. Lighting was continuous, and feed and water were provided ad libitum. Weight gain and feed conversion were determined at 7, 14, and 21 d, and mortality was recorded as it occurred. Temperature did not affect weight gain or feed conversion for any period, but males were superior to females for these parameters for the 7- to 14-d and 14- to 21-d periods. Temperature affected mortality; most of the deaths occurred during the 0- to 7-d period and at the lowest temperature treatment. These results suggest that mortality is the best indicator of the effect of rearing temperature on performance.

AB  - Calibrated predictive relationships obtained from simple and multiple regression of thematic mapper or broad-band (BB) and 1.4 nm interval or narrow-band (NB) spectral data were evaluated for quantifying II rangeland components (including total vegetation, forb, grass, shrub, litter, and bare soil) and distinguishing among 6 long-term grazing treatments of sagebrush steppe, In general, all 4 data types predicted similar values for each rangeland cover component. Multiple regression models usually had little advantage over simple regression models for predicting cover, particularly for abundant cover components, although this trend was inconsistent among components, Consequently, simple predictive models are recommended for quantifying rangeland indicator components using remotely-sensed data. The use of NE spectral data resulted in lower standard errors of prediction (SEP), although these reductions were inconsistent among rangeland components, Although both data types distinguished among grazing treatments with major plant compositional differences (P < 0.00) using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), only the NE data distinguished between grazing treatments with minor ecological differences (P < 0.01). These results suggest that in a practical context, NE data are advantageous for quantifying rangeland cover components and distinguishing among grazing treatments under the condition of our study.

AB  - As a test of the sensitivity of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to evaluate small-scale environmental change and post-drought recovery, a time series of TM images of the small, well-mapped region around Tombouctou, Mali was analysed for change for the interval 1986-1988. Actual increases in vegetation measured during field work differed for specific landforms, ranging from 5 per cent on floodplain silts to a 40 per cent increase in ephemeral grass cover on stable dunes. This region is part of the Saharan-Sahelian fringe, where severe drought and environmental degradation occurred between 1976 and 1985. Reflectance curves derived from the TM images for six specific landform units between March 1986 and March 1988 show that seasonal reflectance changes are statistically significant, and that overall reflectance decreased over the study interval. Dunes, abandoned wadis and inactive floodplain areas near the Niger river show vegetation regrowth, while active floodplain and densely-vegetated distributary channels showed little change. Albedo proved to be a reasonable simple indicator of both seasonal change and change over the term of study. Neither the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) nor the Leaf Vegetation Index (V(L)) produced results consistent with field observation. Normalized reflectances and albedo both show appropriate seasonal trends and an overall trend towards increased vegetation that is consistent with field observations over the study interval.

AB  - Adult female specimens of Xenopus laevis were exposed to diluted artificial seawater for up to 1 week. Statistically significant increases were observed in serum levels of aldosterone and corticosterone, concomitant with a drop in levels of prolactin (PRL) receptors in the cell membranes of the epidermis and kidney, which can be taken as an indicator of the levels of circulating PRL. The changes in hormone levels were detected after 1 day, being followed by a gradual restoration of the initial mean levels of these hormones when the exposure to hyperosmotic stress was extended for up to 2 or 7 days. Comparison of the above results with those previously obtained in Xenopus after longer exposure (15 days) to brackish water substantiates the necessity of recording possible initial fluctuations, as well as any changes that occur over the course of longer exposure during which time adaptation to environmental changes are likely to take place. The reverse responses, which may be not independent of one another, in terms of levels of corticoids and PRL in the animals exposed to hyperosmotic stress, are discussed.
   A survey of the literature suggests that, in Xenopus, as in the case of other less strictly water-dwelling amphibians, PRL is one of the hormones required for life in fresh water.

AB  - Surficial (oxic) sediments, overlying water, and specimens of the freshwater bivalve Anodonta grandis were collected by divers at 11 littoral lacustrine sites located along a geochemical gradient of pH, [Cd], [Cu], and [Zn] in an area influenced by mining and smelting activities. The molluscs were dissected (gills; hepatopancreas; remaining tissues) and analyzed for Cd, Cu, Zn, and metallothioneins (MT). Tissue concentrations of MT in A. grandis varied between 100 and 440 nmol metal binding sites (g dry wt)-1. Metallothionein levels in the gills. the remaining tissues, and the whole organism were significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with tissue Cd concentrations. In contrast, correlations between [MT] and tissue levels of Cu or Zn were weak or nonexistent. The intersite variations in MT concentrations were best related, not to total dissolved metal concentrations at the time of sampling, nor to extractable metal concentrations in the sediments, but to the free Cd2+ concentration at the sediment-water interface, as estimated from sediment-water sorptive equilibria. These observations suggest that Cd2+ activity is the key environmental factor to which metallothionein levels in A. grandis are responding in the studied lakes. The mollusc condition indices (C.I. = 1,000 x total dry wt of flesh of the animals/total intervalval volume) deteriorated as Cd concentrations in the tissues increased.

AB  - It is know that pathogenic bacteria are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions.
   This applies to Enterobacteriaceae, as well, where optimum temperature is 37-degrees-C.  Wastewater of various qualities are also hostile environments to these bacteria.  The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of temperature on the die-off of enteric bacteria in waste stabilization ponds at the temperature range 40-60-degrees-C.  Survival of indicator microorganisms at the control pond effluent was higher than at increased temperature pond effluent (40-degrees-C, 50-degrees-C, 60-degrees-C).  Survival percentages of the indicators at the elevated temperature pond compared to the control pond were 0.12% to 73.33%.  The pathogenic bacteria Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella sonnie were introduced in dialysis bags placed in the ponds.  The number of the pathogenic bacteria decreased by a few orders of magnitude within days, depending on the temperature and the strain.  Following certain periods of time, the bacteria held in the heated pond and in some instances in the control pond, lost their ability to agglutinate with specific antibody.  The phenomenon of bacteria showing negative specific agglutination requires further research.  It is thought that this phenomenon might indicate an unknown heat survival mechanism of the pathogenic bacteria in adverse environment.

AB  - Agriculture is among the main causes of water pollution. Currently, 75% of global anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loads come from leaching/runoff from cropland. The grey water footprint (GWF) is an indicator of water resource pollution, which allows for the evaluation and monitoring of pollutant loads (L) that can affect water. However, in the literature, there are different approaches to estimating L and thus contrasting GWF estimates: (A1) leaching/runoff fraction approach, (A2) surplus approach and (A3) soil nitrogen balance approach. This study compares these approaches for the first time to assess which one is best adapted to real crop production conditions and optimises GWF calculation. The three approaches are applied to assess N-related GWF in barley and soybean. For barley in 2019, A3 estimated a GWF value 285 to 196% higher than A1, while in 2020, the A3 estimate was 135 to 81% higher. Soybean did not produce a GWF due to the crop characteristics. A3 incorporated N partitioning within the agroecosystem and considered different N inputs beyond fertilization, improving the accuracy of L and GWF estimation. Providing robust GWF results to decision-makers may help to prevent or reduce the impacts of activities that threaten the world's water ecosystems and supply.

AB  - An important strategy for meeting global landscape restoration goals is nursery production of high-quality seedlings. Growing seedlings with attributes that promote post-planting survival and growth can be dramatically influenced by the nursery container system. In many countries, nurseries produce seedlings in polybags filled with excavated soil. These seedlings often develop deformed roots with limited fibrosity which can lead to poor survival and growth after outplanting. Polybags are initially inexpensive but using these single-use plastic containers accrues expenses that are often untracked. Comparisons among nursery production systems must account for factors such as container longevity, labor efficiency, and seedling field performance. A more holistic approach to account for environmental, economic, social, logistic, and cultural elements in the cost-benefit equation that influences nursery production systems is needed. Converting to a modern container system requires concomitant adjustments in nursery scheduling and culturing matched to the new stock type. Doing so provides an opportunity to align nursery production techniques and resulting seedling attributes with anticipated field conditions. This article describes and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of nursery production systems and provides recommendations and case studies to aid nurseries in improving seedling quality toward meeting restoration goals in a cost-effective and timely manner.

AB  - Natural products have always enjoyed great popularity among consumers. Wild tea is an interesting alternative to tea from intensive plantations. The term "wild tea" is applied to many different varieties of tea, the most desirable and valued of which are native or indigenous tea plants. Special pro-health properties of wild tea are attributed to the natural conditions in which it grows. However, there are no complex studies that describe quality and health indicators of wild tea. The aim of this research was to evaluate the quality of wild and cultivated green tea from different regions of China: Wuzhishan, Baisha, Kunlushan, and Pu'Er. The assessment was carried out by verifying the concentration of selected chemical components in tea and relating it to the health risks they may pose, as well as to the nutritional requirements of adults. Wild tea was characterized by higher micronutrient concentration. The analyzed teas can constitute a valuable source of Mn in the diet. A higher concentration of nitrates and oxalates in cultivated tea can be associated with fertilizer use. The analyzed cultivated tea was a better source of antioxidants with a higher concentration of caffeine. There were no indications of health risks for wild or cultivated teas.

AB  - Natural terrain landslides are mainly triggered by rainstorms in Hong Kong, which pose great threats to life and property. To mitigate landslide risk, building a prediction model which could provide information on both spatial and temporal probabilities of landslide occurrence is essential but challenging. In this paper, real-time rainfall conditions are incorporated into landslide prediction through a unique rainstorm-based database of reported landslides. Other landslide controlling factors related to topography, geology, and land cover are also considered. Five machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest, adaboost tree, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron, are utilized and compared. Validated against historical rainstorms, the machine learning powered landslide prediction model could reasonably forecast the occurrence of landslides in a spatiotemporal context. Moreover, the effects of different rainstorm characteristics in terms of distinct rainfall spatial distribution and intensity on landslide susceptibility could also be captured by this model. For the landslide controlling factors investigated, rolling rainfall factors are proven to play a more important role than antecedent rainfall factors for landslide prediction. Among the five machine learning methods, the random forest model yields the most promising results in terms of all performance indicators (i.e., classification accuracy, recall, precision, area under curve, and overall accuracy).

AB  - The total contents and chemical speciation analysis of Zn, Cu, Pb, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cd, and As in pig manure (PM), liquefaction residues (LRs), and bio-oils (BOs) derived from PM by liquefaction with ethanol as a solvent at 180-300 degrees C were thoroughly investigated in this study. The environment risk assessment, leachability, and bioavailability of heavy metals in PM and LRs were studied. The results showed that more than 75% of heavy metals remained in LRs. The total contents of heavy metals in LRs were markedly elevated, but those in BOs gradually decreased with the increase in liquefaction temperature. Moreover, the acid soluble/exchangeable fraction and reducible fraction (F1 + F2) of heavy metals in LRs and BOs was significantly reduced, while oxidizable fraction and stable fraction (F3 + F4) desirably increased after liquefaction. Furthermore, the potential risk of heavy metals in LRs was decreased in comparison to that in PM, but the risk of Pb, Mn, and As had not been obviously reduced; therefore, the LRs from the liquefaction of PM should be pretreated before recycling. Temperatures from 220 to 260 degrees C were the optimum conditions for disposing of PM by liquefaction with ethanol.

AB  - A comparison of acute toxicity (LC50 values) among nine toxicants: a) six metals: Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ti, and b) three organics: benzene, ethyl acetate, and toluene, between the exotic cladoceran species Daphnia magna Straus 1820 and two native strains of freshwater cladoceran species: Daphnia pulex Leydig, 1860 and Simocephalus vetulus (O. F. Muller, 1776) was performed. We hypothesized that the exotic species would be less sensitive than native species. Our hypothesis was fulfilled. Daphnia magna was less sensitive than native species to eight of the nine compounds we analyzed. Results suggest that native species are better adjusted to local environmental conditions, and are more reliable as bioindicators of potential effects of toxicants on aquatic biota. Although the use of D. magna is recommended because of its ample toxicity database, some researchers propose the use of native species for toxicity tests. Therefore, to propose a native species to be considered as a test organism for official toxicity test for tropical countries, there is a need to increase the database of toxicants and to compare the sensitivities of several classes of toxicants with a model organism whose sensitivity to a broad variety of toxicants is well known, like D. magna.

AB  - Under the European Union (EU) energy efficiency targets that Romania has assumed, increasing the share of solar energy has been one of the main points to be considered. The most important solar energy resources are found in the lowlands and low hills in southern and south-eastern parts of the country. The current paper is focused on the Romanian Plain, which has the best environmental conditions to support the development of photovoltaic (PV) farms. One hundred and ten PV farms have been identified and mapped which cover a total area of 1393 hectares. Although it provides a clean and sustainable energy source, the related environmental implications of PV farms could be either positive or negative. In this study, some of the main categories of impacts have been selected for identification and analysis of their environmental consequences. Several indicators have been computed: the share of PV farms from the main land use/cover categories and main soil types, and the distance of PV farms to forests, water bodies, or protected areas. The overall results of the study reveal the current and potential impacts of PV farms in order to understand the interactions between the environment and the use of renewable energy sources and further support science-based solutions for sustainable development.

AB  - Agricultural burning is still a common practice around the world. It is associated with the high emission of air pollutants, including short-term climate change forcing pollutants such as black carbon and PM2.5. The legal requirements to start any regulatory actions to control them is the identification of its area of influence. However, this task is challenging from the experimental and modeling point of view, since it is a short-term event with a moving area source of pollutants. In this work, we assessed this agricultural burning influence-area using the US Environmental authorities recommended air dispersion model (AERMOD). We considered different sizes and geometries of burning areas located on flat terrains, and several crops burning under the worst-case scenario of meteorological conditions. The influence area was determined as the largest area where the short-term concentrations of pollutants (1 h or one day) exceed the local air quality standards. We found that this area is a band around the burning area whose size increases with the burning rate but not with its size. Finally, we suggested alternatives of public policy to regulate this activity, which is based on limiting the burning-rate in the way that no existing households remain inside the resulting influence-area. However, this policy should be understood as a transition towards a policy that forbids agricultural burning.

AB  - By increasing landscape patchiness and habitat loss, urbanization threatens biodiversity. Its adverse effects may be mitigated by urban parks, in which conditions that promote structural and functional biodiversity contribute to preserve ecosystem processes. Therefore, deep knowledge of urban park biodiversity and of patterns driving species assemblages is required, especially for soil communities which are understudied. This study, conducted in public parks in Montpellier (Southern France), is the first one examining the impact of landscape patterns on Collembola communities. Moreover, soil abiotic properties were analyzed to examine how local factors drive species assemblages in different landscape types. The results of the study highlighted that Collembola community structure is affected by landscape patterns. Specifically, Collembola communities with species-abundance structures typical of late successional stages were found within woody landscapes, whereas those with early successional stage structures were observed in wide turf patches surrounded by other vegetation covers. When turf patches become small and isolated, homogenization was observed in Collembola community composition. From the perspective of urban park planning, managers should consider limiting landscape fragmentation (i.e. interspersion and configuration of impervious surfaces) and preserving landscape diversity (especially through woody vegetation patches). These may promote the development of diverse and structured Collembola communities, indicators of the overall soil quality.

AB  - Metal pollutants were detected in biotic (Typha domingensis plant and Chironomus spp. larvae) and abiotic (water and sediment) components along 3 sampling sites in Wadi Al Arj floodplain, Taif Governorate, KSA, during winter and summer seasons 2016-2017. This included measurement of metal concentrations (Cu, Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb, Fe and Al) in water, sediment, T. domingensis and Chironomus spp. samples, calculating metal pollution index (MPI) and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) as well as evaluating the sediment pollution status. Water physico-chemical properties reflected seasonal changes in weather conditions and other related factors. The detected variations in metal concentrations among studied samples showed temporal and spatial related patterns with a general trend to show significant increase during winter season. The calculated MPI performed better in indicating the overall metal load in the studied samples where it showed the order: Chironomus larvae > T. domingensis plant > sediment > water, and confirmed the marked increase in metal concentrations during winter season. Metal concentrations and BAF values for both studied biotic components were in consistence with each other and confirmed the potential use of T. domingensis and Chironomus spp. larvae as possible bio-monitors for metal pollution.

AB  - It is widely known that the same type and strength of hazard could lead to very uneven impacts on different communities due to their varying vulnerability and resilience capacity. Hence, identifying the factors that make a community more resilient to hazards is critical to its sustainability and is central to climate change research and planning. This paper addresses three questions: what is the best way to measure community resilience to disasters and how to identify the key indicators? How do the resilience indicators dynamically interact in a quantitative manner that would lead to long-term resilience? And how can we translate the scientific results into practical tools for decision making? Using the population change pattern in the Mississippi River Delta as a case study, this paper demonstrates the use of a relatively new resilience assessment method called the Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) method to measure resilience. Then, a newly developed spatial dynamic model is used to simulate population changes in the study area. The results show that without any changes in the current condition, the coastal portion of the study area will continue to suffer population loss and the region is unlikely to sustain in the future.

AB  - Currently it is well known that all biological drugs, including those with a fully human structure, are capable of inducing a host immune response known as immunogenicity [1]. The presence of ADAs can condition the drug's level and action, thus modifying the therapeutic effect and even the safety profile by its mechanism of action - neutralizing or non-neutralizing - and / or an increase in its clearance. Immunogenicity is a dynamic factor to be taken into account in biological therapy, especially in long-term treatments, and as a relevant aspect in the assessment of secondary response loss [2]. With the above, not only the knowledge but also the management of the immunogenicity of the different biological treatments, represent a useful instrument for optimization of the strategies of use for each drug, and in the design of predictive models of response, which finally permits a significant improvement in the efficacy and safety profile, aiming to a personalization of the therapies, especially in patients with autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders and cancer [3]. This review summarizes the events of immunogenicity that produce the biological drug, the factor that influence to immunogenicity and the assessment of immunogenicity.

AB  - Energy planning and management in the built environment should not limit their scope to reaching zero-energy or nearly zero-energy balances: they should aim for cost optimality as well. Only then can environmental and economic sustainability be attained;In this study, a set of energy systems that include exchange with electrical and heating grids are proposed for an existing single-family house in Finland. The simulated energy and exergy balances are quantified, as well as the levelized cost of electricity and levelized cost of heat, the simple payback period and the internal rate of return of the investment. By driving a heat pump to convert surplus electricity into heat and exporting it, an annual energy surplus of 36 kWh/m(2)/a is achievable, whereas by importing heat from a heating grid leads to an annual exergy surplus of 8 kWh/m(2)/a. However, the economic indicators are unattractive: the lowest levelized cost of electricity and simple payback period are 41 cent/kWh and 46 years respectively, while the highest internal rate of return is 3.2%. Thus, the results indicate that reaching zero-energy balances in a cost-effective manner in single-family house under the current conditions in Finland is an arduous endeavour. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Flow characteristics past a bileaflet mechanical heart valve were measured under physiological flow conditions in a straight tube with an axisymmetric expansion, similar to vessels used in previous studies, and in an anatomical model of the aorta. We found that anatomical features, including the three-lobed sinus and the aorta's curvature affected significantly the flow characteristics. The turbulent and viscous stresses were presented and discussed as indicators for potential blood damage and thrombosis. Both types of stresses, averaged over the two axial measurement planes, were significantly lower in the anatomical model than in the axisymmetric one. This difference was attributed to the lower height-to-width ratio and more gradual contraction of the anatomical aortic sinus. The curvature of the aorta caused asymmetries in the velocity and stress distributions during forward flow. Secondary flows resulting from the aorta's curvature are thought to have redistributed the fluid stresses transversely, resulting in a more homogeneous stress distribution in the anatomical aortic root than in the axisymmetric root. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of modelling accurately the aortic geometry in experimental and computational studies of prosthetic devices. Moreover, our findings suggest that grafts used for aortic root replacement should approximate as closely as possible the shape of the natural sinuses.

AB  - Cardiovascular variabilities were recognized over 250 years ago, but only in the past 20 years has their apparent utility come to be appreciated. Technological advancement has allowed precise measurement and quantification of short-term cardiovascular fluctuations; however, our understanding of the integrated mechanisms which underlie these oscillations is inadequate for their widespread application. Both autonomic branches, the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, are key determinants of the magnitude of these spontaneous cardiovascular fluctuations. Heart rate variability can be an indicator of an individual cardiovascular condition. In this review, we will discuss the two primary rhythmic oscillations that underlie the complexity of the heart rate waveform. The first oscillation occurs over several cardiac cycles, is respiratory related, and termed respiratory sinus arrhythmia. The second oscillation occurs at an approximate 10 s cycle. Due to the closed-loop nature of the control system of cardiovascular oscillations, it is difficult to define specific relations among cardiovascular variables. In this review, we will present the feedforward and feedback mechanism that underlie both oscillations and their implication as quantitative measures of autonomic circulatory control. We will also review the various methodologies to assess them.

AB  - Aims: Inactivation rates of Escherichia coli in groundwater have most often been determined in aerobic and oxidized systems. This study examined E. coli inactivation rates in anaerobic and extremely reduced groundwater systems that have been identified as recharge zones.
   Methods and Results: Groundwater from six artesian wells was diverted to above-ground, flow-through mesocosms that contained laboratory grown E. coli in diffusion chambers. All groundwater was anaerobic and extremely reduced (ORP < -300 mV). Cells were plated onto mTEC agar during 21-day incubation periods. All data fit a bi-phasic inactivation model, with >95% of the E. coli population being inactivated < 11.0 h (mean k = 0.488 +/- 0.188 h(-1)).
   Conclusions: The groundwater geochemical conditions enhanced the inactivation of E. coli to rates approx. 21-fold greater than previously published inactivation rate in groundwater (mean k = 0.023 +/- 0.030 h(-1)). Also, mTEC agar inhibits E. coli growth following exposure to anaerobic and reduced groundwater.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: Aquifer recharge zones with geochemical characteristics observed in this study complement above-ground engineered processes (e.g. filtration, disinfection), while increasing the overall indicator micro-organism log-reduction rate of a facility.

AB  - Large ultramafic areas exist in Albania, which could be suitable for phytomining with native Alyssummurale. We undertook a five-year field experiment on an ultramafic Vertisol, aimed at optimizing a low-cost Ni-phytoextraction crop of A. murale which is adapted to the Balkans. The following aspects were studied on 18-m(2) plots in natural conditions: the effect of (i) plant phenology and element distribution, (ii) plant nutrition and fertilization, (iii) plant cover and weed control and (iv), planting technique (natural cover vs. sown crop). The optimal harvest time was set at the mid-flowering stage when Ni concentration and biomass yield were highest. The application of N, P, and K fertilizers, and especially a split 100-kg ha(-1) N application, increased the density of A. murale against all other species. It significantly increased shoot yield, without reducing Ni concentration. In natural stands, the control of graminaceous weeds required the use of an anti-monocots herbicide. However, after the optimization of fertilization and harvest time, weed control procured little benefit. Finally, cropping sown A. murale was more efficient than enhancing native stands and gave higher biomass and phytoextraction yields; biomass yields progressively improved from 0.3 to 9.0 t ha(-1) and phytoextracted Ni increased from 1.7 to 105 kg ha(-1).

AB  - To identify parameters that can be used for the analysis of natural variation in leaf senescence of wheat; and to understand the association between the onset and progression of leaf senescence with N uptake and root traits.
   Chlorophyll content and the proportion of yellow leaves were used as senescence indicators and their relation with other morphological and physiological traits were measured in contrasting early senescing (ES) and late senescing (LS) wheat lines.
   There were significant genotype effects on the onset and progress of senescence. The ES lines in which leaf senescence commenced early had significantly lower root biomass and N uptake than LS lines. The strong negative association between the extent of leaf senescence with root biomass and N uptake indicated that the poor root growth induced N limitation caused the early senescence of ES lines.
   The leaf senescence development in ES lines was precocious and constitutive as the trait expressed even under optimal growth conditions suggesting they could be useful in understanding the genetic regulation of senescence under different abiotic stress situations. Accelerated leaf senescence in wheat could be a mechanism to compensate for limitations in the root system that tend to restrict nutrient uptake.

AB  - Field descriptions of ventifacts sculpted in wind-abraded, Albian carbonate rock protrusions are presented in this study, as well as of the closely related, wind-influenced chemical weathering features that interfere or converge morphologically with them. Descriptions of two new ventifacts ("bows" and "pinnacles") are presented. "Bows" compare to the hydrodynamic forward parts of ship hulls, whereas "pinnacles" are sub-circular rounded salients that form clusters in vertical rock faces turned to the wind. Additionally, "sidewall tafoni" are described in non-detrital rocks. The ventifacts are used to identify geomorphically effective winds and to deepen in the knowledge of wind-driven weathering and abrasion processes. These erosional forms (not reported so far in northern Spain) are currently active in sand-dominated beach environments under a humid, temperate climate. Inactive and reactivated forms variably erased by current coastal dynamics are also described. These share the orientation characteristics of the currently active ones, and are interpreted as reflecting unconstrained past wind conditions over decadal or longer timescales. In spite of their interest as paleoenvironmental indicators, the geomorphic associations described exhibit a low preservation potential in the area, and no fossil equivalents have been described so far in older (uplifted or submerged) Quaternary coastal platforms of northern Spain.

AB  - Intense fish farming could affect the microbial quality of marine water in aquacultures and surrounding areas. Our aim in this study was to investigate the influence of several sea bass farms along the Croatian Adriatic coast on the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria (HPC) in marine water as indicator of organic enrichment. For that purpose, substrate SimPlate (R) test was introduced for HPC enumeration in marine water. Optimal conditions for HPC monitoring were established based on comparison of the results obtained at two incubation temperatures (22 and 35 degrees C), as well as comparison of the results obtained by substrate test and by traditional spread plate method. Combination of SimPlate test and incubation temperature of 22 degrees C was best suited for monitoring purposes, since it sustains growth of both naturally present and potentially pathogenic marine bacteria, and enables growth of marine bacteria which cannot grow on solid media. Preliminary assessment of marine water in selected aquacultures (June 2007-October 2008) indicated that farming activities still did not reach critical impact on HPC abundance (0.23x10(3)-1.04x10(5) MPN ml(-4)). However, observed increasing trend of HPCs over the studied period was an indication that marine water in the vicinity of aquacultures should be occasionally monitored for organic pollution.

The present study examines the temporal fluctuations in heat wave occurrence and intensity in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, during the summer period: June, July and August for the years 1931-2012 (except for the most part of the second war period). A site-specific definition of a heat wave was also obtained for the area of Thessaloniki, on the basis of long-term meteorological data. The time-dependent structure of several thermal stress indices shows a distinct pattern of a nearly parabolic behaviour with 2 periods of extreme heat wave episodes (from 1952 to 1957 and after the year 1987) with the peaks of heat wave severity in summers 1934, 1935, 1939, 1945, 1952, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1963, 1968, 1987, 1988, 2000, 2007 and 2012. A very low occurrence of heat waves was typical during the decade of the 1970's. The increasing trends in thermal stress indices, for the last more than 40 years, are perhaps not a proof but an indicator of an extreme event, probably due to the climatic changes.

AB  - Wildland fires are the main cause of tree mortality in Mediterranean Europe and a major threat to Spanish forests. This paper focuses on the design and validation of a new wildland fire index especially adapted to a Mediterranean Spanish region. The index considers ignition and spread danger components. Indicators of natural and human ignition agents, historical occurrence, fuel conditions and fire spread make up the hierarchical structure of the index. Multi-criteria methods were used to incorporate experts' opinion in the process of weighting the indicators and to carry out the aggregation of components into the final index, which is used to map the probability of daily fire occurrence on a 0.5-km grid. Generalised estimating equation models, which account for possible correlated responses, were used to validate the index, accommodating its values onto a larger scale because historical records of daily fire occurrence, which constitute the dependent variable, are referred to cells on a 10-km grid. Validation results showed good index performance, good fit of the logistic model and acceptable discrimination power. Therefore, the index will improve the ability of fire prevention services in daily allocation of resources.

AB  - This study evaluates possible differences in body dimensions among children from matings of different exogamy levels. The cross-sectional sample consisted of 867 children, 435 males, and 432 females, 6-10 years old, attending elementary schools in the metropolitan area of Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia (Italy). The children were divided into two groups according to the level of exogamy. The first group consisted of children of parents born in the same Sardinian municipality and was considered endogamous sensu stricto. The second group included children of parents born in municipalities from different Sardinian linguistic domains and was considered exogamous. The Mann Whitney test did not reveal significant differences between the two groups of children in the mean rank values of the 36 anthropometric variables considered, with the exception of cephalic circumference in males and chest depth in females. In particular, there were no significant differences for anthropometric variables considered to be indirect indicators of nutritional status: sum of skinfolds, waist/hip ratio, body mass index, total upper arm area, upper arm muscle area, and upper arm fat area. The results indicate that Sardinian children from marriages of different exogamy levels do not differ in body dimensions if they grow up with similar nutritional and socioeconomic conditions. Am. J.

AB  - The germination behaviour of two Iberian endemic labiates, Sideritis pungens and S. chamaedryfolia selected from different habitats, ranging from very humid to semi-arid, was studied under controlled experimental conditions. A factorial experiment, combining different temperature regimes (10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, 25 degrees or 30 degrees C), photoperiod (total darkness and 12 h light/12 h darkness) and different pre-treatments (freezing, dry-heat, hot-water), was designed to analyze seed germination patterns and dormancy processes. The. results obtained are in agreement with the ecology of the two species. Seeds are not dormant after collection and maintain high viability when preserved by standard seed bank conservation protocols. It was found out that optimal temperature for germination is 20 degrees C for both species. Light seems to play a key role in the germination of genus Sideritis, particularly for S. chamaedryfolia, significantly inhibited by light as other psammophilous plants. Temperature and light arc relevant environmental indicators, but it was found out that the germination response to these factors in the studied species is correlated with a different environmental factor, namely the availability of water resources in their habitats, which is generally a major constraint factor for seed germination in Mediterranean areas. The results indicate that germination limitations are not so much related to taxonomic position, but rather adaptations to water restrictions.

AB  - The use of multiple spawning fishes in environmental effects monitoring programs has proven difficult for a number of reasons including the inability to predict reproductive investment and ensure synchronous sampling of reference and impacted populations. The estuarine resident northern mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus macrolepidotus) has been successfully used as a sentinel for effects of pulp and paper mill effluents in Atlantic Canada and has been proposed for monitoring other anthropogenic impacts. This study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the somatic parameters used to describe fish performance, specifically measures of energy use and storage, in estuaries located in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Three sites with varying levels of agricultural input were studied. Fish at all sites depleted their energy reserves over winter, as reflected in depressed condition, liver size, and gonad size, but then quickly replenished them in May. These population parameters were highly variable throughout the reproductive season and within an estuary. Spawning was continuous at all sites without indication of lunar or other periodicity. We conclude that repeated sampling is required to assess reproductive output in the northern mummichog and densities of adults and young-of-the-year deserve further investigation as a potentially less logistically demanding indicator of eutrophication.

AB  - Risk assessment of environmental contaminants is usually based on experiments on well-fed individuals held at low population densities. However, field populations are often subject to resource limitation. Individuals who are already stressed by crowding or food limitation may show greater susceptibility to toxicants. But density dependence could also reduce population-level impacts as toxicant-related mortalities may reduce competition for resources. This study examines the joint effects of toxicants and food availability on populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The interactions between the effects of food limitation and toxicant stress were dose dependent and strongly influenced by toxicity mechanisms. In food-limited conditions, a compensatory effect often occurred, with toxicant exposure having a lower proportional impact than at higher food levels. This provides further evidence that density-dependent population processes can produce an assimilative capacity for the effects of toxicants. But synergistic food-toxicant effects were also common and the interaction often switched between synergistic and compensatory at different toxicant concentrations and food supplies. There is no simple "Iess-than-additive", "additive" or "more-than-additive" relationship between density and toxicant effects, even for a single toxicant.. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper summarizes the INTECT process devoted to the recovery of valuable elements from electric arc furnace dust 'EAFD' "in - situ". Acidic leaching of EAFD, separation of solid/liquid, cementation of obtained ZnCl2 solution, precipitation of hydroxy-carbonate, calcinations of Zn-5(CO3)(2)(OH)(6) to obtain ZnO were successful tasks on the laboratory and pilot plant scales. The electrodialysis unit for NaCl splitting, to generate NaOH and HCI, was successful on the laboratory scale, its scaling up to the pilot scale was half success.
   Manufacturing of 400 tons of briquettes devoted to the study the impact of recycling of leaching's solid residue in the electric arc furnace was successful. Results of industrial trials confirm that including briquettes up to 2% of the charge of EAF doesn't modify the quality of the produced steel. The off gases' chemical composition was almost identical to that of normal operations. Moreover, the physico-chemical characteristics of the dust and the slag weren't modified. In addition, the generated dust had a higher content of Zn and there were no modifications of working conditions.
   Environmental assessment of the INTECT process is positive since recycling of EAFD will allow the conservation of mineral and energetic resources and will contribute indirectly to lower the CO2 emission.

AB  - Studies of sediment cores from the Sea of Okhotsk, which is characterized by seasonal sea ice, have shown a large variability of sea ice indicators during the glacial-interglacial cycles. In this study, we apply the relative abundance of the C-37: 4 alkenone to total C-37 alkenones (% C-37: 4) as a molecular indicator of salinity and water masses to further investigate surface oceanographic condition in the Sea of Okhotsk in the glacial period. We found a large fluctuation of % C-37: 4 ( 4 - 35%) with higher values ( 20 similar to 35%) during the last glacial period and lower values (< 8%) during warm periods, suggesting a decreased surface salinity in the glacial period. The variation of % C-37: 4 was found to be consistent with the ice rafted debris (IRD) in the sediment core ( correlation coefficient (r(2)) between % C-37: 4 and IRD: 0.72). This suggests that the duration of seasonal sea ice was longer in the glacial period than today. The lowered surface salinity in the glacial might also have been seriously affected by the close-off of the shallow Soya Strait, which currently transports massive volumes of saline water from the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals and personal care products are omnipresent in wastewater world-wide. In order to predict their sorption quantities onto sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the solid-water distribution coefficients (K-d values) of selected pharmaceuticals (antiphlogistics, estrogens, lipid regulators, anti-epileptic and cytostatic agents) and polycyclic musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) were determined in primary and secondary sludges taken from a German municipal WWTP. For the K-d determination, batches of primary and secondary sludge slurries were spiked with the respective target compounds and slowly stirred under defined conditions (e.g. an argon atmosphere). Finally, the water and solid sludge phases were analysed. The K-d values of pharmaceuticals ranged from < 1 to 500 L kg(-1), while those for the polycyclic musk fragrances AHTN and HHCB proved to be up to 5300 and 4900 L kg(-1), respectively. The primary and secondary sludge showed significant differences for some pharmaceuticals such as Diclofenac and Cyclophosphamide due to the different pH and composition of the two sludges. The removal rate from the water phase caused by sorption in a WWTP can be reasonably predicted on the basis of the Kd values. (C)(C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The thermal stability of the recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) expressed by Escherichia coli cells and isolated by three-phase partitioning extraction with hydrophobic interaction chromatography was studied. The GFPuv (3.5-9.0 mug of GFPuv/mL) was exposed to various pH conditions (4.91-9.03) and temperatures (75-95degreesC) in the 10 mM buffers: acetate (pH 5.0-7.0), phosphate (pH 5.5-8.0), and Tris-HCl (pH 7.0-9.0). The extent of protein denaturation (loss of fluorescence intensity) was expressed in decimal reduction time (D-value), the time exposure required to reduce 90% of the initial fluorescence intensity of GFPuv. For pH 7.0 to 8.0, the thermostability of GFPuv was slightly greater in phosphate buffer than in Tris-HCl. At 85degreesC, the D-values (pH 7.1-7.5) ranged from 7.24 (Tris-HCl) to 13.88 min (phosphate). The stability of GFPuv in Tris-HCl (pH > 8.0) was constant at 90 and 95degreesC, and the D-values were 7.93 (pH 8.38-8.92) and 6.0 min (pH 8.05-8.97), respectively. The thermostability of GFPuv provides the basis for its potential utility as a fluorescent biologic indicator to assay the efficacy of moist-heat treatments at temperatures lower than 100degreesC.

AB  - We quantified the chlorophyll a content of planktonic algae and benthic algae in periphyton on acrylic rods and in epiphyton growing on macrophytes in 24 coastal wetlands in all five Laurentian Great Lakes. Sites were selected to represent a wide range of environmental conditions ranging from nutrient-poor, clear-water marshes with abundant macrophytes to nutrient-enriched, turbid systems devoid of aquatic vegetation. Water quality and species and percent cover of submergent macrophytes were measured in each wetland. Principal components analysis (PCA) showed that total phosphorus, turbidity, and suspended solids, variables associated with human-induced degradation, were most strongly correlated with PC axis 1 (PC1), accounting for 69% of the total variation. The PC1 site score was significantly related to both periphyton and phytoplankton biomass, respectively accounting for 54 and 70% of the total variation in periphyton and phytoplankton data, whereas PC1 only accounted for 18% of the variation in epiphyton biomass. Periphytic and epiphytic biomass were negatively correlated with percent cover and species richness of submergent macrophytes, but phytoplankton biomass was not. We conclude that periphytic and planktonic chlorophyll a biomass are good indicators of human-induced water-quality degradation and recommend that both benthic and planktonic algal biomass should be routinely monitored as part of an effective wetland management program.

AB  - A regression model is introduced to estimate a trend and, possibly time-dependent, regression coefficients simultaneously.  The model is meant to detect time-dependencies in the response of tree growth to environmental conditions.  The existing models in this field usually ignore these time evolutions.
   The trend is modeled via a doubly differencing scheme, while the regression coefficients, i.e., the response function, may vary in a nearly arbitrary, stochastic way.  The estimation is performed via the discrete Kalman filter.  Unknown noise variances, which control the flexibility in time of the stochastic parameters, are estimated using maximum likelihood optimization.
   The model is applied to four ring-width chronologies of European silver firs (Abies alba Mill.) in the Bavarian Forest, Germany.  Monthly averaged temperatures and monthly sums of precipitation are used as explanatory variables, together with an index series of SO2 emissions in the former Federal Republic of Germany.  The latter variable is argued to be a reliable pollution indicator.  It appears that the dramatic growth variations of silver firs since 1960 cannot solely be explained by meterological variables.  Furthermore, a strong relationship is found between the high frequency parts of both the ring-width signal and the SO2 emission series since 1945.

AB  - Water quality is continuously affected by anthropogenic and environmental conditions. A significant issue of the Indian rivers is the massive water pollution, leading to the spreading of different diseases due to its daily use. Therefore, this study investigates three aspects. The first one is testing the hypothesis of the existence of a monotonic trend of the series of eight water parameters of the Brahmaputra River recorded for 17 years at ten hydrological stations. When this hypothesis was rejected, a loess trend was fitted. The second aspect is to assess the water quality using three indicators (WQI)-CCME WQI, British Colombia, and a weighted index. The third aspect is to group the years and the stations in clusters used to determine the regional (spatial) and temporal trend of the WQI series, utilizing a new algorithm. A statistical analysis does not reject the hypothesis of a monotonic trend presence for the spatially distributed data but not for the temporal ones. Hierarchical clustering based on the computed WQIs detected two clusters for the spatially distributed data and two for the temporal-distributed data. The procedure proposed for determining the WQI temporal and regional evolution provided good results in terms of mean absolute error, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

AB  - Real-time monitoring of energetic-environmental parameters in wastewater treatment plants enables big-data analysis for a true representation of the operating condition of a system, being still frequently mismanaged through policies based on the analysis of static data (energy billing, periodic chemical-physical analysis of wastewater). Here we discuss the results of monitoring activities based on both offline ( "static ") data on the main process variables, and on-line ( "dynamic ") data collected through a monitoring system for energetic-environmental parameters (dissolved oxygen, wastewater pH and temperature, TSS intake and output). Static-data analysis relied on a description model that employed statistical normalization techniques (KPIs, operational indicators). Dynamic data were statistically processed to explore possible correlations between energetic-environmental parameters, establishing comparisons with static data. Overall, the system efficiently fulfilled its functions, although it was undersized compared to the organic and hydraulic load it received. From the dynamic-data analysis, no correlation emerged between energy usage of the facility and dissolved oxygen content of the wastewater, whereas the TSS removal efficiency determined through static measurements was found to be underestimated. Finally, using probes allowed to characterize the pattern of pH and temperature values of the wastewater, which represent valuable physiological data for innovative and sustainable resource recovery technologies involving microorganisms.</p>

AB  - Crop yields are threatened by global climate change. Maize has high water requirements, and precipitation fluctuations can impact its yield. In this study, we used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to simulate maize yields in eight northeastern U.S. states. We used precipitation fluctuations and the coefficient of variation (CV) of yield as indicators to construct a vulnerability curve for the CV of yield and precipitation fluctuations. We then evaluated the vulnerability of maize yields under precipitation fluctuations in the region. We obtained the following results: (1) the fitted vulnerability curves were classified into three categories (positive slope, negative slope, and insignificant fit), of which the first category accounted for about 92.7%, indicating that the CV of maize yield was positively correlated with precipitation fluctuations in most parts of the study area; and (2) the CV of maize yield under 11 precipitation fluctuation scenarios was mapped to express the CV at the spatial level, and the maize yield in Connecticut and Maryland proved to be the most sensitive to precipitation fluctuations. This study provided a theoretical and experimental basis for the prevention of maize yield risk under fluctuating precipitation conditions.

AB  - Soil moisture stress has become a serious environmental limitation to crop productivity and quality. The root system is the first organ sensing the changes in soil moisture; therefore, root development under water deficit is an important indicator for plant's drought tolerance. Previous studies focused on quinoa varietal differences in morphological traits under water stress; however, variation in root development including both growth and diameter responses to drought remains largely unclear. We conducted a preliminary screening of a diverse set of 30 quinoa genotypes to evaluate genetic variation in growth and yield performance in response to drought stress. Variation in drought tolerance indices showed large variation across the quinoa collection. Based on these results, five genotypes representative of a range of drought tolerance levels including 2-Want, Atlas, NL-6, Pichaman and Sayana were selected to evaluate root development under control and severe drought conditions. Inhibition of root development was found for all genotypes as compared to controls; however, significant variation in root growth response to drought stress was observed. Among genotypes, Atlas and 2-Want expressed drought-tolerant phenotypes. The analysis of the interrelations between genotypes root length, root diameter, root surface area, drought tolerance and geographical origins reveals interesting guidelines for further studies to explore the mechanisms behind quinoa roots adaptation to drought.

AB  - The rheological behavior of viscoelastic fluids in the vicinity of singular points, where stress and pressure tend to infinity due to the abrupt change in boundary conditions, such as die lips or sharp edge corners of re-entrant flow, is not yet fully understood. We have developed sector singular elements, that are placed in a small core around the singularity, and are suitable for finite element analysis of viscoelastic fluids; such finite elements have been previously reported for Newtonian flow problems. Each element has special interpolation functions along its radial direction which take into account the nature of the singularity, and conventional elements are used in the rest of the domain. The problem was solved by a 'decoupled method', which alternatively solves the velocity-pressure fields and the stress field, in combination with several numerical techniques to enhance the upper limits of the Weissenberg number. Compared to the conventional FEM, the sector singular finite element method is better at yielding smoother results even near the singularity, but poorer at convergency, and requires a larger amount of system core memory due to its more complicated topology. These disadvantages represent serious problems for multi-mode and/or 3D flow simulation of viscoelastic fluids. Therefore, we developed a modified version of the sector singular finite element method for the purpose of improving the simulation performance.

AB  - The Progress Station is the largest Russian Antarctic station. The anthropogenic impact on primary soils in the area of this station is reflected in the chemical structure of soils and structure of microbial communities. The article shows a multiple increase in the number of microorganisms (especially microscopic fungi) in contaminated soils around the Progress Station. The anthropogenic impact changes the structure of complexes of soil microorganisms. The proportion of mesophilic microorganisms significantly increases under these conditions. Fifty-three micromycete species of 28 genera have been identified in samples of primary soils and anthropogenic substrates. Their diversity decreases from the anthropogenic soils and anthropogenic substrates to the control ("clean") soils. It is shown that an increase in the number of micromycete species in the area of the polar station results from the invasion of new micromycete species due to human activities. Some native species of micromycetes can adapt to anthropogenic substrates and can be destructors of different introduced materials. Over 56 and 70% among micromycetes from the contaminated soils and anthropogenic substrates, respectively, can be considered potentially pathogenic species. Therefore, invasive processes change the structure of complexes of soil micromycetes, which can serve as an indicator of anthropogenic impact on ecosystems in the Larsemann Hills oasis in East Antarctica.

AB  - In coal-dominated regions, hydrogen by-product from refineries can be used to replace coal as heating fuel. This can be a viable method for reducing CO2 emissions. Given that hydrogen injection into existing natural gas pipeline networks is an economical way to utilise this clean gas, this paper explores its benefits by studying its supply chain optimisation and analysing its reliability. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimise transport and dissatisfaction costs. Material balance, supply and transport of natural gas, operation of pipeline networks, and hydrogen injection are considered as constraints. The operating plans of a regional natural gas supply chain (NGSC), with and without hydrogen injection, are optimised. Then, three types of indicators - economic indices, coal and hydrogen as percentages of total energy consumption, and CO2 emissions - are applied to compare the performance of the NGSC in different situations. A case verifies the proposed model and shows the influence of utilising hydrogen in an NGSC. The optimal operating plans under one standard and two nonstandard conditions are calculated, and the reliability of the supply chain is analysed. Results illustrate that injecting hydrogen in the NGSC is beneficial in reducing CO2 emissions and operating costs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Filifactor alocis, a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, is now a proposed diagnostic indicator of periodontal disease. Because the stress response of this bacterium to the oxidative environment of the periodontal pocket may impact its pathogenicity, an understanding of its oxidative stress resistance strategy is vital. Interrogation of the F. alocis genome identified the HMPREF0389_00796 gene that encodes for a putative superoxide reductase (SOR) enzyme. SORs are non-heme, iron-containing enzymes that can catalyze the reduction of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and are important in the protection against oxidative stress. In this study, we have functionally characterized the putative SOR (FA796) from F. alocis ATCC 35896. The recombinant FA796 protein, which is predicted to be a homotetramer of the 1Fe-SOR class, can reduce superoxide radicals. F. alocis FLL141 (FA796::ermF) was significantly more sensitive to oxygen/air exposure compared to the parent strain. Sensitivity correlated with the level of intracellular superoxide radicals. Additionally, the FA796-defective mutant had increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-induced stress, was inhibited in its ability to form biofilm and had reduced survival in epithelial cells. Collectively, these results suggest that the F. alocis SOR protein is a key enzymatic scavenger of superoxide radicals and protects the bacterium from oxidative stress conditions.

AB  - Recent discussions on the natural resource curse theory have expanded from looking at economic and sociopolitical developments to focusing on the impact of natural resources on the spread of, and deaths from, infectious diseases. However, consensus on a link between natural resources and infectious diseases rarely exists, and empirical results are mixed at best. This paper attempts to re-explore such a link by focusing on malaria, a major infectious disease. We argue that in resource-rich countries the reluctance of governments to invest in human capital, rampant corruption and weakened state capacity, and inferior hygiene conditions in mining and drilling areas lead to higher numbers of cases of malaria. To provide empirical support, we apply different natural resource measures, and examine their impacts on the number of cases of infection and death from malaria for the period 2000-2014. Statistical results largely confirm our observations that natural resource abundance is positively associated with a higher number of incidences of and deaths from malaria. These results hold with alternative malaria and resource indicators, and model specifications. The results also have policy implications for malaria control, global public health, and natural resource management. (C) 2018 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Tierra del Fuego Island hosts the largest area of peatlands in the Southern Hemisphere, largely encompassing peat bogs where peat is actively formed and thus acting as carbon sinks. Under a scenario of increasing human pressure, the development of scientific tools for the characterization and monitoring of these systems is highly relevant. Desmids have been used as bioindicators in wetlands on account of their high sensitivity to changes in the environment. Here we identified the main drivers of periphytic and planktonic desmid communities in two Fuegian peat bogs, hosting two types of aquatic environments: clear and vegetated pools. Although peat bogs differed in overall species richness and diversity for both communities, some clear trends were detected regarding their dependence on environmental conditions. Unexpectedly, the taxonomic composition of the periphytic desmids did not depend on the substrate. Instead, their diversity and species richness changed along a minero-ombrotrophic gradient. As for planktonic desmids, their abundance and life strategy jointly changed from few large-sized species to larger numbers of small-sized species along with terrestrialization stage of the pools. We conclude that both desmid communities can be used complementarily to monitor changes over time in the trophic and terrestrialization status of peat bog pools.

AB  - An optical biosensor employing immobilized haloalkane dehalogenase (HLD), the halide degrading enzyme for the detection of halogenated organic in environmental water and drinking water samples was developed. The enzymatic biosensor was fabricated by incorporating H+ ion selective chromoionophore ETH5294 and HID enzyme in a stacked chitosan films system on a glass slide. Hydrolytic dehalogenation of dichloroethane (DCA) by the carbon-halide degrading HLD enzyme resulting in the release of a halogen, a proton and a primary alcohol. The halocarbon concentration was optically transduced by the pH transducer layer as a result of protonation reaction of the chromoionophore pH indicator dye embedded in the underneath layer. The resulting colour change of the protonated chromoionophore was measured by fiber optic reflectance spectrophotometry method. Under optimized conditions the detection limit of the proposed reflectance-based enzymatic biosensor membrane was estimated to be 1 mg L-1 with a wide dynamic linear concentration range of 5-60 mg L-1 DCA (R-2 = 0.9792) and satisfactory reproducibility within the relative standard deviation (RSD) range of 3.4-4.3%. Validation test demonstrated that the optical halocarbon biosensor could be a promising tool for rapid (6 min) in situ and direct evaluation of organohalide in river water, tap water and bottled water samples without any sample pre-treatment or extraction steps.

AB  - All vegetation colonies have layered structure. This layer is called 'forest vertical structure.' Nowadays it is considered as an important indicator to estimate forest's vital condition, diversity and environmental effect of forest. So forest vertical structure should be surveyed. However, vertical structure is a kind of inner structure, so forest surveys are generally conducted through field surveys, a traditional forest inventory method which costs plenty of time and budget. Therefore, in this study, we propose a useful method to classify the vertical structure of forests using remote sensing aerial photographs and machine learning capable of mass data mining in order to reduce time and budget for forest vertical structure investigation. We classified it as SVM (Support Vector Machine) using RGB airborne photos and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) DSM (Digital Surface Model) DTM (Digital Terrain Model). Accuracy based on pixel count is 66.22% when compared to field survey results. It is concluded that classification accuracy of layer classification is relatively high for single-layer and multi-layer classification, but it was concluded that it is difficult in multi-layer classification. The results of this study are expected to further develop the field of machine learning research on vegetation structure by collecting various vegetation data and image data in the future.

AB  - Wireless biosensor systems were developed in our lab for monitoring blood glucose concentrations in fish as an indicator of fish stress. However, uniform immobilization of the enzyme on the surface of the electrode is difficult, so the sensor response is typically reduced at a range of high glucose concentrations during the stress monitoring. In this study, we attempted to enhance sensor response by using a self-assembled monolayer-immobilized enzyme. Glucose oxidase was immobilized on a working electrode modified with a self-assembled monolayer. The proposed biosensor showed a good correlation between the output current and the glucose concentration range of 10-3500 mg dL(-1) under an optimized working condition. The dynamic measurement range of this newly developed sensor is significantly improved, especially over a high concentration range, which helps the sensor to achieve better performance in dramatic changes in the stress response of fish. In addition, we used biological samples from test fish and obtained a good correlation coefficient between the sensor output current and the glucose concentration using a conventional method. The proposed wireless biosensor system was also applied to monitor fish stress responses in real time through different stressors and to obtain some precise data that reflect real fish stress responses.

AB  - Aim: Most of the Indian consumers hitherto invouge prefer to procure the fish in retail markets despite of its poor unhygienic condition. Hence; multiyear environmental study was carried out to scrutinize the hygienic status byfaecal indicator estimation in retail markets of Navi Mumbai region.
   Methodology: In total, 159 marine fish were collected and analysed for estimation of aerobic plate count and faecal indicator bacteria viz., E. coil, faecal streptococci and sulphite reducing clostridia.
   Results: Aerobic plate counts of all fish were within the limit; but the level of E. coil was higher in retail fish i.e., 22.4%. The average level of E. coil, faecal streptococci and sulphite reducing clostridia were 14, 31, 15 cfu g(-1) respectively. Higher ratio was observed between the faecal streptococci and E. col i i.e., 1:0.45.
   Interpretation: Fish in retail markets harbour noteworthy number of faecal indicator bacteria which indicates considerable number of faecal contamination and poor hygienic status of the retail market. Repeated use of same water for washing fish may be reason for the elevated level of contamination. So, cleaning of fish with potable water may reduce contamination. In addition, these retail markets need to be monitored by the controlling authority at regular intervals with stringent control policy in order to provide safe seafood.

AB  - The structural attributes of an old-growth forest remnant of Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii located in southern Spain and those from nearby managed forests were compared. Data on environmental and structural variables were collected in 74 forest inventory plots. Significant differences were tested by means of the Mann-Whitney U-test. A partial redundancy analysis was conducted to assess the relative contribution of both environmental and management variables in explaining differences in the current structure of old-growth and managed stands. Additionally, 25 trees of different size (range 25.4-98 cm) and age (67-803 years) were cored and dendrochronological methods and bootstrap linear regression were used to study the effects of size and age on tree growth. The old-growth stand exhibited a higher density of large trees (diameter at breast height >50 cm) and greater variability in tree size than managed stands, but lower tree density and, consequently, similar values of stand basal area and volume. Environmental variables accounted for 5.7 per cent of the total variance observed in structural attributes, while the contrasting silvicultural condition (old-growth vs managed) accounted for 10.2 per cent. Growth, measured in units of stand basal area, increased continuously with tree size.

AB  - The Paleozoic Bayazeh ophiolite is situated in the western part of the Central-East Iranian microcontinent (CEIM). This ophiolite consists of serpentinised peridotites, metagabbros, metamorphosed ultrabasic dykes, metapicrites, serpentinites and metamorphosed listwaenites which are covered by Late Paleozoic schists and marbles. The unique petrological characteristic of this ophiolite is due to regional metamorphism, which produced listwaenites by carbonation of serpentinites. The mineral association of the Bayazeh metamorphosed listwaenites is represented by amphiboles (tremolite and actinolite), carbonates (dolomite and calcite), quartz, serpentine (antigorite), chromian spinel, ferritchromite and chlorite (pycnochlorite). The main textures are nematoblastic and granoblastic. Rock-forming minerals and the association of the outcrops with serpentinites indicate that the amphibole-bearing listwaenites were generated by regional metamorphism of serpentinites. The mineral assemblage of these rocks and the chemical composition of chromian spinels and amphiboles reveal that these minerals were metamorphosed under upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies P-T conditions.
   Relicts of well-preserved chromian spinel cores in the studied rocks were used as a petrogenetic indicator. The high Cr and Mg values, together with the low Fe3+ and Ti contents of the serpentinite chromian spinels confirm their magmatic nature. The chemical characteristics of the investigated chromian spinels suggest that the protolith should have been a harzburgite belonging to a supra-subduction zone geotectonic setting.

AB  - Stormwater retention ponds are ubiquitous in urban and suburban landscapes of the United States. Most studies of the microbiology of these ponds have focused on the abundance and removal efficiency of fecal indicator bacteria. Here we provide the first comprehensive study of microbial community diversity and activity in these ponds, and assess how different environmental and engineering factors influence these communities. Watershed land-use had no grouping effect on pond geochemistry or biology. Instead, we found that microbial community composition and activity were best explained by site-specific environmental variables. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that bacterial community structure varied greatly across sampled ponds, and appeared to be the result of autochthonous bacterial growth and not simply surface runoff. Metagenomic sequencing of pond viral communities suggested that viral taxa were influenced by external inputs, with viromes composed of bacteriophage that infect environmental bacteria, as well as viruses that infect eukaryotes and phages that infect bacteria pathogenic to eukaryotes. Collectively, our results indicate that the environmental conditions and microbial communities of these ponds vary greatly, even among ponds in close spatial proximity, and that pond microbial communities appear to be shaped by site-specific environmental factors.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) practices have been widely applied on a variety of agro-ecosystems in order to prevent soil degradation and to improve fertility. We studied the long term influence of different management systems on soil properties in an experimental field located in semiarid central Spain. Soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil basal respiration (CO2-C), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and beta-glucosidase activity have been measured during three cropping seasons. Results showed a high influence of date of sampling on the evaluated parameters and on the microbial status and activity, most likely due to variations in soil water content (SWC). Microbial efficiency and beta-glucosidase activity were improved under CA, as SOC, DOC and MBC were accumulated in the surface. Microbial efficiency ratios, e.g., qR (qR = MBC/SOC), qCO(2) (qCO(2) = CO2-C/MBC) and qCO(2)/SOC, were useful to explain the influence of sampling date and the management practices on the microbial status. A stepwise procedure reduced considerably our data set, allowing the selection of MBC, DOC and qCO(2)/SOC as reliable indicators to evaluate soil quality in semiarid areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The paper reports the range extension of the Ponto-Caspian gammarid Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1894) and the first occurrence of this species in new areas of the Polish part of the Baltic Sea basin: the Smiala Vistula and the Vistula Lagoon. The studies additionally determine the osmoregulatory ability of the species under laboratory conditions within the salinity range of 2-22 PSU. Determination of the osmoregulation of the species shows that D. villosus is a hyperregulator at given experimental salinities and can function in a wide range of external salinities so it is potentially able to colonize various water bodies. Osmoregulatory capacity, which is an indicator of organism's efforts to regulate the concentration of its body fluids, shows that for individuals from the Gulf of Gdansk, 6 PSU is the best tolerated salinity. Osmoregulatory capacity is the lowest at this salinity value.
   The range extension and potential osmoregulatory abilities of the species to spread to other waters are discussed in the context of pollution levels given in the literature with reference to the habitat and sensitivity of the species to e.g. fluoride and cadmium toxicity.

AB  - Environmental stochasticity is an important concept in population dynamics, providing a quantitative model of the extrinsic fluctuations driving population abundances. It is typically formulated as a stochastic perturbation to the maximum reproductive rate, leading to a population variance that scales quadratically with abundance. However, environmental fluctuations may also drive changes in the strength of density dependence. Very few studies have examined the consequences of this alternative model formulation while even fewer have tested which model better describes fluctuations in animal populations. Here we use data from the Global Population Dynamics Database to determine the statistical support for this alternative environmental variance model in 165 animal populations and test whether these models can capture known population-environment interactions in two well-studied ungulates. Our results suggest that variation in the density dependence is common and leads to a higher-order scaling of the population variance. This scaling will often stabilize populations although dynamics may also be destabilized under certain conditions. We conclude that higher-order environmental variation is a potentially ubiquitous and consequential property of animal populations. Our results suggest that extinction risk estimates may often be overestimated when not properly taking into account how environmental fluctuations affect population parameters.

AB  - The zonation of depressional and riparian wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of northeastern China was studied to describe their vegetation composition and environmental variables. We sampled 108 plots in 6 depression and riparian wetlands. Samples were classified into 4 groups using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Emergent marsh vegetation was characterized by Carex lasiocarpa and C. pseudocuraica, meadow marsh vegetation by tussock species such as Carex appendiculata and C. meyeriana, wet meadow vegetation by Calamangrostis angustifolia and Carex appendiculata, and shrub meadow vegetation by the shrubs Betula fruticosa, Alnus sibirica and Salix rosmarinifolia and the graminids Carex schmidtii and Calamagrostis angustifolia. CCA ordination showed that water table, organic matter and available N were the major factors explaining the vegetation zonation pattern. Compared with other Northern Hemisphere regions, bog and fen vegetation are completely absent due to climatic conditions unfavorable for peat formation. Out of four vegetation types, only the Carex lasiocarpa community and the C. pseudo-curaica community have been found in other regions. However, at the species level many species are widespread and some species are vicariant or pseudovicariant to other regions in the world. Our study suggests that topography and hydrology may be the most important determinants of the vegetation pattern in this region.

AB  - This article defines the term surrogate as an organism, particle, or substance used to study the fate of a pathogen in a specific environment. Pathogenic organisms, nonpathogenic organisms, and innocuous particles have been used as surrogates for a variety of purposes, including studies on survival and transport as well as for method development and as "indicators" of certain conditions. This article develops a qualitative surrogate attribute prioritization process and allows investigators to select a surrogate by systematically detailing the experimental process and prioritizing attributes. The results are described through the use of case studies of various laboratories that have used this process. This article also discusses the history of surrogate and microbial indicator use and outlines the method by which surrogates can be used when conducting a quantitative microbial risk assessment. The ultimate goal of selecting a sufficiently representative surrogate is to improve public health through a health-based risk assessment framework. Under-or overestimating the resistance, inactivation, or movement may negatively impact risk assessments that, in turn, will impact health assessments and estimated safety levels. Reducing uncertainty in a risk assessment is one of the objectives of using surrogates and the ultimate motive for any experiment investigating potential exposure of a pathogen.

AB  - We used experimental cattle ungrazed and grazed sites to evaluate what impact different intensities of cattle grazing have on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845)) and meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus (Ord, 1815)). Live-trapping of these small rodents was conducted on paired treatment plots (grazed and ungrazed) at Sheep River Provincial Park in southwestern Alberta, Canada. Before grazing started, both rodent species were equally abundant in either grazed or ungrazed sites. Introduction of grazing resulted in strong but differing responses by both rodent species. Deer mice had higher population density (measured as individual animals trapped) in the grazed than in ungrazed plots, but their body mass was negatively correlated with increasing grazing pressure. Meadow voles were more heavily affected by grazing, as a strong avoidance of cattle-grazed plots was observed already at low grazing intensity. In addition, cattle grazing had noticeable effects, impacting the survival, sex and age ratios, and the ectoparasite prevalence of these two rodent populations. We conclude that there are diverse and different levels of impact of cattle grazing on those two rodents, leading to much more complex species interactions than previously thought. We suggest that the presence or absence, density, and body condition of small mammals could be used as a tool for ecosystem health assessment.

AB  - The ability of soil to function as a barrier between microbial pathogens in wastes and groundwater following application of animal wastes is dependent on soil structure. We irrigated soil lysimeters with dairy shed effluent at intervals of 3-4 months and monitored microbial indicators (somatic coliphage, faecal enterococci, Escherichia coli) in soil core leachates for 1 year. The lysimeters were maintained in a lysimeter facility under natural soil temperature and moisture regimes. Microbial indicators were rapidly transported to depth in well-structured Netherton clay loam soil. Peak concentrations of E. coli and somatic coliphage were detected immediately following dairy shed effluent application to Netherton clay loam soil, and E. coli continued to leach from the soil following rainfall. In contrast, microbial indicators were rarely detected in leachates from fine-structured Manawatu sandy loam soil. Potential for leaching was dependent on soil moisture conditions in Manawatu soil but not Netherton soil, where leaching occurred regardless. Dye studies confirmed that E. coli can be transported to depth by flow through continuous macropores in Netherton soils. However, in the main E. coli was retained in topsoil of Netherton and Manawatu soil.

AB  - The oxygen isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera tests is one of the widest used geochemical tools to reconstruct past changes of physical parameters of the upper ocean. It is common practice to analyze multiple individuals from a mono-specific population and assume that the outcome reflects a mean value of the environmental conditions during calcification of the analyzed individuals. Here we present the oxygen isotope composition of individual specimens of the surface-dwelling species Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerina bulloides from sediment cores in the Western Arabian Sea off Somalia, inferred as indicators of past seasonal ranges in temperature. Combining the delta O-18 measurements of individual specimens to obtain temperature ranges with Mg/Ca based mean calcification temperatures allows us to reconstruct temperature extrema. Our results indicate that over the past 20 kyr the seasonal temperature range has fluctuated from its present value of 16 degrees C to mean values of 13 degrees C and 11 degrees C for the Holocene and LGM, respectively. The data for the LGM suggest that the maximum temperature was lower, whilst minimum temperature remained approximately constant. The rather minor variability in lowest summer temperatures during the LGM suggests roughly constant summer monsoon intensity, while upwelling-induced productivity was lowered.

AB  - Mongolia is an arid land with limited freshwater availability. Recent changes in climate as well as changes in livestock management in the post-Soviet era may threaten the quality and availability of these freshwater resources and emphasize the need to characterize current conditions relative to a long-term baseline. Because diatoms are responsive to changes in water chemistry and are commonly preserved in lake sediments, they can be used as indicators of both present and past water quality. To these ends, we have developed a diatom-based calibration set and quantitative inference models for the region. Physical and chemical factors and modern diatom communities were sampled at 54 sites in western Mongolia in the Altai and Khangai mountains and the Valley of the Great Lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that both salinity and total phosphorus accounted for statistically significant fractions of the variation in 151 diatom taxa across the 54 sampled sites. Diatom-based inference models were developed with weighted averaging (WA) techniques and showed strong predictive capabilities and low prediction errors for salinity and total phosphorus. These models are now available to help identify and interpret historical and future disturbances to this sensitive and globally important eco-region.

AB  - Epiphytic algae occurring on submerged macrophytes were investigated as part of a study on the ecological status of a shallow macrophyte- dominated lake, Lake Skomielno, which has been used for recreation and fishery. Relatively high variability in biomass (DM) and chlorophyll a contents in epiphyton on particular plants was noted. Generally, the biomass of epiphytic algae was much higher in spring and autumn than in summer. In total, 335 taxa were found on the studied macrophytes with representatives of the Chlorophyta (143 taxa) and Heterokontophyta class Bacillariophyceae (131 taxa) dominating. The species composition of epiphytic algae was related to host plant and seasons, the highest species richness was observed on Stratiotes aloides in spring and on Potamogeton lucens in autumn. The Jaccard similarity index revealed differentiation of diatom communities between the macrophytes. Our data suggest that in the studied lake S. aloides and P. lucens can provide better habitat conditions for higher numbers of epiphytic taxa, abundances and epiphyton standing crop than Ceratophyllum demersum and Chara spp. can. The dominance of diatom species (e. g. Pseudostaurosira brevistriata (Grun.) Williams & Round, Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutz.) Czarnecki, and Cocconeis placentula Ehrenb.) that are known as bioindicators of slightly alkaline, sufficiently oxygen-saturated and meso-eutrophic waters corresponds well with the physico-chemical parameters of Lake Skomielno.

AB  - Stratigraphical investigations, geomorphological mapping, and diatom, plant macro-fossil and pollen analyses were undertaken in and around two lakes in central Ireland to establish correlations between changes in lake conditions and catchment vegetation throughout the Holocene. Similar investigations of an adjacent mire reveal early Holocene changes in lake level and area. The palaeoecological data show high correlations related to variations in lake depth and area, catchment vegetation type, organic inputs and trophic status. Catchment-scale deforestation is gradual and occurs through the Bronze and the Iron Ages, and the construction of a crannog in the early Medieval period (seventh century AD) appears to be associated with a widespread increase in deforestation and mixed agriculture in the catchment. Both pollen and plant macrofossils suggest that one of the crannogs was used for crop storage in addition to domestic and any other activities. In the early to middle Holocene similarities in the proxy-data appear to be climatically driven through changing lake levels and areal extent whereas the later Holocene record is clearly dominated by anthropogenic changes within the catchment and the construction of crannogs in the lakes. The advantages of combining multi-proxy indicators of lake hydroecology with the vegetation record are illustrated. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Thirty-eight farms from three of the four climatological zones defining rainfall in the Valley of Cauto (Granma) were selected to study the factors affecting the productive efficiency of dual-purpose cattle production. A survey with variables characterizing the performance of technological and ecological processes was applied in each farm to determine the productive efficiency of the herds studied. The methods of multivariate factorial analysis and main components, were used to search for the most affecting factors on the productive performance of the herds. Conglomerate analyses were carried out to group the farms. Position and dispersion statistics were determined to study the influence of number of paddocks, grazing methods, stocking rate and variants of these methods on milk production in the evaluated farms. Herd productivity depended on two factors accounting for 85 % of the total variance: organization of the production and grazing management ability. The most relevant variables were: number of paddocks; grazing method, body condition of the herd, management of the records; night grazing time, grazing hours, biomass production and feeding efficiency. The efficiency in the farms increased as the exploitation system was intensified. The herds under rational grazing showed better productive indicators than the rest of the methods evaluated.

AB  - This work was undertaken to study the influence of soil type and chemical composition on uranium sorption ratios (SR in 1 kg(-1)) in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with this parameter in risk assessment models. Thirteen soil samples were collected from three different locations in France under different geological conditions. Clay content varied from 7.0 to 50.0%, pH ranged from 5.5 to 8.8 and organic matter content from 1.0 to 4.6%. Soils were incubated at room temperature in polyethylene packets for 28 days in the presence of 1 mg U kg(-1) soil. Sorption ratio values varied from 0.9 to 3198 for all soils with no significant effect of soil texture or of organic matter. However, soil pH was highly linearly correlated with (log SR) as a probable consequence of the existence of different uranium complexes as a function of soil pH. The sorption behaviour differences between UO22+ and UO22+-carbonate complexes are so great that any other effect of soil properties on U sorption is hidden. Thus, soil pH should be the focus variable for reduction of the uncertainty associated with the soil Kd value used in environmental risk assessments, even for reducing the uncertainty in site-specific Kd values.

AB  - Partial redundancy analysis was applied to assess the effects of sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition on epiphytic green algae (mainly Protococcus viridis) on Picea abies needles. Data were collected from 15 sites over the country during 12 years by the Swedish National Environmental Monitoring Program (PMK). The green algae colony thickness and colonization rate depend on three intercorrelated environmental variable groups, namely, geographic location, climatic condition and S and N deposition. The collinearity between the environmental variables complicates the assessment of deposition-induced impact. The total explained variation within algae distribution patterns (eigenvalue = 0.811 as 100 per cent) was partitioned among the three environmental variable groups. Analysis showed that a large part of the explained variation (67 per cent) was due to the joint affects of geographic factors, climatic factors and S, N deposition. Climatic factors (temperature sum and relative moisture) alone, and joint affects of climatic and S, N deposition accounted for 13 per cent and 12 per cent of the explained variation, respectively. The pure geographic factors and the pure deposition accounted for less than 5 per cent, respectively. This analysis suggests that the response of green algae to S and N deposition is mainly climate dependent, stronger in a warm and moist climate than in a cool and dry one.

TI  - Notes on research into new regional disparities in Austria
T2  - MITTEILUNGEN DER OSTERREICHISCHEN GEOGRAPHISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - In this short paper segments of a research focus of the Austrian Research Foundation on "Austria. Space and Society" are dealt with. It is argued that an interlinking of research approaches so far only taken separately may serve to put commonly accepted cliches right.
   It is shown that a simple centre-versus-periphery model postulating disadvantaged peripheral and advantaged central regions is not applicable to Austria: disadvantages as to work are counterbalanced by advantages as to housing, and vice versa.
   A novel combination of variables concerning the economic capacity of specific regions and others relating to a social transference of real estate prices allows a series of prognostications for future regional developments.
   A comparative study of the functions of agriculture, namely production and landscape conservation, on the one hand reveals a far-reaching emancipation from ecological conditions generally still considered pertinent and on the other hand shows the taking on of the integral task of landscape conservation on the part of the local residents and the communes in rural areas.
   The analysis of regional disparities is one of the most basic problems in a geography oriented towards practically applicable research findings. Therefore, the investigation of disparities remains topical as well as necessary. The indicators commonly used must, however, be critically revised and interlinked, on the basis of theoretical considerations, with new regional indicators found by means of primary research.

AB  - Turbidity is an important indicator of riverine conditions, especially in a fragile environment such as the Tibetan Plateau. Remote sensing, with the advantages of large-scale observations, has been widely applied to monitor turbidity change in lakes and rivers; however, few studies have focused on turbidity change of rivers on the Tibetan Plateau. We investigated the pattern of turbidity change in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, southern Tibetan Plateau, based on multispectral satellite imagery and in situ measurements. We developed empirical models from in situ measured water leaving reflectance and turbidity, and applied the best performed s-curve models on satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Landsat 5 to derive turbidity change in 2007-2017. Our results revealed an overall decreasing spatial trend from the upper to lower streams. Seasonal variations were observed with high turbidity from July to September and low turbidity from October to May. Annual turbidity showed a temporally slightly declining trend from 2007 to 2017. The pattern of turbidity change is affected by the confluence of tributaries and the changes in precipitation and vegetation along the river. These findings provide important insights into the responses of riverine turbidity to climate and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Durum wheat is an important food source in Mediterranean countries, and Italy is the major producer of durum wheat in Europe. The quality of durum wheat flours depends on the type and amount of gluten proteins and starch while flour nutritional value rests on metabolite contents such as polyphenols. In this work, two Italian cultivars, Iride and Svevo, were analyzed for two years (2016-2017) in four Italian regions to explore how the environment affects: (i) reserve proteome; (ii) starch content and composition; and (iii) free, conjugated, bound phenolics and antioxidant capacity. The impact of environmental and meteorological conditions was significant for many traits. Regardless of the cultivation site, in 2017, a year with less rainfall and a higher temperature during grain filling, there was an increase in low molecular weight glutenins, in the glutenin/gliadin ratio and in the A-type starch granules size, all parameters of higher technological quality. In the same year, the cultivars showed higher amounts of polyphenols and antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, the two wheat cultivars, selected for their medium to high yield and their good quality, had higher performances in 2017 regardless of their sowing locations.

AB  - Energy conservation is regarded as one of the most important factors in the agricultural sector due to its relation to pollution which is a result of fossil fuel (particularly gasoline) usage. The objective of this research was to develop three methods including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), regression and Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to predict the effect of soil properties on the environmental indicators in land levelling and to analyse the sensitivity of these parameters. The acquired data were used to develop accurate models for fuel energy (FE), total machinery cost (TMC) and total machinery energy (TME). The results showed that four parameters of tillage depth, forward speed, cone index and cut/fill volume had significant effects on energy consumption. ANFIS and ANN had a satisfactory performance in predicting the aforementioned parameters in the various field conditions. The ANN had the most capability in FE prediction according to the least RMSE and the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) values 0.0206 and 0.9983, respectively. The ANFIS model had the most capability in the prediction of the environmental and energy parameters with the least RMSE and the highest R-2 for TMC, 0.0287 and 0.9966, and for TME, 0.0157 and 0.9990, respectively.

AB  - In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) initiated a re-evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavoring ingredients. This publication is the first in a series and summarizes the evaluation of 54 Citrus-derived NFCs using the procedure outlined in Smith et al. (2005) and updated in Cohen et al. (2018) to evaluate the safety of naturally-occurring mixtures for their intended use as flavoring ingredients. The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of each NFC intended for commerce and organization of each NFC's chemical constituents into well-defined congeneric groups. The safety of the NFC is evaluated using the well-established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept in addition to data on absorption, metabolism and toxicology of members of the congeneric groups and the NFC under evaluation. As a result of the application of the procedure, 54 natural flavor complexes derived from botanicals of the Citrus genus were affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under their conditions of intended use as flavoring ingredients based on an evaluation of each NFC and the constituents and congeneric groups therein.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution in urban areas of India is very severe and complex. This study has been conducted to assess the health risk of inhabitants by heavy metals (Cd, Mn, Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, and Cr) through the groundwater intake of Mathura city of Uttar Pradesh, India. A total of 65 groundwater samples were collected, and these samples were analyzed for the presence of heavy metals (Cd, Mn, Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, and Cr). The total concentration of heavy metals present in groundwater was in the order of Ni > Fe > Pb > Cr > Cd > Zn > Mn > Cu Sediment quality indicator such as heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and geo- accumulation index (I-geo) were also evaluated in addition to multivariate statistical techniques, such as Pearson correlation matrix. The HPI mean value has been found to be 66.61 indicating the groundwater quality is in poor condition. The I geo results confirm the certain extent of heavy metals contamination in the groundwater of Mathura city with respect to Pb, Cd, Ni, Fe, and Cr. The correlation matrix of the heavy metals in the groundwater has also been evaluated. No significant correlations have been observed among most of these heavy metals, indicating different anthropogenic and natural sources of contamination.

AB  - A substantial amount of petroleum was recently discovered in the Carboniferous volcanic reservoir of the Chepaizi Uplift in the western Junggar Basin, yet the source is still indefinitive. Geochemical investigation indicates that the Carboniferous oils from the eastern and western Chepaizi Uplift are characterized by different source facies, although they are all typically of lacustrine origin. The eastern oils exhibit a restricted, clastic starved, highly reducing hypersaline condition during source rock deposition, which is distinct from the western oils. The Carboniferous oils were subjected to biodegradation ranging from rank 6 to rank 9, as indicated by the presence of 25-norhopane, evident depletion of hopanes and regular steranes, and even selective reduction of tricyclic terpanes. The maturities for the Carboniferous oils correspond to the onset of oil generation. The eastern oils contain lower (C-19 + C-20)TT/(C-23 + C-24)TT and C19TT/C21TT, and lighter stable carbon isotopes than the western ones, correlating well with the Middle Permian Wuerhe (P(2)w) source rocks and the Jurassic source rocks, respectively. The good correlation of tricyclic terpanes source-related parameters further implies less contribution to the eastern oils by the Carboniferous source rocks.

AB  - Audience response is an important indicator of the quality of performing arts. Psychophysiological measurements enable researchers to perceive and understand audience response by collecting their bio-signals during a live performance. However, how the audience respond and how the performance is affected by these responses are the key elements but are hard to implement. To address this issue, we designed a brain-computer interactive system called Brain-Adaptive Digital Performance (BADP) for the measurement and analysis of audience engagement level through an interactive three-dimensional virtual theater. The BADP system monitors audience engagement in real time using electroencephalography (EEG) measurement and tries to improve it by applying content-related performing cues when the engagement level decreased.
   In this article, we generate EEG-based engagement level and build thresholds to determine the decrease and re-engage moments. In the experiment, we simulated two types of theatre performance to provide participants a high-fidelity virtual environment using the BADP system. We also create content-related performing cues for each performance under three different conditions. The results of these evaluations show that our algorithm could accurately detect the engagement status and the performing cues have a positive impact on regaining audience engagement across different performance types. Our findings open new perspectives in audience-based theatre performance design.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to investigate the kinetics and the mechanism of reaction of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial danofloxacin (DANO) by free available chlorine (FAC) during water chlorination process. Kinetic study was thus performed at pH 7.2, 20 degrees C in the presence of an excess of total chlorine. Under these experimental conditions, a second-order reaction rate constant (first-order relative to DANO concentration and first-order relative to FAC concentration) was evaluated to k similar to 1446 M-1 s(-1). Five degradation products were identified at different reaction times. Their structures were investigated by using fragmentations obtained at different CID collision energies in MS/MS experiments. Moreover, the toxicity of the proposed structures was predicted by using T.E.S.T. program. The results indicated that all by-products may have a developmental toxicity. The oral rat LD50 concentration was predicted to be lower than that of DANO. Furthermore, two degradation compounds presented a concentration level for fathead minnow LC50 (96 h) lower than that of DANO and presented toxicity for the marine animals.

AB  - Precisely monitoring land cover/use is crucial for urban environmental assessment and management. Various classification techniques such as pixel-based and object-based approaches have advantages and disadvantages. In this article, based on our experiment data from an unmanned platform carried lidar scanner system and camera, we explored and compared classification accuracies of pixel-based decision tree (DT) and object-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) approaches. Lidar height information can improve classification accuracy based on either object-based SVM or pixel-based DT. From total classification accuracy, object-based SVM was higher than that of pixel-based DT classification, and total accuracy and kappa coefficient of the former were 92.71% and 0.899, respectively. However, pixel-based DT outperformed object-based SVM when classifying small 'scatter' tree along roads. Additionally, in order to evaluate the accuracy of pixel-based DT and object-based SVM, we added benchmark data of ISPRS to compare the classification results of two methods. Object-based SVM classification methods by combining aerial imagery with lidar height information can achieve higher classification accuracy. And, accurately extracting tree class of different landscape pattern should select appropriate machine-learning algorithms. Comparison of the results on two methods will provide a reference for selecting a particular classification approaches according to local conditions.

AB  - Micafish porphyroclasts are common and excellent shear-sense indicators in mylonites. Although their geometries are well characterized by recent studies, they are still poorly understood. Here we simulate the behavior in mylonites of micafish by regarding them as anisotropic power-law ellipsoidal inhomogeneities embedded in a power-law viscous material subjected to general plane-straining non-coaxial flows. We apply the Eshelby's solutions extended for general non-Newtonian power-law materials. The anisotropy of mica is defined by two different shear viscosities: a weak shear viscosity associated with slip on cleavage and a strong shear viscosity without activating the cleavage slip. Our modeling reproduces naturally observed geometries of micafish. Natural micafish geometries require that the weak shear viscosity of mica must be lower and the strong shear viscosity must be greater than the matrix viscosity. We demonstrate that regardless of the initial condition of micafish, the shape long axis and the cleavage trace observed on the vorticity-normal section will most commonly end up at a small antithetic angle relative to the shear plane or parallel to it. Our modeling results are consistent with the mica rheological properties determined by rock deformation experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Naproxen-C14H14O3 is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug which has been found at detectable concentrations in wastewater, surface water, and groundwater. Naproxen is relatively hydrophilic and is in anionic form at pH between 6 and 8. In this study, column experiments were performed using an unconsolidated aquifer material from an area near Barcelona (Spain) to assess transport and reaction mechanisms of Naproxen in the aquifer matrix under different pore water fluxes. Results were evaluated using HYDRUS-1D, which was used to estimate transport parameters. Batch sorption isotherms for Naproxen conformed with the linear model with a sorption coefficient of 0.42 (cm(3) g(-1)), suggesting a low sorption affinity. Naproxen breakthrough curves (BTCs) measured in soil columns under steady-state, saturated water flow conditions displayed similar behavior, with no apparent hysteresis in sorption or dependence of retardation (R, 3.85-4.24) on pore water velocities. Soil sorption did not show any significant decrease for increasing flow rates, as observed from Naproxen recovery in the effluent. Sorption parameters estimated by the model suggest that Naproxen has a low sorption affinity to aquifer matrix. Most sorption of Naproxen occurred on the instantaneous sorption sites, with the kinetic sorption sites representing only about 10 to 40% of total sorption.

AB  - Domiasiat (25A degrees 30'N 91A degrees 30'E) located in the west Khasi hill district of Meghalaya in northeast India is one of the largest sandstone-type uranium (U) ore deposit in India containing 9.22 million tonnes of ore reserves with an average ore grade of around 0.1 % U3O8. This geographically distinct U deposit of Domiasiat is un-mined and harbours diverse group of bacteria surviving the stressful environmental conditions prevalent in the ore deposit. Studies show that the diverse bacteria belonged to 10 different bacterial groups with occurrence of some previously uncharacterized bacteria. The cultured identified bacteria have been reported to tolerate substantial concentration of U and other metals and showed potent capacity for uptake and precipitation of U. Studying the bacterial community associated with such pre-mined U ore deposit are advantageous as it not only generates the baseline information on microbial community structure as resourceful indicator to estimate the impact of mining to be undertaken in future but also identifies the bacteria which can be explored for their potential as bioremediation agents for radionuclide/multi-metal waste sites.

AB  - Hydraulic stimulation technologies are widely applied across resource and power generation industries to increase the productivity of oil/gas or hot water reservoirs. These technologies utilise pressurised water, which is applied inside the well to initiate and drive fractures as well as to open a network of existing natural fractures. To prevent the opened fractures from complete closure during production stage, small particles (proppants) are normally injected with the pressurised fluid. These particles are subjected to confining stresses when the fluid pressure is removed, which leads to a partial closure of the stimulated fractures. The residual fracture openings are the main outcome of such hydraulic stimulations as these openings significantly affect the permeability of the reservoirs and, subsequently, the well productivity. Past research was largely focused on the assessment of conditions and characteristics of fluid driven fractures as well as proppant placement techniques. Surprisingly, not much work was devoted to the assessment of the residual fracture profiles. In this work we develop a simplified non-linear mathematical model of residual closure of a plane crack filled with deformable particles and subjected to a remote compressive stress. It is demonstrated that the closure profile is significantly influenced by the distribution and compressibility of the particles, which are often ignored in the current evaluations of well productivity.

AB  - There are many incidents of increasing fluoride concentrations observed in India's groundwater. In the present study, the fluoride content was chemically analysed and integrated with geochemical model WATEQ4F sampled from Allahabad district, Northern India, with other water quality parameters. Geospatial technique was employed to depict the spatial distribution of fluoride concentrations, over this plain, normalized with WHO (World Health Organization) and BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) standards represented in the form of spatially interpolated maps. Hydro-geological conditions, such as weathering, geochemical reactions, alkaline nature of water, ion-exchange and high variability in temperature range, were taken into account in describing the geo or anthropogenic contributions to fluoride in groundwater. A large database of available ancillary information on related factors, such as soil properties, geological settings and climatic and topographical information, on a local scale, were also taken into account to rationalize the results. The analysis implies that post-monsoon samples have elevated concentration of fluoride compared with the pre-monsoon samples, with several zones found severely contaminated with fluoride as compared with the set standards in both seasons. The correlation analysis revealed a high correlation of fluoride, with fluorite mineral saturation index, followed by calcite and magnesite, indicating that these minerals could be used as geochemical indicators for fluoride contaminated areas.

AB  - We analysed proline, abscisic acid, (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), indole acetic acid (IAA) and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation after summer drought at two Pinus pinaster provenance-progeny trial sites. The aim of the study was to evaluate P. pinaster phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variation in the endogenous concentrations of these metabolites and to determine the best stress indicators for family and population discrimination. The environmental effect was remarkable, as striking differences between the sites were obtained for all indicators except for SA, which was unaffected by the environmental conditions. The levels of proline, ABA and IAA were higher in the xeric than in the mesic site. In contrast, JA was higher in the mesic site. The higher variation displayed at the family level led to family differences for all parameters and sites. Differences in proline and ABA between populations were exclusively found in the xeric site, where the population from the wet climate showed higher accumulation. This study provides evidence for differentiation among P. pinaster populations and families in their plastic responses to drought and highlights the importance of considering intraspecific variability when evaluating biochemical stress indicators in environmental studies.

AB  - Humans interact with their environment through the five senses, but little is known about population variability in the ability to assess contaminants. Sensory thresholds and biochemical indicators of metallic flavor perception in humans were evaluated for ferrous (Fe2+) iron in drinking water; subjects aged 19-84 years participated. Metallic flavor thresholds for individuals and subpopulations based on age were determined. Oral lipid oxidation and oral pH were measured in saliva as potential biochemical indicators. Individual thresholds were 0.007-14.14 mg/L Fe2+ and the overall population threshold was 0.17 mg/L Fe2+ in reagent water. Average thresholds for individuals younger and older than Si) years of age (grouped by the daily recommended nutritional guidelines for iron intake) were significantly different (p = 0.013); the population thresholds for each group were 0.045 mg/L Fe2+ and 0.498 mg/L Fez, respectively. Many subjects >50 and a few subjects <50 years were insensitive to metallic flavor. There was no correlation between age, oral lipid oxidation, and oral pH. Standardized olfactory assessment found poor sensitivity for Fe2+ corresponded with conditions of mild, moderate, and total anosmia. The findings demonstrate an age-dependent sensitivity to iron indicating as people age they are less sensitive to metallic perception.

AB  - The process of producing cement products from solid waste can increase the level of pollutants in the cement products. Therefore, it is very important to establish a pollution control standard for cement products to protect the environment and human health. This paper presents acceptance limits for the availability of heavy metals in cement products which have been produced from solid wastes and explains how the limits have been calculated. The approach and method used to formulate these criteria were based on EN 12920. The typical exposure scenarios used in this paper involve concrete being used for drinking water supply pipelines and concrete pavements and are based on an analysis of typical applications of cement in China, and the potential for contact with water. The parameters of a tank test which was based on NEN 7375 were set in accordance with the environmental conditions of typical scenarios in China. Mechanisms controlling the release of heavy metals in concrete and a model for that release were obtained using the leaching test. Finally, based on acceptance criteria for drinking water and groundwater quality in China, limit values for the availability of heavy metals in concrete were calculated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Automation ill Outdoor applications (farming, Surveillance, military activities, etc.) requires highly accurate control of mobile robots, at high speed, although they are moving on low-grip terrain. To meet such expectations, advanced control laws accounting for natural ground specificities (mainly sliding effects) must be derived. In previous work, adaptive and predictive control algorithms, based on an extended kinematic representation, have been proposed. Satisfactory experimental results have been reported (accurate to within +/- 10 cm,, whatever the grip conditions), but at limited velocity (below 3 m.s(-1)). Nevertheless, simulations reveal that control accuracy is decreased when vehicle speed is increased (up to 10 m.S-1). In particular, oscillations are observed at curvature transition. This drawback is due to delays in sideslip angle estimation, unavoidable at high speed because only an extended kinematic representation was used. hi this paper, a mixed backstepping kinematic and dynamic observer is designed to improve observation of these variables: the slow-varying data are still estimated from a kinematic representation, which is then injected into a dynamic observer to supply reactive and reliable sliding variable (namely sideslip angle) estimation, without increasing the noise level. The algorithm is evaluated via advanced Simulations (coupling Adams and MatLab software) investigating highspeed capabilities. Actual experiments at lower speed (experimental platform maximum velocity) demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Suckler cow farmers are challenged both by the evolution of their socio-economic environment and by weather and market risks. This study was aimed at testing if farms characterised a priori by a higher flexibility are less sensitive to weather and beef price risks without experiencing lower average income.
   Technical and economic variables were extracted from a panel dataset of 55 farms from the French Charolais area over the period 1987-2007. Three production profiles were defined according to stocking rate and male fattening rate criteria. Longer production cycles are supposed to provide a higher diversity of animal in a short run and lower stocking rate. To face weather variability, adjustments concerned mainly animal supplementation and haymaking and were used above all by the farmers with the highest stocking rate. These farmers then experienced higher income variability in response to weather conditions. The farmers fattening the most were less sensitive to price variations. Average income was not significantly different according to profiles. Regarding farm evolution, we observed an increase of farm size, an intensification of animal production and a decrease of male fattening. The farms with the lowest stocking rate tended to decrease even more their forage management.

AB  - Ontario's hardwood forests are currently subjected to high levels of air pollution, but critical levels at which point adverse effects may occur are poorly known. In this study, we sampled 35 hardwood plots dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) located along a contrasting climate, soil acidity, and air pollution gradient in southern Ontario to explore relationships between these potential ecosystem stressors and ecosystem responses. Foliar sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) contents were positively correlated with modeled deposition, and foliose lichen species richness was negatively correlated with modeled air pollution levels (S deposition, N deposition, and atmospheric ozone AOT40), whereas foliar calcium, magnesium, and manganese contents were correlated with A-horizon soil acidity. Forest floor S and N contents and C/N ratios were related to soil pH, with high S and N contents and low C/N ratios occurring on the more acidic soil in the northern part of the region, which receives the lowest modeled loadings of S and N deposition and experience colder and wetter climate. Forest health as determined by canopy condition was not related to indices of air pollution, climate, or soil acidity, and no relationship was found among air pollution, soil acidity, and ground vegetation species richness or diversity.

AB  - The effects of heavy metal contamination on soil enzyme activity and earthworm health (bioaccumulation and condition) were studied in contaminated soils collected from an formerly open burning and open detonation (OBOD) site. Soil extraction methods were also evaluated using CaCl2 and DTPA solutions as surrogate measures of metal bioavailability and ecotoxicity. Total heavy metal content of the soils ranged from 0.45 to 9.68 mg Cd kg(-1), 8.96 to 5103 mg Cu kg(-1), 40.21 to 328 mg Pb kg(-1), and 56.61 to 10,890 mg Zn kg(-1). Elevated metal concentrations are assumed to be primarily responsible for the reduction in enzyme activities and earthworm health indices. We found significant negative relationships between CaCl2- and DTPA-extractable metal content (Cd, Cu, and Zn) and soil enzyme activity (P< 0.01). Therefore, it could be concluded that soil enzyme activity and metal bioaccumulation by earthworms can be used as an ecological indicator of metal availability. Furthermore, CaCl2 and DTPA extraction methods are proved as promising, precise, and inexpensive surrogate measures of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn bioavailability from heavy metal-contaminated soils.

AB  - There is strong evidence of continuously increasing contamination of soils with platinum group elements (PGE), in particular with platinum (Pt) from vehicle exhaust catalysts in roadside soils. However, knowledge about the effects of Pt contamination on soil processes is very limited. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the contamination of soils with Pt at realistic environmental levels leads to observable adverse effects on selected indicator parameters of the carbon and nitrogen turnover in soils. Incubation experiments with artificially contaminated soils and solutions containing dissolved organic matter (DOM) were carried out by the use of milled material from a Pt-containing vehicle exhaust catalyst. Interaction of the catalyst material with the soil resulted in a mobilization of Pt into the dissolved phase reaching up to 0.1% of the added Pt. The amount of Pt mobilization seemed to be mainly driven by the pH of the soil. Mineralization of carbon and nitrogen did not reveal any significant adverse effect of the Pt addition as compared to the control samples. Future studies dealing with Pt effects on soil processes should focus on environmental conditions favoring Pt mobilization, e.g. such as very low pH values or large concentrations of DOM.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the soil seed bank under secondary vegetation in an area degraded by kaolin mining in Bras Pires, MG, Brazil. Forty soil samples of 0.5 x 0.5 m were collected to the depth of 5.0 cm. The soil samples were maintained in nursery for four months, half in shading of 11.5% (light), and half in shading of 60% (shade). Seed germination was compared under the two shade conditions (11.5% and 60%), utilizing the t test for independent samples. Thirty-six species belonging to 17 botanical families were sampled. The families with the largest number of species were Asteraceae with 9, Rubiaceae with 5, and Poaceae with 4. Most of the species sampled (66.7%) were herbaceous. The most abundant species were the herbaceous Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R. D. Webster, Cenchrus sp. and Eragrostis sp., and the shrub Leandra niangaeformis Cogn. Among the tree species, Luehea grandiflora Mart. and Trema micranta (L.) Blume presented the largest number of individuals. The largest density of the herbs originating from the disturbed surrounding areas indicates a low resilience of the vegetation in the degraded area, in case a severe disturbance occurs.

AB  - Sustainability has become a key concern for consumers and industry. However, coming to understand its implications in the context of daily life can be difficult. It may be hard to come to terms with the idea that traditional activities present environmental risks and may lead to real emergencies, manifested differently depending on local conditions. Everyone will be asked to do more but the move towards sustainability may require the total transformation of current attitudes and actions. This paper considers the role of informatics in responding to, and possibly averting,, environmental emergencies by making information available to decision makers, whether they are individual consumers, institutional buyers, or emergency response personnel. If all choices can be presented within a spectrum of best and worst possible impacts for sustainability, decision makers can meaningfully weigh their options. Any evaluation on this basis is presently very difficult because one needs to independently assess and integrate possibly incomplete and conflicting information from a wide variety of sources. This paper describes the use of the cogito software, which embodies an approach for data access and presentation that is expected to provide significant benefits over existing web-based tools. The paper also considers the issues related to the collection and synthesis of disparate data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does the explanatory constraint on practical reasons favour naturalism about practical reasons?
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
CP  - 32nd Annual Conference of the Philosophical-Society-of-Southern-Africa
AB  - There is an explanatory constraint on practical reasons: practical reasons have to be the kinds of things that we can act for. Some philosophers, notably Bernard Williams, have argued that the explanatory constraint favours internalism about reasons: for all agent to have a reason to (1) it is at least a necessary condition that she would, after ideal deliberation, be motivated to phi. Internalisin Suggests that naturalism about reasons is more plausible for, in this view, reasons are psychological states. However, reasons Must not only be the kinds of things we call act for, at least some reasons must be good reasons, i.e. normative requirements. Derek Parfit argues that internalist, naturalist accounts cannot Capture the normative aspect of reasons. He takes this to be a point in favour of his own externalist, non-naturalist account. I ask first whether Williams' account does fail to account for the normativity of reasons its Parfit argues, and second whether Parfit's externalist account can adequately meet the explanatory constraint. Although I claim that the answer to the first question is yes and the second no, the answer to both questions turns oil the nature of practical rationality. My case stands practical rationality is procedural, and falls if practical rationality is substantive. I argue, however, that the burden of proof is on those who, like Parfit, wish to defend a Substantive account of practical rationality.

AB  - Determination of knock onset for any engine tuning remains a difficult work for many engine manufacturers. This study investigates different combinations of existing knock indices in order to produce an upgraded indicator, which is easier to calibrate. Experiments are conducted on a single-cylinder gas engine bounded to combined heat and power (CHP). Effects of spark advance, volumetric efficiency and equivalent ratio are studied under constant speed operation. The ratio IMPO/(MAPO x W) (with IMPO defined as the Integral of Modulus of Pressure Oscillations, MAPO as the Maximum Amplitude of Pressure Oscillations and W as the width of the computational window) is proposed as suitable indice. In any engine setting, it remains constant under no knocking conditions. When knock occurs, a model deduced from dimensionless analysis allows determination of the oversteps of Knock Limited Spark Advance from a single IMPO/(MAPO x W) measurement with an accuracy better than 1 CA. Knock is then studied for different gas qualities by adding propane or carbon dioxide to the fuel. The results show that there is no significant effect of the fuel composition on the proposed indicator, making the model able to calculate KLSA overstep in all the situations.

AB  - A GIS-aided simulation (GISSIM) system is developed for effective management of petroleum-contaminated sites in this study. The GISSIM contains two components: an advanced three-dimensional (3D) numerical model, and a geographical information system (GIS). The modeling component undertakes simulation for the fate of contaminants in subsurface unsaturated and saturated zones. The GIS component is used in three areas throughout the system development and implementation process: (1) managing spatial and nonspatial databases, (2) linking inputs, the model, and outputs; and (3) providing an interface between the GISSIM and its users. The system is applied to a North American case study. Concentrations of benzene, toluene, and xylenes in groundwater under a petroleum-contaminated site are dynamically simulated. Conditions of the contamination in different time stages under a variety of remediation scenarios are predicted. Reasonable outputs have been obtained and presented graphically. Implications of the modeling outputs have been analyzed based on the local environmental regulations. They provide quantitative and scientific bases for further assessment of site-contamination impacts and risks, as well as decisions of practical remediation actions. GISSIM is useful for both industrial and government sectors to make informed decisions on waste management, pollution control, site remediation, and environmental impact assessment.

AB  - The Late Pliocene (younger than 2.5 Ma) alluvial fan succession of Toppetti Quarry, near Todi, Umbria, Central Italy, includes many palaeosols. Pedogenic carbonate concretions and mollusc remains were separated from 73 palaeosols collected along 150 m of exposure and analysed for their oxygen and carbon stable isotope content. delta C-13 and delta O-18 of the pedogenic carbonate and land snail shells suggest that no dramatic change in local climate took place. Values of the pedogenic carbonates are similar to other data reported for the Mediterranean region. delta O-18 data suggest a mean annual temperature and/or delta O-18 similar to modern climatic conditions. Carbon isotope data from both land snails and pedogenic carbonate are consistent with a prevailing type C-3 vegetation. A mixture of forest and C-3 grassland, sustained by a mean annual precipitation between 300 and 1000 mn, mainly in the cool periods of the year, seems to be the most likely scenario. The limited variation shown by the isotope composition of the biogenic and inorganically precipitated carbonate indicates that the environmental variations are referable mainly to change of humidity rather than temperature.

TI  - MICRO-PURGE LOW-FLOW SAMPLING OF URANIUM-CONTAMINATED GROUND-WATER AT THE FERNALD ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT PROJECT
T2  - GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION
LA  - English
AB  - Efforts to sample representative, undisturbed distributions of uranium in ground water beneath the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) prompted the application of a novel technique that is less invasive in the monitoring well. Recent studies (Kearl et al. 1992; Barcelona et al. 1994) indicate that representative samples can and should be collected without prior well volume exchange purging or borehole evacuation. Field experiments conducted at the FEMP demonstrate that under specific sampling conditions in a well-defined hydrogeologic system, representative ground water samples for a monitoring program can be obtained without removing the conventional three well volumes from the well. The assumption is made that indicator parameter equilibration may not be necessary to determine when to collect representative samples at the FEMP. Preliminary results obtained from the field experiments suggest that this may be true. The technique employs low purge rates (< 1 L/min) with dedicated bladder pumps with inlets located in the screened interval of the well, while not disturbing the stagnant water column above the screened interval. If adopted, this technique, termed micro-purge low-flow sampling, will produce representative ground water samples, significantly reduce sampling costs, and minimize waste water over the monitoring life cycle at the FEMP. This technique is well suited for sites that have been fully characterized and are undergoing long-term monitoring.

AB  - The concentrations of 14 major and trace elements (B, Ba, Be, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, P, S, V, Zn and organic C) in bulk sediment samples of Holocene age from bore holes in the Nile delta, Egypt, are considered in terms of sediment grain size and depositional setting. Using this background information, an attempt is made to evaluate paleosalinity and paleoclimatic change by geochemical analyses of peats. In every sediment facies examined, we find that grain size is a major controlling factor of geochemical composition, but the B/Be ratio is helpful in paleoenvironmental interpretations.
   Organic-matter content is the major factor affecting element concentrations in peats. Zn, Cr, Fe, Be, Cu, Mn concentrations on an organic-matter-free basis are lower in these organic-rich layers than in other Nile delta sediment facies. The sulfur content of the peats indicates a decreased importance of freshwater input to Holocene lagoons from about 8000 to 3400 years BP. High boron/beryllium ratios and the presence of gypsum in peats deposited between 6300 and 4900 years BP record the most evaporitic phase affecting this region. This geochemical finding is in close agreement with results of other independent paleoclimatic studies which indicate the onset of arid conditions in northeast Africa at about 5000 years BP.

AB  - Increasing evidences have showed that a tight link among pathogen infection, physiological indicators and intestinal microbiota. To investigate effects of Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) infection to growth retardation and intestinal microbiota, different sized Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) infecting with EHP were studied. The shrimp with big, medium and small sized groups were from same batch of postlarvae and reared in one pond under the same diet and environmental conditions. Number of EHP copies revealed that the more EHP copies the smaller size of shrimp individuals. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles showed intestinal bacterial patterns of small sized shrimp were similar to the middle sized shrimp, rather than the big sized shrimp. It implied that intestinal microbiota were influenced by severity of EHP infection and suggested the different sizes of shrimp were due to the successive infection period of EHP. Among the different sized groups, the relative abundance of Vibrio of small group was the highest, suggesting EHP infection could result in higher susceptibility to pathogen invasion. Our findings provided the evidence intestinal bacterial patterns altered by infection of EHP, the more EHP copies the smaller size of shrimp, and different sized individuals due to successive infection period of EHP.

AB  - Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by the necrotroph Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Lib. (de Bary), is a major disease of canola in Australia, greatly reducing yields in high infection years. This study investigated genotype by environment by management interactions at 25 sites across the south-west Australian grainbelt from 2017 to 2020. Up to 10 canola varieties were grown each year with +/- fungicide application at 30% flowering. Disease incidence was low, with less than 20% infection recorded across most sites. Most variation in yield occurred between sites, rather than by management or variety, due to the environmental differences between the sites. Petal assays were found to be a poor indicator of later disease severity, suggesting the winter growing season in south-west Australia does not have reliable conducive conditions for disease development following petal drop in canola. The Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction model (AMMI) indicated that the open-pollinated varieties were broadly adapted and stable when fungicide was applied but became unstable with no fungicide, indicating SSR has a significant impact on yield when disease incidence is higher. This study highlights that further research is necessary to determine disease thresholds that lead to significant yield loss.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution represents a health threat. Many fungal species are capable of tolerating various heavy metals, especially if they are isolated from a contaminated watercourse. One of the mechanisms by which fungi can sequester certain heavy metals is synthesizing stress proteins. The aim of this study is to investigate the production of metallothioneins in Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus clavatus exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of Cd, Cu, Fe, and Zn at neutral, alkaline, and acidic pH conditions within 10 days. We determined the concentrations of these heavy metals in certain watercourses representing Behira and Giza governorates; also, we identified the most prevalent fungal species. We carried out a statistical correlation between different heavy metals and the isolated fungi. Then, in the laboratory, we exposed two of the most prevalent fungal species to the environmentally detected concentrations of the heavy metals and their doubles. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that in A. oryzae, the metallothionein bands appeared in neutral medium containing Cd and Cu and in alkaline medium containing Cd and Zn, while in A. clavatus, no metallothionein bands appeared at all. In conclusion, metallothionein is a good indicator of pollution with Cd, Cu, and Zn in Aspergillus oryzae, and pH plays a central role in metallothionein production.

AB  - Objective: Paranoid ideation is assumed to characterize worries about possible harmful effects of modern technologies (MHWs) and idiopathic environmental intolerances (IEIs), such as IEI attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF). Empirical evidence on these associations is scarce.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional on-line survey, participants of a community sample (n = 700; mean age: 28.4 +/- 12.0; 434 females) completed the Somatosensory Amplification Scale, the Modern Health Worries Scale, and the Paranoid Ideation scale of the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised. They were considered IEI-EMF if (1) they categorized themselves so, (2) they had experienced symptoms that they attributed to the exposure to electromagnetic fields, and (3) the condition impacted their everyday functioning.
   Results: Paranoid ideation was significantly positively associated with MHWs (standardized beta = 0.150, p < .001) even after controlling for socio-demographic variables and somatosensory amplification tendency, an indicator of somatic symptom distress. Also, paranoid ideation explained significant variability in IEI-EMF (OR = 1.090, 95% CI: 1.006-1.180, p = .035) even after statistically controlling for socio-demographic variables and somatosensory amplification. Conclusions: Paranoid ideation was found to be associated with MHWs and IEI-EMF. This association appears independent of general somatic symptom distress in both cases. This might partly explain the temporal stability of these constructs.

AB  - Spatio-temporal fluctuations in soil N2O emissions are well documented, but it is difficult to predict the location of 'hot spots' and the timing of 'hot moments' of N2O emissions from agroecosystems with dynamic, heterogeneous soil environments. Although the soil nitrite (NO2-) concentration is a potential indicator of soil N2O production, it is seldom measured. This perspective paper explains the emerging methods for NO(2)(-)quantification with ion-selective electrodes and infrared spectroscopy, and describes how these tools may be used to adjust nitrogen fertilization through site-specific management. We envision a new system for soil N2O mitigation that integrates knowledge from portable NO(2)(-)sensors, machine learning, and the internet of things to predict the 'hot spots' and 'hot moments' of N2O in agroecosystems. This integrated system will produce a real-time soil NO(2)(-)map that is validated by in situ soil NO(2)(-)sensors. The integrated system requires further development of ion-selective electrodes and spectrometric methods for real-time NO(2)(-)quantification under field conditions, as well as appropriate machine learning models and communication technologies. Our concept supports the adoption of site-specific nitrogen fertilizer management as a strategy to reduce soil N2O emissions from agroecosystems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the environmental risk of Balarood Dam in Iran at constructional phase. The scientific methods used in this research were the Environmental Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (EFMEA) and VIKOR. In the process of environmental risk assessment, the EFMEA method was used first to calculate the risk priority number (RPN) for each environmental aspect. The identified risks were ranked based on RPN values in the next stage. Comparison of the RPN values showed that the risk of pollution of Balarood River, with a RPN of 125, is in the first priority. In addition, the environmental risks, identified during the follow-up phase, were weighted by entropy method based on severity, occurrence probability, and extent of pollution.Then, the VIKOR method, as one of the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, was run to evaluate and prioritize the potential environmental risks. The risk of water pollution under high, medium and low conditions, with a weight of 1,300, 1,000 and 700, was identified as the most important risk of dam construction. Accordingly, the most important corrective action, proposed to mitigate the high priority environmental risks, is to prevent the discharge of sanitary and industrial wastewater into the river.

AB  - The trend of urban and suburban developments is concluding that more than 70% of the world population will be living in urban areas by mid-21st century within dis-comfortable built environment. In Egypt, a concern about climate change resilient communities is having more listeners after Paris climate agreement in 2015. Therefore, assessing present and future outdoor microclimatic effects on the indoor environmental quality and energy consumption in turn is crucial to build the capacities for mitigation and adaptation strategies. In this research work, the coupled outdoor-indoor simulation methodology is applied using ENVI-met and DesignBuilder to let buildings respond to the street canyon conditions since indoor simulation packages does not consider urban details. Such mutual relation is explored in a site case in Borg El-Arab, Alexandria, Egypt, in which urban canopy green coverage (trees, green walls and roofs) have been applied. Comparing results of indoor thermal comfort for the examined site buildings in present until end of century (2020, 2050 and 2080) with and without the urban canopy green coverage; show that indicators and adaptation strategies can be developed for climate change scenarios.

AB  - Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. wood was pyrolyzed using a semi-continuous gram-scale reactor at optimized conditions of temperature (469 degrees C), nitrogen flow rate (14.2 mL min(-1)), and particle size (1.3 mm), yielding bio-oil (54%), biochar (26%), and syngas (16%). The cost of bio-oil production for 1 t yr(-1) was estimated to be US$ 681.00. Financial analysis revealed a net present value (NPV)of US$ 24,322.00 at 12% discount rate, an IRR of 343.85 %, with breakeven quantity of 199 L. Sensitivity analysis showed that an increased price of raw materials up to 30 %, and a decreased price of products down to 25 %, resulted to an increased NPV and IRR. Decreasing the bio-oil yield below 40 % gave a negative NPV with an IRR of 9%. If bio-oil and biochar were tapped as alternative bioenergv, 360,000 L of fuel oil and 259 t of coal could be saved. A total greenhouse gas emission of 749 t of CO2 equivalent can be avoided. Thus, pigeon pea pyrolysis for bio-oil production provided a net positive energy output and was proven to be profitable investment, and environment-friendly as potential bioenergv resource to replace petroleum-based fuels.

AB  - Nutrition during pregnancy is one of the main conditions for the healthy fetal development, favorable course of pregnancy and its outcome. One of the ways for optimization of the nutritional status of pregnant and breastfeeding women is using specialized foods with the optimized chemical composition in a diet. The V. M. Gorbatov Federal Research Center for Food Systems of Russian Academy of Sciences (Gorbatov Research Center for Food Systems) developed the biologically active additives (BAAs) intended for the use in production of the specialized cooked sausages for nutrition of pregnant and breastfeeding women. With consideration for the requirements of the body in nutritional and biologically active substances and technological peculiarities of cooked sausage production, the composition of additives was substantiated, their medico-biological assessment was carried out and the parameters of their addition were established. The BAAs correspond to the established norms by the sanitary-chemical indicators, which will ensure safety of an enriched meat product. Using the developed BAAs, the biologically full-value sausages were produced, which correspond to the medico-biological requirements specified for this consumer group. Addition of the BAAs into a meat product in the recommended dose ensures meeting the daily requirement for biologically active substances (vitamins and calcium) by 15-28%, recommended ratio of omega-6:omega-3 fatty acids (5:1) and the calcium: phosphorus ratio (1:1.5).

AB  - Although the literature on social innovation has focused primarily on social enterprises, social innovation has long occurred within mainstream corporations. Drawing upon recent scholarship on social movements and institutional complexity, we analyze how movements foster corporate social innovation (CSI). Our context is the adoption of green information systems ("green IS"), which are information systems employed to transform organizations and society into more sustainable entities. We trace the historical emergence of green IS as a corporate response to increasing demands for sustainability reporting, a key social innovation that environmental activists helped to create. Drawing upon extensive survey data from more than 400 U.S. firms, we then examine how managers perceived environmental activism in relation to broader field pressures for change and how their perceptions of both were related to green IS adoption. The results reveal that activists were more effective at influencing adoption indirectly by transforming organizational fields than by directly influencing corporate managers. Combined with the historical analysis, these findings suggest that CSI emerged out of ongoing interactions between activists, corporate managers, and other influential actors within a broader social innovation system. Activists helped to create conditions for social innovation, but corporations took the lead in developing new practices.

AB  - We present a mathematical formulation of a multiscale model for solidification with convective flow in the liquid phase. The model is an extension of the dendritic needle network approach for crystal growth in a binary alloy. We propose a simple numerical implementation based on finite differences and step-wise approximations of parabolic dendritic branches of arbitrary orientation. Results of the two-dimensional model are verified against reference benchmark solutions for steady, unsteady, and buoyant flow, as well as steady-state dendritic growth in the diffusive regime. Simulations of equiaxed growth under forced flow yield dendrite tip velocities within 10% of quantitative phase-field results from the literature. Finally, we perform illustrative simulations of polycrystalline solidification using physical parameters for an aluminum-10wt%copper alloy. Resulting microstructures show notable differences when taking into account natural buoyancy in comparison to a purely diffusive transport regime. The resulting model opens new avenues for computationally and quantitatively investigating the influence of fluid flow and gravity-induced buoyancy upon the selection of dendritic microstructures. Further ongoing developments include an equivalent formulation for directional solidification conditions and the implementation of the model in three dimensions, which is critical for quantitative comparison to experimental measurements.

AB  - Metformin has been treated for diabetes (type 2). Nowadays, this compound is frequently found in ambient water, influent/effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. To evaluate the metformin aquatic toxicity under a multi-generational exposure regimen, we exposed Oryzias latipes to metformin for two generations (133 d) and investigated its adverse effects. In the F0 generation, metformin significantly elevated gene expression for cytochrome P450 19a (CYP19a) and estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) in male fish; in female fish, the treatment decreased gene expression of vitellogenin (VTG2) and ER beta 1, suggesting endocrine disruption (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Intersex occurrence of F0 female fish were found in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas no significant changes in fecundity and hatching rate were observed (p < 0.05). Metformin increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, and decreased the glutathione (GSH) content in F0 male fish compared with those of the control (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). In F0 female fish, metformin increased catalase activity compared with that of the control (p > 0.05). The results demonstrated that metformin leads to oxidative stress and two-generation endocrine disruption in O. latipes. These results may be useful for better understanding metformin toxicity mechanism.

AB  - Bacteriocins are peptides produced by various species of bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which have a large spectrum of action against spoilage bacteria and foodborne pathogens. However, when not entirely characterized, they are alternatively called bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 43200 grew and produced BLIS optimally when cultivated anaerobically in bioreactor for 24h at 30 degrees C and 200rpm in De Man, Rogosa and Sharp (MRS) medium supplemented with 1.5% peptone. Under such optimal conditions, the cell mass concentration (3.41g/L) was 66% higher, the generation time (1.28h) 38% shorter and the BLIS activity against different indicator strains significantly higher than in MRS medium without any supplement taken as a control, and the exponential phase started 4h before. The agar diffusion method showed BLIS inhibition halos against LAB strains with diameter in the range 11.0-19.5mm and specific areas between 377.1 and 2654.6mm(2)/mL, while BLIS activity against Listeria strains was better quantified by the liquid medium assay that showed, for the fermented broth without any dilution, 100 and 50% inhibition of Listeria innocua and Listeria seeligeri growth, respectively. These results highlight the potential of P. pentosaceus BLIS as a natural antimicrobial for application in the food industry.

AB  - This study proposes a comprehensive approach to investigate water resource contamination by pesticides under the specific climatic and hydrological conditions of the Sudano-Sahelian climate. Samples were collected from traditional wells, boreholes, and a lake in Burkina Faso. A multiresidue analysis was developed for 25 pesticides identified during field surveys. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were used to confirm trends observed with grab samples. Uptake kinetics of POCIS were assessed by in situ calibration. The proposed use of nonlinear least squares regression proved to be a robust approach for estimating time-weighted average concentration in cases of nonlinear uptake. High sampling rates for triazines in a quasi-stagnant lake were attributed to warm water temperatures (30.8 +/- 1.3 A degrees C). The combination of sampling techniques during a 3-year monitoring period allowed for identifying potential interactions between resources, seasonal patterns, and origins of contaminants. Atrazine, azadirachtin, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, dieldrin, imidacloprid, and profenofos exceeded 0.1 mu g L-1, indicating a potential risk for the consumers. Ecological risk assessment was performed using the Pesticide Tool Index for fish, cladocerans, and benthic invertebrates. Peak concentrations of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos were systematically associated with hazard to the studied taxa.

AB  - The present work deals with an optimization model for selection of optimal heating structure in urban areas also considering the environmental aspects. The optimization model was established in order to facilitate the decision making during selection phase of heat sources locations and defining the boundaries of their action at the pre-design phase of heat supply schemes development of settlements. Within the model is performed comparative analysis between ten heating systems, whereas as leading criteria in the comparison procedure are considered heat load density per unit of area, techno-economic aspects, and environmental impact. The optimization result actually defines the optimal heating system type in regard of the heat load density per unit area. The model provides possibility in defining standard values of heat density indicators, according to which can be assessed the economic feasibility of implementing district heating system for the selected urban area. The less value of heat density in the system, the higher specific costs for generation, distribution, and transmission of heat energy. Furthermore, the model is applied and verified for the local urban, infi-astructural, technical and environmental conditions of the city of Skopje. The process of determination of optimal heating structure has holistic approach, where, beside techno-economic aspects and feasibility, the environmental aspect of different heating systems is considered as a major factor (threat) in air pollution.

AB  - The living conditions of certain groups of Kazakhstani population, especially in regions and rural areas, where adverse factors (both environmental and anthropogenic), i.e. the quality of atmospheric air, food, and drinking water are deteriorating, might negatively affect the immune status of inhabitants and lead to the occurrence of diseases. For that reason, the restoration of immunological disorders is an urgent task, since the majority of chronic, somatic, infectious diseases are accompanied by secondary immunological failure. The algorithm of immunomodulation involves the use of pharmacological agents that can increase (immunostimulation) or reduce (immunosuppression) the level of immune response. The chronic toxicity of the immunostimulating "Virospan" drug was studied in doses of 39 mg/kg, 13 mg/kg, 4.3 mg/kg. Intranasal administration of the "Virospan" drug at a dose of 4.5 and 13 mg/kg causes a statistically significant (P <= 0.001) increase in the level of white blood cells, erythrocytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit. Against the background of a statistically significant (P <= 0.001) decrease in the level of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, an increase in lymphocytes was observed. "Virospan" at a concentration of 39 mg/kg leads to a decrease in the total number of leukocytes by 60 days and does not cause pronounced changes in the indicators of red blood, eosinophils and basophils.

AB  - The unique climate and topography of the Tibetan Plateau produce an abundant distribution of lakes. These lakes are important indicators of climate change, and changes in lake area have critical implications for water resources and ecological conditions. Lake area change can be monitored using the huge sets of high-resolution remote sensing data available, but this demands an automatic water classification system. This study develops an algorithm for automatic water classification using Chinese GF-1 (or Gaofen-1) wide-field-of-view (WFV) satellite data. The original GF-1 WFV data were automatically preprocessed with radiometric correction and orthorectification. The single-band threshold and two global-local segmentation methods were employed to distinguish water from non-water features. Three methods of determining the optimal thresholds for normalized difference water index (NDWI) images were compared: Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA); global-local segmentation with thresholds specified by stepwise iteration; and the Otsu method. The water classification from two steps of globallocal segmentations showed better performance than the single-band threshold and ISODATA methods. The GF-1 WFVbased lake mapping across the entire Tibetan Plateau in 2015 using the global-local segmentations with thresholds from the Otsu method showed high quality and efficiency in automatic water classification. This method can be extended to other satellite datasets, and makes the high-resolution global monitoring and mapping of lakes possible.

AB  - This study describes and quantifies morphological valve traits of the ostracod Limnocythere rionegroensis from Patagonian steppe lakes and explores their association with lake water characteristics. Surface ornamentation was examined by scanning electron and transmitted light microscopy, and valve size and shape were analyzed using morphometric techniques. Limnocythere rionegroensis shows remarkable variations in surface ornamentation, based on which three morphotypes (MI, MII, and MIII) were identified. Valves of morphotypes MI and MIII are larger, show slight to moderate external reticulation, and a higher shape variability, whereas MII is characterized by a very conspicuous reticulation, lower shape variability, and smaller valves. Outline analysis yielded a great shape disparity related to the dorsal margin slope. MI was found in sexual populations from euhaline to mesohaline ephemeral lake; MII occurs in parthenogenetic populations from mesohaline to oligohaline permanent or ephemeral lakes; and MIII, from both sexual and asexual populations, inhabits a broad range of environmental conditions in terms of salinity and stability. Limnocythere rionegroensis intraspecific variations may be caused by environmental parameters and genetic factors associated to reproductive strategies. These results contribute to the knowledge of extant L. rionegroensis morphological variability and provide additional clues to improve the environmental interpretation of fossil assemblages.

AB  - Human cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) is one of the most sensitive and specific indicators, used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. To produce the protein efficiently, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris systems were used. Initial trials for the expression in E. coli were not successful, although different expression vectors with different promoters were tested. This led us to use P. pastoris for the expression. After several trials with two different expression strains of P. pastoris, it was concluded that P. pastoris was also not an optimal expression host for cTnI. Comprehensive analysis of the expression systems indicated that an efficient expression is only possible when the gene is optimized for expression in E. coli. For this purpose, the gene was optimized in-silico, but edited manually afterwards. It was synthesized and cloned into pQE-2 vector. Expression was performed using routine experimental conditions. Thus, cTnI could be efficiently expressed from the optimized gene in E. coli. The expression and purification were practical and may be used for commercial purposes since a total yield of 25 mu g highly pure protein per milliliter of culture could be obtained. The protein was in its ready-to-use form for many biological applications, including as a standard in diagnostic tests and an antigen for antibody production.

AB  - The indoor air pollution with respect to indoor surface materials is characterized by volatile organic compound occurrence and perceived indoor air quality. The volatile organic compound concentrations represent an adequate indicator for indoor odors. The level of their occurrence increases with increasing amounts of non-low polluting indoor materials used. Authors' research deals with the occurrence, transfer and distribution of indoor pollutants in buildings and their relation to the HVAC systems. The effect of the interactions of selected surface materials and that of the sorption was followed in a test chamber and compared with real conditions. The chemical analysis and sensory assessments proved that commonly used interior surface materials belong to the non-low polluting materials. For most materials, the possibility of using the sorption ability of their surfaces was confirmed. The results demonstrate that the sorption ability differs for various materials and also for various combinations of the same materials. However, the sorption effect appeared to be insufficient for the indoor material combinations under study because the indoor air quality criteria were not met. The knowledge of the sorption effect can be utilized during the interior design stage already. Sustainable and aimed material combination design is considered to be a suitable tool to improve the perceived indoor air quality and to decrease the chemical pollution.

AB  - Anthropogenic metal activities have led to soil contamination, posing a severe risk to each trophic level. Therefore, eco sustainable remediation techniques and/or strategy which is the focus of this study must be continuously explored, since metal processing and accidental leakages and depositions into the environment are both inevitable in the global drive for industrialization. Different concentrations at 80-10 mg/kg of Lead (Pb), were used to contaminate a characterized (Mollisol) soil with empty fruit bunch (EFB) and spent mushroom compost (SMC) as amendments with Lantana camara alongside controls. Metal reductions ranged 52.46 to 88.03% and 45.10 to 82.73% were recorded under EFB and SMC, respectively. Heavy metal resistant bacteria (HMRB) counts of 79.67 x 10(6) to 56.1 x 10(6) CFU/g soil and 63.33 x 10(6) to 39.0 x 10(6) CFU/g soil were recorded under EFB and SMC conditions, respectively, at "Freundlich model" absorption intensity (n) of 2.51 (R-2 = 0.9840) and 2.44 (R-2 = 0.9012) in same order as above. Results validation with free energy change, kinetics and diffusion studies revealed that L. camara is a potential indicator plant for phytoremediation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the population of developed nations spending nearly 90% of their time indoors, indoor air quality (IAQ) is a critical indicator of human health risks from inhalation of airborne contaminants. We present a novel approach for qualitative monitoring of IAQ through the collection and analysis of indoor air condensate discharged from heat exchangers of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Condensate samples were collected from six suburban homes and one business in Maricopa County, Arizona, concentrated via solid-phase extraction, analyzed for 10 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and screened for additional organic compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All 10 EDCs were detected in at least one of the sampled buildings. More than 100 additional compounds were detected by GC-MS, of which 40 were tentatively identified using spectral database searches. Twelve compounds listed as designated chemicals for biomonitoring by the California Environmental Contaminant Biomonitoring Program were detected. Microfiltration of condensate samples prior to extraction had no discernable effect on contaminant concentration, suggesting that contaminants were freely dissolved or associated with inhalable, submicron particles. This study is the first to document the utility of HVAC condensate for the qualitative assessment of indoor air for pollutants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Findings of low concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in groundwater in large surveys [e.g., United States Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program (Dubrovsky, N. M.; et al. The Quality of Our Nation's Water: Nutrients in the Nation's Streams and Groundwater, 1992-2004. U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1350; USGS: Reston, VA, 2010.); >5000 wells] support the common perception that groundwater is generally of little importance for transporting phosphorus. Here, we address whether this applies to urban riparian settings, where discharging groundwater may potentially contribute to urban stream syndrome and downstream eutrophication problems. This survey study. includes 665 samples of groundwater collected along gaining stream reaches at six urban sites. Considering the combined sample set, 27% had soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations >0.1 mg L-1, which is more than double that determined in the NAWQA Program (12%), while for individual sites the range was 12-52%, excluding one site with consistently low SRP (0%). None of the sites showed significant correlation between SRP and the artificial sweetener acesulfame, a promising wastewater indicator, including two with known wastewater contamination (but the lowest SRP). Rather, high SRP concentrations were associated with geochemically reducing conditions. This could mean that natural aquifer or stream sediment materials were a primary contributor of the elevated SRP observed in this study.

AB  - The middle Yangtze Reach is one of the most developed regions of China. As a result, most lakes in this area have suffered from eutrophication and serious environmental pollution during recent decades. The aquatic biodiversity in the lakes of the area is thus currently under significant threat from continuous human activities. Testate amoebae (TA) are benthic (rarely planktonic) microorganisms characterized by an agglutinated or autogenous shell. Owing to their high abundance, preservation potential in lacustrine sediments, and distinct response to environmental stress, they are increasingly used as indicators for monitoring water quality and reconstructing palaeoenvironmental changes. However this approach has not yet been developed in China. This study presents an initial assessment of benthic TA assemblages in eight lakes of Lake Donghu in the region of Wuhan, China. Testate amoeba community structure was most strongly correlated to water pH. In more alkaline conditions, communities were dominated by Centropyxis aculeata, Difflugia oblonga, Pontigulasia compressa, Pon. elisa and Lesquereusia modesta. These results are consistent with previous studies and show that TA could be useful for reconstructing past water pH fluctuations in China. To achieve this, the next step will be to expand the database and build transfer function models.

AB  - Thermomagnetic measurements including high temperature magnetic susceptibility and high temperature magnetization, are the crucial way to distinguish magnetic minerals by determining the turning points (e. g. Curie point, Neel point or other transforming points) on thermomagnetic curves. In this study, two synthetic maghemite samples are subjected to different thermal environments (open, close, close with Ar or N-2, which defined by the air exposure degree) with 4 instruments for thermomagnetic measurements. The results turn out that Curie point and curve reversibility between heating and cooling are significantly affected by the heating environments. The Curie point corresponding to magnetite is lower in closed environment than that of maghemite in open environment. And the degree of curve irreversibility in open environment is much higher than that in closed environment. Redox environments account for the differences above. Because the maghemite in closed environment transforms into magnetite when heated up to 250 degrees C, it is impossible to be distinguished by its curie point; the final mineral in open environment (oxidizing environment) is hematite which can be determined by the Curie point. The results suggest that maghemite likely displays very differently in different heating environments. Therefore single thermomagnetic curve tends to misleading in determining magnetic minerals. Combination of measurements in different conditions is essential to obtain more accurate estimation.

AB  - Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was used in the analysis of bacterial respiratory quinone (RQ), bacterial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and archaeal phospholipid ether lipid (PLEL) from anaerobically digested sludge. Bacterial RQ were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Determination of bacterial PLFA and archaeal PLEL was simultaneously performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The effects of pressure, temperature, and modifier concentration on the total amounts of RQ, PLFA, and PLEL were investigated by 23 experiments with five settings chosen for each variable. The optimal extraction conditions that were obtained through a multiple-response optimization included a pressure of 23.6 MPa, temperature of 77.6 degrees C, and 10.6% (v/v) of methanol as the modifier. Thirty nine components of microbial lipid biomarkers were identified in the anaerobically digested sludge. Overall, the SFE method proved to be more effective, rapid, and quantitative for simultaneously extracting bacterial and archaeal lipid biomarkers, compared to conventional organic solvent extraction. This work shows the potential application of SFE as a routine method for the comprehensive analysis of microbial community structures in environmental assessments using the lipid biomarkers profile.

AB  - Vegetation surveys collect species-diversity information, a potentially valuable ecological indicator. However, the number of species recorded by vegetation surveys is influenced by several factors including inherent species-diversity, sampling method and sampling effort. The process of rarefaction is commonly used to control for variation in sampling effort. We aimed to use a combination of rarefaction and additive partitioning to control for sampling effort and extract vegetation alpha-, beta-and gamma-diversity respectively. The study focused on the Stony Plains region of the South Australian rangelands. Vegetation quadrat survey data were collected for land condition monitoring and species inventory by two government agencies. The analysis revealed a strong residual influence of sampling effort on beta-and gamma-diversity after rarefaction, a finding not previously reported in the literature. A method was developed to model then remove the residual influence of sampling effort on beta-and gamma-diversity. Thus the method outlined in this paper allows for the extraction from standard vegetation survey data of alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity and the concurrent removal of sampling effort influence. This method is transferable to any other region for which there is vegetation survey data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The postembryonic development, consumption and life table parameters of Proprioseiopsis iorgius were studied at 23 +/- 3 degrees C and 70 +/- 51% RH and a photoperiod of 14:10 h (L:D) in order to evaluate the potential of this predator for feeding on the desert spider mite Tetranychus desertorum. Eggs, nymphs, larvae and adults of T. desertorum could be considered optimal food for P iorgius, because the survival rate was 100%, 96%, 93% and 93%, respectively. The duration of postembryonic development of P. iorgius was significantly different (p < 0.05) between the distinct diets; the larval stage was the shorter duration (1.2 to 1.3 days) even though it did not feed on any stage of T. desertorum. The oviposition and postoviposition periods and longevity of P iorgius were 11.2, 3.0 and 16.8 days, respectively. Biological parameters of P. iorgius and T. desertorum were: r(m)=0.225 and 0.191; T=14.961 and 18.565; R-0=28.913 and 34.357, lambda=1.252 and 1.210, respectively. The high values of r(m) and lambda found for P. iorgius under the experimental conditions are indicators of the control potential that this phytoseiid mite could have as a predator of T. desertorum.

AB  - The region of San Pedro de Atacama, Northern Chile, has undergone several cultural and social changes after humans settled in Atacama Desert around 500 BC. The Atacameno people experienced the highest degree of social and cultural changes between 400 and 900 AD when they were assimilated into the Tiwanaku trade and political web that influenced most of the Central-Southern Andes. Under the influence of Tiwanaku, San Pedro de Atacama experienced its greatest economic development. Prior analyses of local human skeletal remains have shown a significant increase in the stature of the local population during the same period. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the Tiwanaku influence on the local epidemiological profile using the incidence of periostitis and osteomyelitis as indicators of biological stress. Surprisingly, the best epidemiological condition occurred during the final phase of influence of Tiwanaku (910-960 AD), and not during the apex influence (480-920 AD), as expected by the archaeological context. We suggest that population growth and aggregation may have counteracted the benefits of improved nutrition during the peak Tiwanaku influence. A severe drought occurred between 1,100 and 1,400 AD in Northern Chile. This could also explain the marked increase of bone infections in the post-Tiwanaku period (920-1,240 AD).

AB  - We reported on the transit and survival of 6 potentially pathogenic bacterial populations in a schist aquifer beneath the Etueffont landfill (France). Total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus were monitored for 15 months in groundwater and leachate and coupled to tracer tests in an attempt to identify the source of contamination. The results showed the absence of S. aureus and Salmonella. The monitoring of piezometer 30 (PZ30) located downstream from the landfill highlighted leachate infiltrations into the substrate. Groundwater analysis showed high levels of faecal bacteria in the underground environment (20,000 CFU 100 mL(-1) for total coliforms, 15,199 CFU 100 mL(-1) for E. coli and 3290 CFU 100 mL(-2) for Enterococci). Data from tracer tests indicated that bacteria originated from the septic tank of the transfer station and part of these bacteria transited through waste. Bacterial density was lower in leachates than in groundwater sampled from PZ30, except for P. aeruginosa which seemed to take advantage of adverse environmental conditions. The landfill, closed since 2002, was not a source of faecal bacteria which appeared to be able to survive in the schist substrate, and may be considered as good markers of recent faecal contamination.

AB  - In this work, we propose an innovative application of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) as a methodological approach for the chemical characterisation of black crusts on stone monuments, associated with traditional micro-morphological (optical and scanning electron microscopy) and infrared spectroscopic techniques (FTIR).
   This new approach was tested on black crusts developing on two marble substrates, one, the columns of the San Cosimato cloister in Rome, and the other, a sculpture representing an angel, located in Pessano con Bornago, a small industrial town near Milan.
   The main aim of this study was to develop and test the reliability of the LA-ICP-MS analytical method on black crusts and to explore the idea that trace element concentrations in black crusts can be applied to investigate their origin and the relations between concentrations of polluting elements in black crusts and environmental conditions.
   The results obtained by applying traditional techniques find considerable support in the innovative method used here, which could determine the concentrations of a large number of trace elements (including heavy metals) in the black crusts examined, and thus could also be used as a reliable indicator of environmental pollution.

AB  - Height above water table in aquatic habitats has long been recognized as the key factor for determining the spatial structure of bryophyte assemblages. Using photosynthetic pigments as indicators of stress along a wet-to-dry gradient, I tested whether different habitat preferences were revealed. A field experiment was set up to obtain a semi-natural hydrological gradient. The spatial distribution of species was quantified by determining the pigment content in natural assemblages and by applying the regression equations derived from the experimental manipulation. The species were able to move water in quantities that were statistically significantly different from each other, which was in agreement with the species characteristics and the colony architectures. Photosynthetic pigments responded in a complex way to the water gradient and, for each species, one or more stress indicators were reliable. A wide overlapping of spatial distribution exists in natural conditions, especially in complex habitats like springs. Although in this study a restricted selection of species has been examined, the method proposed to evaluate the theoretical height above water table is coherent with the broad spatial pattern observed. This approach may be particularly useful for understanding both the coexistence of similar species and the spatial distributions of bryophytes in spring habitats in relation to water stress tolerance.

AB  - The concentration fluctuations resulting from hazardous releases in the subsurface are modeled through the concentration moments. The local solute exposure concentration, resulting from the heterogeneous velocity field and pore scale dispersion in the subsurface, is a random function characterized by its statistical moments. The approximate solution to the exact equation that describes the evolution of concentration standard moments in the aquifer transport is proposed in a recursive form. The expressions for concentration second, third and fourth central moments are derived and evaluated for various flow and transport conditions. The solutions are sought by starting from the exact upper bound solution with the zero pore scale dispersion and introducing the physically based approximation that allows the inclusion of the pore scale dispersion resulting in simple closed-form expressions for the concentration statistical moments. The concentration moments are also analyzed in the relative and absolute frame of reference indicating their combined importance in the practical cases of the subsurface contaminant plume migration. The influence of pore scale dispersion with different source sizes and orientations are analyzed and discussed with respect to common cases in the environmental risk assessment problems. The results are also compared with the concentration measurements of the conservative tracer collected in the field experiments at Cape Cod and Borden Site. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - When an environmental problem involves several agents, different environmental indicators can be chosen. In this paper we derive axiomatically an indicator of "environmental responsibility", the quantitative contribution of each agent to the environmental problem. This indicator must possess properties that most agents are likely to accept. Apart from a normalization condition, that indicator must be: (1) additive, implying that the responsibility of a set of agents is the sum of the responsibilities of each agent; (2) account for indirect effects under economic causality, implying that the agent that benefits economically from an environmental damage is responsible for it; (3) monotonic in direct environmental pressure, implying that the responsibility of a given agent cannot decrease if its actions lead to an overall worsening of the environmental problem; (4) symmetric in production and consumption, meaning that if the contribution of an agent's consumption and production behavior is interchanged, that agent's responsibility cannot change. We prove that an indicator fulfilling these properties exists and is unique, given by the average of the environmental pressure generated to produce the primary inputs and the final demand of an agent. The existence of a unique indicator of environmental responsibility can facilitate cooperation in environmental agreements and raise commitment in the implementation of environmental policies.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of tardigrades in the city of General Pico (Argentina) are analyzed from samples collected during autumn and spring 2001. Sample sites included paved urban locations with different traffic intensities, non-paved periurban places, and places with peculiar conditions such as the city industrial area and the bus station. Trees of the same species were selected in each area and from each of them nine subsamples of lichens and/or moss, 11 mm in diameter, were taken with steel corers. The diversity, density and relative abundance of tardigrades was recorded and analyzed. Sampling sites were ordinated and classified with PCA and clustering. The number total of species collected in the research was 5. The maximum number of species per site and per tree was 4. The species recorded were: Echiniscus rufoviridis, Milnesium cf. tardigradum, Ramazzottius oberhaeuseri, Macrobiotus areolatus and an undescribed species of the genus Macrobiotus. The average density was approximately 10 specimens per cm(2) and the maximum values reach over 50 specimens per cm(2). R. oberhaeuseri and M. cf. tardigradum were the most frequent species. R. oberhaeuseri dominates in periurban areas with high suspension dust and very exposed to the sun. M. cf. tardigradum dominates on paved streets with intense vehicle traffic. Results supported the hypothesis of the relationship between air quality and tardigrade diversity.

AB  - Organic farming according to EU 2092/91 aims at closed nutrient cycles, which means that external nutrient inputs are kept to a minimum. By comparison, conventional farming is input orientated, focusing on high crop productivity. Soil analytical methods for organic farming comprise physical, biological, chemical, and energetic soil tests. The spade diagnosis is an old field test to obtain "in situ" information about soil fertility, which has experienced a renaissance in organic farming. At the laboratory level, organic farming uses the standard chemical analytical methods used in conventional agriculture comprising the determination of organic matter, humus dynamics, pH, soluble plant nutrients and reserve fractions. Special attention is paid to phosphorus, which is determined in three different extracts (acetic, lactic, and citric acid) to assess phosphorus dynamics, which is an indicator of the turnover of organic matter. Compared with conventional agriculture, biological methods are of particular interest in organic farming. Soil biological methods, such as the release Of CO2, nitrification, dehydrogenase, amylase and. protease activities, reflect the biological activity of soils. Problems of biological methods are the high spatiotemporal variability in dependence on biotic, pedogenetic, and climatic conditions and the lack of interpretation schemes for a transformation into practical recommendations. The soil chroma test is a method that aims to analyze energetic processes in soils. It is a so-called "picture forming" method and characteristic for the biodynamic school of organic farming.

AB  - Oxygen concentration fields in a water body were Visualized by the fluorescence oxygen visualization (FOV) method. Pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) Was used as a flourescent indicator of oxygen, and an intensive charge coupled-device (ICCD) camera as an image detector. Sequential images (over 2000 images) of the oxygen concentration field around the surface water of the tank (1 x 1 x 0.75 m(3)) were produced during the 3 h experiment. From image processing. the accurate pathway of oxygen-rich, cold water at the water surface was also visualized. The amount of oxygen transferred through the air-water interface during the experiment was measured and the oxygen transfer coefficient (K-L) was determined as 0.22 m/d, which was Much higher than that is expected in molecular diffusion. Results Suggest that vertical penetration of cold water was the main pathway of oxygen in the water body in the tank. The average velocity of cold water penetrating downward in water body was also measured from consecutive images and the value was 0.3-0.6 mm/s. The FOV method used in this research should have wide application in experimental fluid mechanics and can also provide a phenomenological description of oxygen transfer Under physically realizable natural conditions in lakes and reservoirs.

AB  - In this paper we report the results of electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) that was used to study environmental materials. The mode of preparation and certification of reference samples based on a basaltic glass matrix for environmental applications of EPMA is described. These samples were prepared containing scandium, strontium and barium (from 0.03 up to 7% m/m) and an evaluation was made of homogeneity, their stability to local heating, followed by analysis by independent methods for certification of composition. Matrix correction procedures for the EPMA technique have been developed for particles having a size commensurable with the volume of X-ray generation. An analytical equation for the size factor is proposed and two techniques for selecting optimum conditions for the analysis of environmental samples by EPMA are reported. These procedures provided satisfactory results when utilized in analysing sediments recovered from snow, coal fly ash and the bones of animals and fish, results from which can be used as indicators for evaluating the pollution level of the lower atmosphere, surface and ground water, as well as revealing pollution mechanisms.

AB  - Use of antibiotics in subtherapeutic doses as growth-promoting feed additives for animal production is widespread in the U.S. and throughout the world. Previous studies by our research group concluded that size fractionation of poultry (broiler) litter followed by storage facilitated reutilization of litter as a soil amendment or bedding supplement. However, litter microbial contamination, including antibiotic-resistant populations, and accumulation of metals and other elements may limit litter reutilization. Litter from four broiler houses was separated into a fine fraction for use as a soil amendment, and a coarse fraction for reutilization as a bedding supplement in growing subsequent flocks of broilers. Fractions and whole litter were stored in indoor piles simulating farm storage conditions for 4 mo with periodic analysis for metals, other elements, and culturable bacteria (including total and fecal coliform, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni). Representative bacterial isolates were tested for their sensitivity to 12 common antibiotics (ampicillin, bacitracin, cephalothin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline) using the Kirby-Bauer technique. Pathogens and indicator bacteria tested were found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics. Data suggest that microbial contamination of litter should be reduced or eliminated prior to reutilization to minimize environmental health risks related to transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans or other animals.

AB  - Hyperthermia induces transient changes in [Na+](i) and [K+](i) in mammalian cells. Since Cl- flux is coupled with Nat and K+ in several processes, including cell volume control, we have measured the effects of heat on [Cl-](i) using the chloride indicator, MQAE, with flow cytometry. The mean basal level of [Cl-](i) in Chinese hamster ovary cells was 12 mM. Cells heated at 42.0 degrees or 45.0 degrees C for 30 min had about a 2.5-fold increase in [Cl-](i) above unheated control values when measured immediately after heating. There was about a 3-fold decrease in [Na+](i) under the same conditions, as measured by Sodium Green, The magnitude of the increase in [Cl-](i) depended upon time and temperature. The [Cl-](i) recovered in a time-dependent fashion to control values by 30 min after heating. When cells were heated at 45.0 degrees C for 30 min in the presence of 1.5 mM furosemide, the heat-induced [Cl-](i) increase was completely blocked. Since furosemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter, Cl- channels, and even Cl-HCO3 exchange, these ion transporters may be involved in the heat-induced increase in [Cl-](i).

AB  - Horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis was used to characterize the genetic structure of central mudminnow (Umbra limi) populations from acid-stressed (low pH/high Al) and nonacid-stressed sites in the north branch of the Moose River (NBMR), New York, in order to determine if environmental shifts were accompanied by detectable shifts in genetic structure. Central mudminnow populations in the NBMR were characterized by significantly (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) lower heterozygosity levels at stressed sites (H (mean number of heterozygotes per locus per individual) = 0.060-0.102) than reference sites (H = 0. 130, 0.142). Additionally, several genetic loci demonstrated either consistent (isocitrate dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) or moderately consistent (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-1, malate dehydrogenase-1, mannose-6-phosphate isomerase) genotypic shifts in comparisons between populations at reference and low pH/high Al sites. Populations at acid-stressed sites were characterized by higher frequencies of one particular allozyme, suggesting that environmental conditions were acting as a selective force. In acute laboratory toxicity tests (pH, 4.5; Al, 7.5 mg/L), the most tolerant fish were significantly more genetically variable, indicating that genetic diversity may be beneficial to the survival of individual fish experiencing physiological stress.

AB  - Sphagnum mosses were collected from four ombrotrophic bogs in two regions of southern Germany: Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern, OB) and the Northern Black Forest (Nordschwarzwald, NBF). Surfaces of Sphagnum carpets were marked with plastic mesh and, one year later, plant matter was harvested and productivity determined. Major and trace element concentrations (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, Zn) were determined in acid digests using sector field ICP-MS. Up to 12 samples (40 x 40 cm) were collected per site, and 6-10 sites investigated per bog. Variation in element accumulation rates within a bog is mostly the result of the annual production rate of the Sphagnum mosses which masks not only the impact of site effects, such as microtopography and the presence of dwarf trees, but also local and regional conditions, including land use in the surrounding area, topography, etc. The difference in productivity between peat bogs results in distinctly higher element accumulation rates at the NBF bogs compared to those from OB for all studied elements. The comparison with the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP; wet-only and total deposition) and Modelling of Air Pollutants and Ecosystem Impact (MAPESI; total deposition) data shows that accumulation rates obtained using Sphagnum are in the same range of published values for direct measurements of atmospheric deposition of As, Cd, Cu, Co, Pb, and V in both regions. The accordance is very dependent on how atmospheric deposition rates were obtained, as different models to calculate the deposition rates may yield different fluxes even for the same region. In future studies of atmospheric deposition of trace metals, both Sphagnum moss and deposition collectors have to be used on the same peat bog and results compared. Antimony, however, shows considerable discrepancy, because it is either under-estimated by Sphagnum moss or over-estimated by both atmospheric deposition models. Atmospheric deposition data obtained from sampling in open fields is unlikely to always perfectly match data obtained using living Sphagnum moss from bogs. In fact, plant uptake and biochemical utilization by living moss may affect accumulation rates of those elements that are essential for plant nutrition (macro and micronutrients), which is clearly seen in the data presented here for Mn, Fe and Zn. Furthermore, Sphagnum moss is a unique receptor, with its characteristic roughness and chemical complexity. These two aspects, combined with conditions found on the bog surface (variations in microtopography, shrubs, trees, wetness, snow cover, etc.), result in a unique type of interception and retention. Despite all these factors, the comparison with modelled data shows that Sphagnum moss is a good indicator of atmospheric deposition at least in a semi-quantitative manner and certainly reflects inputs to terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction. The processes of mobile objects control are deploying in space and time on the basis of current scientific concepts. They are inseparably connected with the processes of transformation of matter, energy and information. Therefore the feasibility of using the information theory mathematical apparatus to analyze of management processes in general, and the mobile objects radio control processes becomes clear. The static approach to this problem is based on determining the amount of information that must be entered in the control loop to reduce the entropy of the control object from a starting value to a final value. The entropy determines the accuracy of the control. The dynamic control process remains hidden. It does not enable to establish the necessary control time, the laws entropy reduce and the relationship between the main indicators of the control process.
   Problem statement. Radio control systems have one thing: the entropy of the control object and control process is reduced because the control information supplied. Entropy is the objective characteristic of control precision. The information consists of the initial information and the operation information. The initial information is a set of pre-collected data about the properties of the control object, the disturbance and other factors. Working information is extracted in the control process. It is necessary to create the control process dynamic model which reveals the patterns of change in the control object entropy both in the absence and presence of control information. It should be appreciated that as the law of entropy reduction and the amount of control information depend on the organization of control process and the nature of information exchange between the control part and the control object.
   Theoretical results. The radio control system decomposition is made. The iformation communications between the object and the control section are considered. The time needed to reduce the entropy to the prescribed value is set. The situation that occurs in conditions of increasing entropy unmanaged object is analyzed. Conditions entropy reduction in the event of control information and necessary control time are mounted. A situation where the known the radio control system potential is analyzed. The loss of information impact in the control object on the change in entropy pattern is considered. The needed control time in a loss of information is established. The possibility of implementing the control process in a loss of information defined.
   Conclusion. Based on the proposed dynamic models entropy analysis of radio control process is executed. The relationship between the entropy of the control object and the speed of control information entry is installed. The necessary control time to reduce the entropy is determined. The radio control systems potential possibilities are took into account. The impact of information loss in control object to reduce the entropy is studied. The effect of feedback between the control object and control part on the process dynamics is established. These results provide a new level of radio control process analysis of moving objects.

AB  - The accurate measurement of environmentally-relevant gases such as ammonia (NH3) is increasingly important, especially in agricultural science. Accurate and continuous measurement of gases is essential for evaluating NH3 and other gases as resource-based indicators of air quality in forced ventilation barns and for determining emission rates. To better assess measuring devices under different barn conditions (e.g. relative humidity or concentration range) self-conducted tests should be implemented at the laboratory scale before, during and after (experimental) measurements in the barn, independent of the manufacturer's specifications. Therefore, in this study, a gas calibration unit was set up for measurements at the laboratory scale. Moreover, measurement protocols were developed to investigate the accuracy at different gas concentrations and relative humidity levels and the responsiveness to rapid gas concentration changes. Measurements were performed with photoacoustic gas analysers (INNOVA 1412) and transmitters with electrochemical gas sensors (Polytron 8100 and C300). In addition to the presentation of results of the devices used in this case, this study should above all offer suggestions for quality monitoring to test sensors more intensively at the laboratory scale in order to be able to use them in a more targeted manner according to their optimal suitability.

AB  - Energy demand is increasingly the most relevant cost item in chemical plants. Operating expenses indeed play a main role in all plants processing large amounts of feedstock via well-established processes in the petrochemical industry. In staged operations, the optimal number of stages is usually obtained by means of an economic optimization. However, the designed equipment, external duties, and thus operating expenses may considerably vary under the effect of external disturbances. The main purpose of this paper is to outline a simple but effective procedure to account for perturbations in the assessment of the optimal number of stages. The analysis shows that appropriate investments could lead to a unit design able to mitigate the higher duty requirements when external perturbations occur. The results highlight that the optimal number of stages varies when uncertainty is considered and, with low computational effort, this can be effectively quantified by means of the applied methodology. Furthermore, the same approach has been applied to sustainability indicators over the uncertain domain as well. In those cases, when more stages correspond to more flexible equipment, the environmental impact is positively affected, and a double benefit can be observed.

AB  - Human activities may change beta diversity-the spatial variation in species composition-in different ways. Positive and negative trends in beta diversity are referred as biotic differentiation and homogenization, respectively. In this context, river damming is likely to be a major cause of changes in beta diversity over time. Here, we evaluated the impact of damming on zooplankton beta diversity in two Brazilian reservoirs. We predicted that damming would cause biotic differentiation due to the creation of areas with different hydrological conditions, which would allow the colonization and population growth of species belonging to different zooplankton groups. Our results for the total zooplankton community were consistent with the hypothesis of biotic differentiation, either due to the increased mean beta diversity or due to the tendency of increasing beta diversity over time after damming. An indicator species analysis also showed that a large proportion of taxa that can be categorized as euplanktonic were mainly indicators of the period after damming, whereas the opposite was true for testate amoebae. Increased beta diversity should be interpreted as an impact of damming. However, we speculate that, under a process of water quality deterioration, biotic homogenization is likely to occur, reversing the patterns we observed.

AB  - Andrographis Herb, defined as the aerial parts of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees, is one of the widely used herbal products, officially recommended for the symptomatic relief of common cold. The herb, however, has a very short-termed stability, which has been a major problem in the storage and distribution of its raw materials and products. To monitor the chemical degradation and stability of Andrographis Herb holistically, a H-1 NMR-based metabolomics workflow was used to map the chemical profiles in the raw materials stored in the standard storage conditions over a 6-month period. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the NMR data from the CHCl3 and aq MeOH extracts of the herb traced the decomposition of diterpene lactones, particularly through the changes in contents and composition ratios, as indicators that signified the stability of Andrographis Herb. Specifically, 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide was suggested by PCA as a potential candidate to be a stability and/or age marker of the herb. In parallel, the degradation of active constituents in Andrographis Herb was also examined through the determination of total lactones content using the standard titrimetric method, from which t(90%)s were estimated to be as short as 3-5 months.

AB  - Solar photovoltaic technologies are increasingly implemented in airport premises. In certain conditions of sun path, the glare from solar photovoltaic modules may the reduce visibility of pilots and air traffic controllers. Despite the threat to aviation safety with solar installations in airport, only a few countries have framed regulation on glare impact. The paper attempts to study the various factors affecting the occurrence of glare from solar PV array in Airport. The main objective is to review the approaches and metrics for assessing the glare impact from the solar photovoltaic array. In addition, the work summarises the glare guidelines existing in USA, Canada and European nations. The main factors that influence the glare occurrence are suns position, tilt angle, Surface texture, color and location of PV module. It was concluded that the existing glare assessment approaches are of limited practical use in the worldwide scenario. Though there are several limitations with the existing glare indices, the Ho et al metrics is reasonably a good indicator for glare assessment in airport solar PV installations. Guidelines formulated by Federal Aviation Administration, (FAA), USA is good enough to be used as guideline for glare impact assessment in other countries. It is envisaged that this work will assist the research communities for the development of the globally acceptable glare assessment and metrics.

AB  - The eutrophication of lake ecosystems due to anthropogenic activities has impacted lakes worldwide and shallow lakes are particularly vulnerable. The retention of phosphorus (P) in lake sediments and its subsequent release to the water column is often a key factor in degraded water quality, algal blooms and delayed responses to lake restoration efforts. Despite this link between sedimentary P and poor ecosystem outcomes, a limited amount of research has been conducted on P dynamics in New Zealand's lakes. In this study, sediments in six shallow lakes across the country were analysed for geochemistry and P fractionation. Total sedimentary P content varied widely and was related to inflow concentrations and hydrological retention times. The P binding capacity of the sediments was related to iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) concentrations, while the Fe:P ratio was correlated to the release of P under anoxic conditions. P fractions and release rates were poorly correlated with traditional water quality parameters, however the mobile-P-SL and reducible-P fractions were strongly correlated with the frequency of summertime algal blooms. This relationship may provide an indicator to assess harmful algal bloom frequency in unmonitored lakes, and a valuable tool to assess internal loading risk and inform lake restoration methods.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease that causes inflammation throughout the digestive tract. Repeated inflammation and frequent relapses cause intestinal damage and expose the patient to a higher risk. In this work, we proposed an immune therapy model for effective treatment strategy through mathematical modeling for patients with IBD. We evaluated the ability of the patient's immune system to recover during treatment. For this, we defined the interval of healthy individual, and examined the frequency of compartments such as T cells and cytokines considered in the model maintain the normal state. Based on the fact that each patient has a unique immune system, we have shown at the same drug works differently, depending on the individual immune system characteristics for every patient. It is known that IBD is related to an imbalance between pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines as the cause of the disease. So the ratios of pro- to anti- inflammatory cytokines are used as an indicator of patient's condition and inflammation status in various diseases. We compared the ratios of pro- to anti- inflammatory cytokine according to patient's individual immune system and drugs. Since the effects of biological drugs are highly dependent on the patient's own immune system, it is essential to define the immune system status before selecting and using a biological drug.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are considered emerging pollutants and often enter aquatic ecosystems carried by currents and tides until they accumulate on the shorelines. In many cases they may be colonized by diverse microorganisms forming a community called plastisphere, which can even act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms. This study carried out in the Rio de la Plata estuary (southern coastal fringe, Argentina) focused on two main objectives, the analysis of the biofilm colonizing MPs under laboratory conditions, and the detection of bacteria indicating faecal contamination (Escherichia coli and Enterococci), in MPs from the intertidal sediment at coastal sites with different land uses, in the freshwater sector of the Rio de la Plata estuary. The colonization experiment was carried out in the laboratory with water from the estuary for a period of 35 days (residence time of the water in the freshwater sector of the estuary). The results revealed a remarkable development and diversity of biofilm organisms from the second week of colonization on, covering the surface of the microplastic and thus masking this pollutant. On the other hand, the presence of faecal indicator bacteria in the MPs of the intertidal sediment was confirmed in all the studied sites, being proportionally higher on MPs found in areas influenced by sewage discharges

AB  - Access to improved sanitation technologies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is very low. Despite the importance of improved sanitation technologies in sanitation monitoring, little attention has been given towards the types and distributions of improved sanitation technologies used in SSA. This paper presents an analysis of the distribution of improved sanitation technologies in SSA, with particular emphasis on factors influencing their distribution. Study data were derived from demographic health surveys, multiple indicator cluster surveys and World Bank Development Indicators. Results showed that the pit latrine with slab was the most prevalent technology (21%), while the composting toilet had the least coverage (0.6%). Multiple regression analysis results showed positive significant relationships between the following: income and flush toilets connected to sewer (p = 0.000), urban population and flush toilets connected to septic tanks (p = 0.000), development assistance and pit latrine with slab (p = 0.035) and a negative relationship between population and flush toilets connected to pit latrines (p = 0.030). The paper concluded that selection of sanitation technologies is influenced by different factors. In addition, prevailing socio-economic conditions can result in selection of inappropriate technologies. Technology selection, however, should strive to strike a balance between the economic, environmental, human health and socio-cultural sustainability aspects of sanitation.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to propose a benchmark methodology for forecasting industrial electricity demand in unsteady socio-economic environments such as developing countries using various aspects of socio-economic parameters. Iran's industrial electricity demand after cutting off subsidies is analysed as our case study. The study uses data of 19 countries for the years 1993-2008 for benchmarking due to their similarities to Iran. Moreover, nine indexes of life expectancy rate, human population density, literacy rate, human development index, total healthcare expenditure, gender equality index, R&D spending rate, motor vehicle rate, and CO2 emission rate are considered in our study as benchmarking indicators. The essence of the benchmark methodology is based on log-log equilibrium of industrial electricity consumption versus price of electricity, population of users and value added. Regression is applied to all the data and proper coefficients are calculated for each of the selected countries to be used in the benchmark model. Subsequently, price elasticity and other coefficients to be used in electricity demand prediction of Iran is estimated from the viewpoint of each benchmarking index using the results obtained for the 19 countries. Lastly, an equation is presented for forecasting future electricity demand.

AB  - The aim of the research was to compare the effects of various petroleum products, biodiesel, diesel oil, fuel oil and unleaded petrol on soil dehydrogenases, and to evaluate biostimulation with compost and urea in the restoration of homeostasis of the soil contaminated with these products. The obtained results allowed for defining the weight of dehydrogenases in monitoring of the environment subjected to pressure from petroleum hydrocarbons. The studies were carried out under laboratory conditions for 180 days, and loamy sand was the soil formation used in the experiment. The petroleum products were used in the following amounts: 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 g kg(-1) DM of soil. Indices of the influence of the petroleum product and the stimulating substance on the activity of dehydrogenases were calculated. It was proved that the petroleum products affect soil dehydrogenases in various ways. Biodiesel, diesel oil and fuel oil stimulate these enzymes, while petrol acts as an inhibitor. Among the substances tested regarding biostimulation of soils contaminated with petroleum products, compost is definitely more useful than urea, and therefore, the former should be used for the remediation of such soils. Stimulation of dehydrogenases by compost, both in contaminated and non-contaminated soils, proves that it may accelerate microbiological degradation of petroleum-derived contaminants.

AB  - Diatoms are responsible for 75 % of the primary production in high-nutrient and coastal regions of the ocean, and their growth is sometimes limited by silicon availability. We investigated the genetic diversity of silicon transporter (Sit) genes and measured Sit gene expression in one dominant genus, Chaetoceros, as a molecular indicator of silicon deficiency in the East China Sea (ECS). A total of 34 Sit fragments were sequenced from species belonging to 13 genera. These sequences covered 12 genera of which no Sit sequences have been previously reported; thus, this information has greatly expanded the Sit gene database. These sequences were combined with the existing Sit sequences in GenBank, and the combined set was used to sort the homologous Sit identified in the ECS. Based on the Sit sequence alignments, specific primers were designed for the Chaetoceros genus to quantitatively estimate Sit expression levels using quantitative RT-PCR. In a cruise conducted in July 2010, the observed Chaetoceros Sit transcript levels were comparable in range to those detected in the species, C. affinis, cultured under silicon-sufficient conditions. This finding may be explained by the devastating 2010 flood of the Changjiang River, which resulted in the influx of a large amount of silicic acid to the ECS.

AB  - The exchange of coherent arguments about methods applied in the field of climate change adaptation is challenging due to the growing diversity of analytical methods applied from natural science and social science. This is further complicated by the abstract and ambiguous terms, such as vulnerability and adaptive capacity, employed in the literature and the inadequate consideration given to the wider array of social science methods that are being applied now that adaptation has become a practical necessity. To address these limitations, a review and novel classification of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation methods is presented. Methods are classified based on goals addressed, thematic clusters of variables involved, and underlying theoretical assumptions. On the top-level, methods are distinguished into impact analysis, behavior analysis, institutional analysis, and decision analysis methods. The first three branches are further classified according to descriptive, explanatory, and predictive goals, as well as theoretical assumptions. For each type, empirical conditions of applicability and examples from the literature are presented. While this classification can only be partial due to the ever growing methodological diversity in the field of climate change adaptation, we provide a more rigorous basis for the coherent exchange of methodological arguments and thereby hope to foster the interdisciplinary dialog needed to advance the field.

AB  - Many recent ecotoxicological studies suggest a relationship between freshwater contamination and increasing abundances of motile diatoms (potentially able to move). The capacity to escape would present advantages to species in polluted environments. However, actual motility as a response to toxicants had not been described and required experimental validation.
   We designed a specific experiment to assess how a field-isolated diatom (Gomphonema gracile) distributes energy to in situ resistance (increased population growth or photosynthesis) and escape (behavioral changes), when exposed to increasing concentrations of the herbicide metolachlor.
   We report here the dose-time dependent responses of G. gracile populations. They coped with low contamination by resisting in situ, with early hormetic responses highlighted by stimulation of chlorophyll-a fluorescence. At a higher dose, harmful impacts were observed on growth after a few days, but an earlier behavioral response suggested that higher motility (percentage of motile individuals and mean distance crossed) could be involved in escape.
   Our findings bring new arguments to support the implementation of real measurements instead of motility traits in toxicity assessment. Specifically, motion descriptors have been used as early-warning indicators of contamination in our study. Further works should address the reliability of these endpoints in more complex conditions (interspecific variability, behavior in the field). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current study assessed main effects and moderators (including emotional expressiveness, emotional processing, and ambivalence over emotional expression) of the effects of expressive writing in a sample of healthy adults. Young adult participants (N=116) were randomly assigned to write for 20 minutes on four occasions about deepest thoughts and feelings regarding their most stressful/traumatic event in the past five years (expressive writing) or about a control topic (control). Dependent variables were indicators of anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms. No significant effects of writing condition were evident on anxiety, depressive symptoms, or physical symptoms. Emotional expressiveness emerged as a significant moderator of anxiety outcomes, however. Within the expressive writing group, participants high in expressiveness evidenced a significant reduction in anxiety at three-month follow-up, and participants low in expressiveness showed a significant increase in anxiety. Expressiveness did not predict change in anxiety in the control group. These findings on anxiety are consistent with the matching hypothesis, which suggests that matching a person's naturally elected coping approach with an assigned intervention is beneficial. These findings also suggest that expressive writing about a stressful event may be contraindicated for individuals who do not typically express emotions.

AB  - Pollution can drive rapid evolutionary change in wild populations. This study targets functional polymorphisms of chronically metal-contaminated wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens). A de novo transcriptome scan contrasted subsets of individuals from clean (n = 16) and contaminated (n = 16) lakes to identify 87 candidate annotated coding SNPs. Candidate genotypes and liver [metal] were obtained in 10 populations (n = 1,052) and a genome scan distinguished outliers: one nuclear (cyclin G1 gene) and two mitochondrial (cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes) also displaying allelic correlation to mean population [cadmium]. Whole mtDNA and 17 kb surrounding cyclin G1 were characterised through 454 sequencing thus revealing two non-synonymous substitutions involving dissimilar amino acids. Based on associated functions and inter-population differentiation, contaminated perch may have been selected for fast life cycle completion (p53 pathway) and memorization impairment mitigation (long-term potentiation pathway). In accordance with predicted evolutionary trajectory for stressed and energy deprived organisms, adapted perch would not compensate for repair mechanism inhibition, instead reallocating energy towards growth and favouring inexpensive impairment mitigation adaptations over costly detoxification. Overall, 85 years of selection could have driven rapid, potentially adaptive evolution by selecting alleles increasing perch fitness in polluted environments.

AB  - Soils are major contributors to global nutrient cycling processes, which are indispensable for the healthy functioning of our ecosystems. In this study, we raise the question whether soil functioning can be captured in a concept denominated normal operating range (NOR), or the normal fluctuations in soil functioning under field conditions. We further examine how this concept could be effectively used to evaluate the impact of disturbances on agricultural ecosystems. We propose the establishment of a NOR on the basis of multiple parameters in the soil. These should include so-called sensitive processes, that is, those processes that are poorly redundant and easily deviate following a stress situation. The model that we built allowed to visualize the interplay of multiple soil parameters, under which the sensitive ones, which would be most indicative of a disturbance. Here we use the initial step of nitrification, i.e. ammonia oxidation, as an example of a sensitive process. By capturing the normal fluctuations in ammonia oxidation-related parameters that take into account population dynamics, and implementing these in a mathematical model, a multidimensional representation of the NOR of soil function is created which is useful in tests of resilience in the context of disturbances.

AB  - Resilience is widely used from a variety of research perspectives; however, community resilience in particular is applied to a number of natural hazards and disasters-related studies, programs, and activities. It is also acknowledged that its measurement is cumbersome but not impossible. The prime objective of this paper is to measure the community resilience of an earthquake-prone area in Baluchistan. The article presents the concept of resilience, its approaches, selection of indicators, formulation of subjective assessment method for weighting the indicators, and finally, developing the community resilience index. For the community resilience measurement, a survey was conducted among 200 households in two earthquake risk zones of Quetta city, using simple random sampling method. The overall composite community resilience index revealed that the resilience is low in both the zones-A and B. However, it is revealed that there is a significant difference between the zones when compared against the components and indicators. Community resilience components such as economic, institutional, and physical have received higher index values in Zone B as compared to Zone A. Based on the findings, it is recommended to improve the socioeconomic, institutional, and structural (housing) conditions of the community by raising the community awareness and preparedness, implementing building codes, and providing income-generating activities in order to enhance the community resilience to cope up with earthquake hazards in the future.

AB  - A total of 450 different colonies, isolated from 25 samples of dromedary milk collected from La (a) over cap youne region of Morocco, were tested for antimicrobial compounds production. Out of these, 30 were determined to be lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and able to inhibit the growth of the indicator strain Listeria innocua CECT 4030. Seven isolates were selected by the large and clear zones of inhibition when tested by the agar well diffusion assay. They were classified by phenotypic and biochemical analysis as two Enterococcus durans (E204 and E214), two Lactococcus lactis (R75 and R76), one Enterococcus faecium R111, one Lactococcus cremoris R112 and one Enterococcus avium R122. Their antimicrobial compounds were detected in cell-free culture supernatant fluids under conditions that eliminate acid and hydrogen peroxide inhibition. The antimicrobial activity was altered after treatment with trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, pepsin or papain which confirms the proteinaceous nature of the inhibition. It was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and also active over a wide pH range (2 to 10). This fact suggests that bacteriocin-like produced by the seven LAB strains may find application as biopreservatives in food products.

AB  - Monitoring of microbiological contaminants in water supplies requires fast and sensitive methods for the specific detection of indicator organisms or pathogens. We developed a protocol for the simultaneous detection of E. coli and coliform bacteria based on the Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) technology. This protocol consists of two approaches. The first allows the direct detection of single E. coli and coliform bacterial cells on the filter membranes. The second approach includes incubation of the filter membranes on a nutrient agar plate and subsequent detection of the grown micro-colonies. Both approaches were validated using drinking water samples spiked with pure cultures and naturally contaminated water samples. The effects of heat, chlorine and UV disinfection were also investigated. The micro-colony approach yielded very good results for all samples and conditions tested, and thus can be thoroughly recommended for usage as an alternative method to detect E. coli and coliform bacteria in water samples. However, during this study, some limitations became visible for the single cell approach. The method cannot be applied for water samples which have been disinfected by UV irradiation. In addition, our results indicated that green fluorescent dyes are not suitable to be used with chlorine disinfected samples.

AB  - The Sinos River basin is located Northeast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul (29 degrees 20' to 30 degrees 10' S and 50 degrees 15' to 51 degrees 20' W), Southern Brazil, covering two geomorphologic provinces: the Southern plateau and central depression. It is part of the Guaiba basin and has an area of approximately 800 km(2), encompassing 32 municipalities. The objective of this study was to monitor water quality in the Sinos River, the largest river in this basin. Water samples were collected at four selected sites in the Sinos River, and the following parameters were analysed: pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)), turbidity, fecal coliforms, total dissolved solids, temperature, nitrate, nitrite, phosphorous, chromium, lead, aluminum, zinc, iron, and copper. The results were analysed based on Resolution No. 357/2005 of the Brazilian National Environmental Council (CONAMA) regarding regulatory limits for residues in water. A second analysis was performed based on a water quality index (WQI) used by the Sinos River Basin Management Committee (COMITESINOS). Poor water quality in the Sinos River presents a worrying scenario for the region, since this river is the main source of water supply for the urban core. Health conditions found in the Sinos River, mainly in its lower reaches, are worrying and a strong indicator of human activities on the basin.

AB  - Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant widely used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here we report a novel paradigm that affords inferences about habituation and attention to a novel stimulus in a familiar environment in a single test session without prior training of the animals. The paradigm was used to assess the effects of methylphenidate (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, sc) in young adult, male. Long-Evans rats. Methylphenidate increased locomotor activity during the initial exposure to the test apparatus in a non-dose-related manner. However, upon introduction of a novel spatial stimulus (an alcove) in the familiar environment, methylphenidate-treatment resulted in dose-related increases in distance traveled and inhibition of long dwell times in the alcove, the latter behavior being characteristic of vehicle-treated rats' response to the alcove condition. These results demonstrate the utility of this paradigm in the elucidation of the behavioral effects of a drug commonly used in the treatment of ADHD. Findings also suggest that species-typical response preferences in rats (e.g., refuge-seeking) may emerge in experimental settings that add spatial novelty to otherwise featureless test enclosures commonly used to assess locomotor activity.

AB  - A laboratory study was conducted to assess the impacts of diazinon, linuron or a fungicidal preparation of mancozeb supplemented with dimethomorph on dehydrogenase activity (DHA) in loamy sand (LS) and sandy loam (SL) soils with different features. The pesticides were applied at the maximum predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) under field conditions and at 5 or 100 times the PEC. More distinct effects were observed in LS than SL soils at all sampling times. For PEC, a significant decrease in DHA was found in LS soil treated with diazinon or the fungicidal preparation on day 1 and during the incubation period, respectively. However, DHA did not decrease in SL soil treated with the pesticides at this dosage. For the higher concentrations, decreased DHA was ascertained in LS soil treated with diazinon and the fungicidal preparation at all sampling times, whereas for linuron this effect was evident on days 14 and 28. By contrast, only 100-fold PEC significantly decreased DHA in SL soil amended with diazinon or linuron, compared with the fungicidal preparation that decreased DHA at five-fold PEC. Our results indicate that DHA was particularly sensitive to the fungicidal preparation in both soils, whereas linuron was less harmful than diazinon.

AB  - Acidic, metal-stressed conditions encountered in the acid sulfate soils significantly inhibited the growth of Corymbia citriodora var.variegata, possibly due to the reduced rate of photosynthesis and plant root activity. However, the plant's self-protection mechanism to counteract stress-induced cellular damage by reactive oxygen species still functioned well even at a soil pH as low as 2.81. This may explain the high tolerance of this plant species to the extremely acidic environments. The observed phytotoxicity symptoms were not accompanied by elevated concentrations of heavy metals in the plant tissues, suggesting that heavy metal levels in plant tissue alone are not valid indications of phyrotoxicity to the tested plant species. Leachates from the acid sulfate soils had strong toxicity to Daphnia carinata. Median lethal dilution factor (LDF50) was much higher for the leachate from the highly acidic acid sulfate soils (ASS) than that from the mildly acidic ASS. Although the concentration of various metals markedly decreased with increasing number of leaching cycle, leachate toxicity to Daphnia carinata did not decrease accordingly. This suggests that levels of heavy metals and Al in the leachate are not good indicators of the mine water biotoxicity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study simulates the internalization of the external costs of major global environmental issues using an optimal economic growth model. We merged two existing models: an integrated assessment model (IAM) and a life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) model. We sought to achieve simultaneously the following three objectives: (i) to incorporate environmental issues including global warming in the IAM; (ii) to assess environmental impacts with a bottom-up approach from the LCIA; and (iii) to internalize external costs obtained from the environmental impact study. The study also provides initial simulation results obtained from the merged model.
   Simulation results indicate that global warming will account for somewhere from 10% to 40% of all external costs in the 21st century. The remaining cost will come from land use and its changes. The internalization of the external cost will cause a decline in economic growth by approximately 5%, whereas forest preservation will increase by 40% and fossil-fuel consumption will be reduced by 15%. The estimated sustainability indicators imply that a necessary condition of sustainable development is satisfied for the entire world and for the developed countries during the 21st century, but is not satisfied until the latter half of this century for the developing counties.

AB  - Birds need to acquire carotenoids for their feather pigmentation from their diet, which means that their plumage color may change as a consequence of human impact on their environment. For example, the carotenoid-based plumage coloration of Great tit, Parus major, nestlings is associated with the degree of environmental pollution. Breast feathers of birds in territories exposed to heavy metals are less yellow than those in unpolluted environments. Here we tested two hypotheses that could explain the observed pattern: (I) deficiency of carotenoids in diet, and (II) pollution-related changes in transfer of carotenoids to feathers. We manipulated dietary carotenoid levels of nestlings and measured the responses in plumage color and tissue concentrations. Our carotenoid supplementation produced the same response in tissue carotenoid concentrations and plumage color in polluted and unpolluted environments. Variation in heavy metal levels did not explain the variation in tissue (yolk, plasma, and feathers) carotenoid concentrations and was not related to plumage coloration. Instead, the variation in plumage yellowness was associated with the availability of carotenoid-rich caterpillars in territories. Our results support the hypothesis that the primary reason for pollution-related variation in plumage color is carotenoid deficiency in the diet.

AB  - Recent studies show great opportunities in food industry for antimicrobial activity of plant extracts on some pathogenic microorganisms. Plant extracts are used in food processing technologies as natural additives substituting synthetic products. The research subject was to obtain alcoholic, hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts from Ocimum basilicum, Satureja hortensis and Anethum graveolens, and then these samples were thermally treated to imitate the conservation conditions for food products. Pathogenic microorganisms were Escherichia coli, Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus cricetus and Candida albicans and the evaluation indicator for antimicrobial activity was the inhibitory zone diameter. The results showed a resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus cricetus for all aqueous extracts, except Satureja hortensis aqueous extract for Streptococcus cricetus, irrespective of the temperature used for extract concentration. Aqueous extract of Ocimum basilicum evaporated to 100 degrees C did not affect the culture of Candida albicans. The largest diameter of the inhibition zone was observed in the case of Ocimum basilicum aqueous extract evaporated at 80 degrees C for Escherichia coli, Satureja hortensis alcoholic extract for Staphylococcus aureus, Satureja hortensis aqueous extract evaporated at 80 degrees C for Streptococcus cricetus, Ocimum basilicum alcoholic extract for Streptococcus cricetus and Satureja hortensis and Ocimum basilicum alcoholic extracts for Candida albicans. The other extracts indicated an average inhibitory zone diameter for tested pathogenic microorganisms.

AB  - We have developed a confocal fluorescence microscope for observation of the dissolution kinetics at various crystal faces under varying conditions. Natural calcite (CaCO3) was chosen for the experimental samples and the dissolution kinetics was estimated from the increase in the pH value of the solution using a fluorescent pH indicator, seminaphthorhodafluors-1. Using this instrument, we investigated not only the difference in dissolution rate among various crystal faces but also the effects of the surface toughness, subsurface structure (such as lattice defects) and inhibitor on the dissolution rate. Among the (1 0 (1) over bar 4), (1 0 (1) over bar 0) and (2 1 (1) over bar 4) faces of calcite samples, the (1 0 (1) over bar 4) face dissolved most slowly and the (1 0 (1) over bar 0) face fastest. Increasing the surface area of (1 0 (1) over bar 4)-face in contact with water by scratching increased the dissolution rate. Introduction of lattice defects on the (10 14) face by He+ irradiation significantly increased the dissolution rate. Inhibition of the calcite dissolution by La3+ occurred in the order of (10 T 4) > (1 0 (1) over tilde 0) > (2 1 (3) over bar 4). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The deep basinal euxinic sediments of the Black Sea are enriched in iron that is highly susceptible to sulfidization compared to oxic/suboxic continental margin sediments in the Black Sea and oxic/dysoxic continental margin and deep-sea sediments worldwide. A mass balance treatment of iron speciation data from three deep basin sediment cores shows that this enrichment is due to a combination of (1) highly reactive iron-bearing phases (sulfides and oxides) whose ultimate source was by diagenetic mobilization from the shelf (Wijsman and others, 2001) and (2) enhanced iron reactivity in the lithogenous component of deep basinal sediments. The cause of the enhanced reactivity of lithogenous iron is problematical. Possible mechanisms include microbial oxidation of non-reactive iron silicates and the preferential deposition of a fine-grained, reactive iron-enriched lithogenous component in the deep basin by the fractionation of the lithogenous flux during transport across the shelf. The application of paleoredox indicators based on iron reactivity (Degree of Pyritization, Indicator of Anoxicity) should take into account that the availability of highly reactive iron, and hence the concentration of reactive iron phases in the sediment, is controlled by a variety of chemical, physical and biological factors, some of which are not related directly to redox conditions in the water column.

AB  - In simulation models for water movement and nutrient transport, uptake of water and nutrients by roots forms an essential part. As roots are spatially distributed, prediction of root growth and root distribution is crucial for modelling water and nutrient uptake. In a preceding paper, De Willigen et al. ( 2002; Plant and Soil 240, 225 234) presented an analytical solution for describing root length density distribution as a diffusion-type process. In the current paper, we present a numerical model that does the same, but which is more flexible with respect to where root input can occur. We show that the diffusion-type root growth model can describe well observed rooting patterns. We used rooting patterns for different types of crops: maize, gladiolus, eastern white cedar, and tomato. For maize, we used data for two different types of fertiliser application: broadcast and row application. In case of row application, roots extend more vertically than horizontally with respect to the broadcast application situation. This is reflected in a larger ratio of diffusion coefficients in vertical versus horizontal direction. For tomato, we considered tomatoes grown on an artificial rooting medium, i.e. rockwool. We have shown that, in principle, the model can be extended by including reduction functions on the diffusion coefficient in order to account for environmental conditions.

AB  - The survival was determined in different conservation conditions of: somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA bacteriophages and phages infecting Bacteroides fragilis proposed as model micro-organisms for water quality control. Titres of phages of all groups either in pure culture phage suspensions or in naturally occurring phage suspensions were stable at (-70+/-10) degreesC and at (-20+/-5) degreesC when protected with glycerol. Moreover, phage analysis of stored suspensions demonstrated that their numbers were homogeneous, both between vials and within vials, and consequently they can be used as reference materials. Furthermore, changes in the storage temperature of the vials cause unpredictable changes in the numbers of bacteriophages. Consequently, phage reference materials and samples containing a quantitative number of phages must be maintained and dispatched at a constant temperature. Consequently, the results indicate that bacteriophages should be packed in dry ice during transport and storage. Finally, the number of phages in water samples stored at (5+/-3) degreesC in the dark does not decrease significantly during the first 72 h of storage. In addition, phage concentrates from natural samples obtained by adsorption-elution to cellulose nitrate filters and mixed with 10% glycerol were stable at least for 2 months at (-70+/-10) degreesC and at (-20+/-5) degreesC.

AB  - The self-cycling fermentation (SCF) technique for cell cultivation is a useful tool for studying microorganisms. To date, this method has only been applied to aerobic systems, since dissolved oxygen has been used exclusively as the feedback control parameter, which defines this technique. To extend the range of redox environments to which the SCF can be applied, an alternate measurement is required. Transient oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and carbon dioxide evolution were screened as potential feedback control parameters in a denitrifying system. The characteristic change in slope of the transient ORP profile commonly referred to as the "nitrate break point" was found to be a useful indicator of complete removal of oxidized nitrogen only in the presence of significant quantities of nitrate. An inflection point occurring after the break point was found to be a more general indicator of oxidized nitrogen removal. A control strategy based upon real-time detection of the inflection point was found to result in robust operation of the SCF. When variable amounts of nitrate (0-930 mg L-1) and nitrite (0-300 mg L-1) were added to the reactor each cycle, the control strategy automatically adjusted the cycle time, resulting in an effluent containing less than 1 mg L-1 of each of the oxidized nitrogen species.

AB  - The trace metal (Cu, Zn, Cd, Mn) and phytochelatin (an intracellular chelator for metal ions) cellular content were determined in phytoplankton samples originating from four lakes (Greifen, Sempach, Lucerne, and Orta). The lakes differ in their metal concentrations and in other conditions (pH, trophic state, organic matter). Total and intracellular contents of Cu and Cd were related to the experimentally determined free metal ion concentration and the total and intracellular content of Mn to the dissolved Mn. The intracellular Zn content was tightly regulated over a broad range of [Zn2+]. Phytochelatin concentrations were measurable in phytoplankton communities from three of the lakes, in spite of low levels of free Cu, Zn, and Cd ion concentrations. Culture experiments showed that the concentration of intracellular phytochelatin in Scenedesmus subspicatus and in a natural algal community increased upon addition of copper in a similar concentration range as in the lakes. Phytochelatin concentrations were below detection in the phytoplankton collected from the highly contaminated Lake Orta, perhaps suggesting that this algal community has adapted in some other way to high metal concentrations. Although we only sampled a few lakes, the lack of any clear relationship between phytochelatin and metal concentrations calls into question the feasibility of using phytochelatins as a bioindicator of metal exposure in lakes.

AB  - The sedimentary organic matter content of a series of 2-m-deep cores was investigated along a sea-land transect at five sites representing five species of mangrove and salt-marsh vegetation. The vegetation was settled at the same place for at least 1000 years and therefore sedimentary organic matter deriving from the decay of higher plants has accumulated in large amounts. The global morphological and chemical preservation of the organic matter attested by various sedimentary parameters, including the proportions of cellulose-bearing tissues, the TOC contents, the C/N ratios, the total sulphur contents and the delta(13)C compositions, reveals that the sedimentary organic matter is less degraded when it has been under the influence of the marine water table for a long time. This is indicated by a good correlation between the salinities of interstitial waters, the redox potentials measured in the wet sediments and the chemical composition of the organic matter. Moreover, the concentration of organic sulphur shows a positive correlation with the hydrogen index (HI), only under the marine water-table influence, suggesting the very local presence of sulphur-HC compounds.

AB  - In gulls, egg size and clutch asymmetry have been suggested to be suitable variables for assessing individual quality. Skuas, like several other seabirds, generally display within-clutch asymmetry (the second egg in the clutch is, on average, smaller than the first egg). We found no relationship between clutch volume in 2-egg clutches and laying date, hatching success or fledging production of pairs of Great Skuas (Catharacta skua) breeding in Shetland. There was a high repeatability (0.72, P < 0.0001) in the volume of clutches laid by the same pairs in consecutive years. The influence of adult age on egg size was weak and variable. Unlike clutch volume, clutch asymmetry was not repeatable and showed no relationship with adult age. Futhermore, clutch asymmetry did not correlate with any other breeding parameter. We conclude that, in Great Skuas, clutch characteristics are not suitable indicators of individual quality or environmental conditions over the range prevailing during this study. The results are discussed in comparison with the conclusions from studies with gulls, and it is argued that more research is needed to clarify the factors that are responsible for the existence of within-clutch asymmetry in seabirds.

AB  - Polychaetes Annelids are characterized by the presence of lateral parapodia located at the boundary of the dorsal and ventral sectors. In Nereidae, the rules for tissular conditions governing the induction of a supernumerary parapodium allow to consider the parapodia as reliable indicators of the dorsoventral polarity. In Nereis pelagica, evidence was given experimentally of a control by the nerve cord of the dorsoventral polarity during caudal regeneration:
   - During normal regeneration, the dorsoventral polarity is naturally restored.
   - In absence of nerve cord, a regenerate with a small size, segmented but incomplete and termed aneurogenic is formed. Devoid of ventral structures (nerve cord, ventral longitudinal musculature, nephridia), its completely dorsal nature was experimentally demonstrated.
   - In presence of a nerve cord grafted dorsally, a supernumerary territory of a ventral type forms in the dorsal sector of the regenerate.
   To conclude, zones regenerated in presence of nerve cord adopt a ventral positional value, zones out or distant of its influence adopt a dorsal positional value. Expression of the ventral positional value is realized only in the course of a regenerating process. Thus, regardless of the nature (dorsal or ventral) of the stump tissues, regenerating tissues can be reprogrammed during the differentiation of the regenerate in a dorsal or a ventral direction according as the nerve cord participates or not to their formation.

TI  - A VISUAL INDICATOR FOR HARVEST OF IMMATURE VIABLE SEED OF INDETERMINATE SOYBEAN GENOTYPES
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO
LA  - English
AB  - Harvest of immature soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed is used in breeding nurseries to reduce generation length. Individual pods are harvested and usually dried intact at ambient conditions. Number of days after flowering (DAF) has been shown to be a good criterion to determine the appropriate time to harvest, but the method is time consuming on a large number of genotypes. The objective of this study was to identify a visual indicator of the appropriate stage for harvest of immature viable seeds. Two indeterminate cultivars, Lakota from Maturity Group (MG) I and BSR 301 from MG III, were planted in three environments at Isabela, PR. Harvest of pods began 28 DAF and continued every 3 days until 46 DAF. Field emergence, fresh and dry seed weights, seed width, seed length, seed thickness, pod angle, pod color and reproductive stage of individual plants were recorded. Results pointed out that the best visual indicator for the harvest of immature seed obtained from green pods was a combination of pod angle, seed dimensions, and reproductive stage of the plant. In general, field emergences of 70% or better were obtained with immature seed of green pods that could be bent no more than 30-degrees before rupturing and that contained seeds at or near their maximum width, length, and thickness. These pods were harvested from plants that had reached reproductive stage R6.

AB  - This paper presents results from a field survey of living molluscan communities and associated (sub)fossil life and death assemblages found on the modern braided river floodplain of the River Lech, in northern Austria.  The study was undertaken in order to throw light on the taphonomy of molluscs in present-day braided river environments, as a basis for understanding in more detail the origins and significance of some of the fossil assemblages commonly found in Quaternary braided river deposits in lowland Britain.  The field data suggest that different types of (sub)fossil molluscan life and death assemblage tend to accumulate in distinct depositional environments on the braided floodplain.  Variations in the sub-fossil assemblages (e.g. in the numbers of species found, the patterns of breakage and the numbers of individuals) seem to reflect variations in the immediate character of the local depositional environment and the post-mortem history of the shells, rather than changes in general climatic conditions.  It is suggested that considerable care is needed in using the evidence from Quaternary molluscan faunas obtained from braided rivers as indicators of past regional vegetation and climate, unless there is a clear understanding of the characteristics of the diverse local depositional environments, the taphonomic processes operating within them, and the lifecycles and ecologies of the molluscs involved.

AB  - Vibration is an indicator of performance degradation or operational safety issues of mobile cleaning robots. Therefore, predicting the source of vibration at an early stage will help to avoid functional losses and hazardous operational environments. This work presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled predictive maintenance framework for mobile cleaning robots to identify performance degradation and operational safety issues through vibration signals. A four-layer 1D CNN framework was developed and trained with a vibration signals dataset generated from the in-house developed autonomous steam mopping robot 'Snail' with different health conditions and hazardous operational environments. The vibration signals were collected using an IMU sensor and categorized into five classes: normal operational vibration, hazardous terrain induced vibration, collision-induced vibration, loose assembly induced vibration, and structure imbalanced vibration signals. The performance of the trained predictive maintenance framework was evaluated with various real-time field trials with statistical measurement metrics. The experiment results indicate that our proposed predictive maintenance framework has accurately predicted the performance degradation and operational safety issues by analyzing the vibration signal patterns raised from the cleaning robot on different test scenarios. Finally, a predictive maintenance map was generated by fusing the vibration signal class on the cartographer SLAM algorithm-generated 2D environment map.

AB  - Desalination is increasingly becoming an integral part of water management strategies of several countries worldwide. However, it causes environmental impacts that need to be further assessed. This includes the disposure of end-of-life reverse osmosis (RO) elements. Hence, this work proposes a methodology to estimate and forecast the disposure of these elements without fixing the membrane lifespan. To this, a time-step model was applied for the first and the ARIMA model was used for the latter. It was possible to estimate a generation of 900 t from 2016 to 2019 in Brazil and forecast a generation of 1800 t by 2024. In addition, to define RO industrial use in Brazil as supplied by 8-inch only elements have proved to be a good approximation (2% deviation). Furthermore, the disposure rate (in elements/m(3).day) of EoL-RO elements in Brazil was found as double as countries such as Spain and Australia. This indicates that operation conditions should be improved and/or that membranes are being discarded before time. Such results are important to subsidize further environmental impact assessment regarding EoL-RO in Brazil and improve production management. Finally, the proposed methodology can be easily applied to other countries whose membranes are mostly imported, as the case of developing countries.

AB  - Ecological restoration projects aim to restore native vegetation, and monitoring is an essential step in evaluating the applied technique. The construction of the Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Parana River, between the states of Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil), in the 1960s, left behind extensive degraded areas, known as "borrowed areas" and characterized by the removal of the vegetation and superficial soil horizons. The experimental field is located on the Farm of UNESP / Ilha Solteira Campus, in the municipality of Selviria-MS. Residues were incorporated into the subsoil as conditioners. The residues, aquatic macrophytes (0, 16, and 32 t ha(-1)) and sugarcane bagasse ash (0, 15, 30 and 45 t ha(-1)), were combined in 12 treatments and 1080 seedlings (10 different Cerrado tree species) were planted in the study area. The objective of this work was to evaluate the induction of revegetation, established 5 years previously, through the ecological indicators: Soil cover with native vegetation (CSVN); density of native regenerating individuals (DINR) and number of native regenerating species (NENR). Based on the indicators, the results show that the addition of residues and planting of the seedlings were efficient for the ecological recovery of the studied area, with the highest doses of macrophyte yielding the best recovery rates.

AB  - Assessing the effects of cover crops on soil health under real-world conditions requires a comprehensive dataset. A farmer-led trial on 1,522 strip-years from 78 farms across 9 US states over 5 years reveals improvements in key soil indicators, with active carbon concentration responding the most rapidly.
   Cover crops are touted for their potential agronomic and environmental benefits, and are currently incentivized through state, federal and private investment in the USA. There is a need to quantify the impact of on-farm use of cover crops at spatial (2-5 years) and temporal (regional-to-national) scales aligned with such investment programmes. Here we report soil health data from a farmer-led trial of cover crops on 1,522 strip-years, from 78 farms across 9 US states over 5 years. We found that up to 5 years of cover crop use had small but increasing impacts on four of six selected soil health indicators, with active carbon concentration responding the most rapidly. Soil texture, the length of time a field was in the trial and a farm-level random effect were also strongly related to soil health properties. Our results fit with evidence from controlled trials and suggest that the use of cover crops can begin to influence soil health within several years after adoption.

AB  - This review summarises current knowledge of the relationship between heat stress (I-IS) and reproduction in cattle. It focuses on research from the viewpoint of genetics (breed), from the viewpoint of reproduction physiology (in vivo and in vitro) and from the animal husbandry practice. From the viewpoint of animal husbandry, it was evidenced that heat stress influences reproduction before, during and after conception. Most publications suggest the negative impact of heat stress on the reproductive physiology of cows reflected in ovarian and follicular activity, in oocyte and embryo development, as well as in other processes studied under in vivo or in vitro conditions. There are also a number of products that the cell creates in response to heat stress, which is used as indicators of the stress (e.g. heat shock proteins). A number of publications also focus on how to prevent heat stress on the farm (e.g. shade, water shower) or during in vitro procedures, including the supplementation of the culture media with antioxidants like melatonin. Research of heat stress is very important in cattle breeding for preventing and reducing its effects on the farm and also in the context of climate changes and global atmospheric warming.

AB  - Pinus sylvestris var. sylvestriformis is an endemic plant in Changbai Mountain area of China. Five different light levels were simulated and designed with control experiments: full sunlight (CK), light shading (light transmittance was 10%) (LA), light and moderate shading (light transmittance was 20%) (LB), moderate shading (light transmittance was 40%) (LC), and severe shading (light transmittance was 60%) (LD). The optimal light levels and the main physiological and ecological factors affecting photosynthesis in different growth stages were discussed. The results showed that the phenotypic index and photosynthetic physiological and ecological indicators were the highest when the light transmittance was 40%. In the early growth phase, the physiological factors intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and ecological factors transmittance (Tran) and air temperature (Temp) jointly affected the changes of net photosynthetic rate (P-n). In the peak growth phase, transpiration rate (T-r), air humidity (RH), and Tran had greater direct positive effects on P-n, and Ci and stomatal conductance (Gs) had direct negative effects on P-n. In the later growth phase, T-r and Ci had large direct positive effects on P-n. The research results could provide important references for the scientific cultivation and popularization of P. sylvestris var. sylvestriformis.

AB  - The Albian-Cenomanian strata of the Koppeh-Dagh Basin were investigated for their marine palynomorphs and palynofacies contents and used for palaeoclimatic, palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphical purposes. Various palynofacies criteria such as Palynological Marine Index (PMI), chorate/proximate, proximochorate and cavate ratio (C/PPC) and outer neritic/inner neritic index (ON/IN) were applied as alternative indicators to monitor the proximal-distal trends. Higher values of the former proxies versus low continental/marine ratio (CONT/MAR) were documented during periods of relative rise of sea-level. Increasing values of the marine palynological proxies such as the PMI, C/PPC and ON/IN were consistent with maximum flooding surfaces (MFS). A relatively diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblage was reported at MFS, whereas, during the periods of relative sea-level fall, the dinocyst diversity decreased and coincided with those above-mentioned marine palynological ratios that reinforced terrestrial conditions. Palaeovegetation reconstruction showed the predominance of the pteridophyte spores. This palynoflora indicates a humid and warm climate during the Albian-Cenomanian time. Three deducted depositional sequences correspond with those suggested in previous studies based on surface and subsurface geological data. Sea-level changes correspond well with those reported from other parts of the Tethys.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of quantitative and quality indicators of female prostitution in the cities of Perm province in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. Based on statistics from 1889 and 1909, features of the spread of prostitution both in large industrial cities and in small towns for the period under review are revealed. The author presents a social portrait of women involved in commercial sex - their age, social origin, the time they became prostitutes, education, economic status, etc. Attention is paid to the public opinion on the existence of prostitution in the cities of the Perm province. Possible reasons for the involvement in prostitution are examined, from the economic factor to the processes of emancipation of sexuality in the urban environment in the course of urbanization both in Russia as a whole and in the Perm province. The existence of illegal forms of prostitutions along with legal ones is assessed. The features of everyday life of women engaged in prostitution in the cities of the Perm province are characterized. The author considers their living conditions, places of residence, possible movements, and the contingent of their "clients". An assessment is given of how their daily life was affected by state laws, the purpose of which was both to maintain public order and healthcare.

AB  - Extraction of adamantanes and diamantanes from petroleum source rock using nonionic surfactant was investigated and the optimum conditions for yields of the diamondoids were determined. The conventionally used accelerated solvent extraction method was compared to an innovative microwaveassisted nonionic surfactant extraction (MANSE). A three-level full factorial design of experiment (DoE) was adopted for the optimization of MANSE, involving solvent concentration, extraction temperature as well as extraction time. In-tube extraction (ITEX-2) using TENAX TA as sorbent in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the diamondoids in the extract. The results revealed that solvent concentration, extraction temperature and time have significant effects on extraction yields of the diamondoids. 0.04 M was the optimum surfactant concentration for extraction of both, adamantane and diamantane. The highest yields of the diamondoids were obtained at extraction temperature of 80 degrees C. The optimum extraction time for both adamantane and diamantane was 10 min. In comparison with the accelerated solvent extraction method, the results showed that MANSE is more efficient. This study has revealed that MANSE is a robust and efficient environmentally benign sample preparation method for geochemical evaluation of petroleum source rock. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a method for reconstructing the wake wind field of a wind turbine based on planar light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scans crossing the wake transversally in the vertical and horizontal directions. Volumetric measurements enable the study of wake characteristics in these two directions. Due to a lack of highly resolved wind speed measurements as reference data, we evaluate the reconstruction in a synthetic environment and determine the reconstruction errors. The wake flow of a multi-megawatt wind turbine is calculated within a 10-min large-eddy simulation (LES) for high-thrust loading conditions. We apply a numerical LiDAR simulator to this wake wind field to achieve realistic one-dimensional velocity data. We perform a nacelle-based set-up with combined plan position indicator and range height indicator scans with eight scanning velocities each. We temporally up-sample the synthetic LiDAR data with a weighted combination of forward- and backward-oriented space-time conversion to retrospectively extract high-resolution wake characteristic dynamics. These dynamics are used to create a dynamic volumetric wake deficit. Finally, we reconstruct the dynamic wake wind field in three spatial dimensions by superposing an ambient wind field with the dynamic volumetric wake deficit. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wake field reconstruction using long-range LiDAR measurements.
