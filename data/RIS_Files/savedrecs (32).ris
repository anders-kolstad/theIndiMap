AB  - This paper revisits the roles of institutions and human capital in the development process by using structural equation modeling with a latent construct. Two models are constructed by using the data of 143 countries with 14 publicly available indicators; non-mediated (Model A) and mediated one (Model B). A path between institutional quality and economic development is identified in Model A and found as significant. When human capital is added into the Model B as a mediator, the direct relationship between institutional quality and economic development which is confirmed in Model A becomes insignificant. This evidence contributes to the debate by explaining the roles of institutions and human capital in the development process, based on the existing level of institutional quality that determines conditions on decisions for starting or sustaining the development process. In other words, (a) improving institutions in addition to human capital is needed for the countries with low level of institutional quality to start development process and; (b) on the other hand, since the human capital develops immunity on the quality of the institutions, human capital plays a more basic role to sustain the development process for the countries with a high level of institutional quality.

AB  - White lupine is a species with a great perspective among annual grain legumes. A biological and breeding evaluation of a collection of 23 white lupine cultivars regarding basic traits and indicators was conducted, with an aim to select suitable parental forms. The study was carried out at the Institute of Forage Crops Pleven, Bulgaria during the period 2014-2016. The cultivars differed in their habitus, duration of the growing season, productivity, biochemical seed composition and susceptibility to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lupini. The vegetation period in the Central Northern Bulgaria conditions varied from 129 days in Barde to 148 days in Nahrquell and Shienfield Gard. Dega, Desnyanskii and Barde can be characterized as early-ripening cultivars, and late-ripening ones were Nahrquell, Shienfield Gard and Bezimenii 1. The highest protein content showed Horizont, Bezimenii 2 and Solnechnii (32.7-33.3%), and a reaction of resistance to Fusarium oxysporum 1. sp. lupini was demonstrated by nine cultivars (Nahrquell, BGR 6305, WAT, Kijewskij Mutant, Pflugs Ultra, Termis Mestnii, Solnechnii, Pink Mutant, Dega). Particular interest from a breeding viewpoint represents Tel Keram, Termis Mestnii, Solnechnii and Pink Mutant which are distinguished by high values of seed weight per plant and a favourable combination of the other traits, recommending them to be included in breeding programs for development of high-yielding white lupine cultivars.

AB  - The paper introduces the idea of using Google Trends search query volumes for both economic and biodiversity-related terms and keywords as data source in order to produce a composite but simple indicator-early warning sign of public interest in conservation co-evolving with citizens' concerns about economy and unemployment. The behavior of this indicator is examined mainly in the context of the European Union Member States facing the effects of economic recession after the 2008 economic crisis. Four EuroArea Member States (Germany, Greece, Italy and The Netherlands) representing various facets of the combination of biodiversity and economy conditions are used as examples of the characteristics of this indicator, during a ten year period, extending equally before and after the eruption of economic crisis. Results indicate that such an indicator uncovers that public interest in biodiversity does decelerate worldwide, in the European Union and in the four studied cases; however, an explanation of this decreasing trend as being part of larger cycles in public interest that resonate with some hysteresis with cycles of economy offers a more promising view of the phenomenon. The hypothesis that public interest in biodiversity is driven by "animal spirits", according to Keynes' prediction is formulated and its significance regarding communication and strategy of conservation is debated.

AB  - It is a necessary but challenging task for creative producers to have an idea of the depth perception of the target audience when watching a stereoscopic film in a cinema during production. This paper proposes a novel metric, geometric perceived depth percentage (GPDP), to numerate and depict the depth perception of a scene before rendering. In addition to the geometric relationship between the object depth and focal distance, GPDP takes the screen width and viewing distance into account. As a result, it provides a more intuitive means for predicting stereoscopy and is universal across different viewing conditions. Based on GPDP, we design a practical tool to visualize the stereoscopic perception without the need for any 3-D device or special environment. The tool utilizes the stereoscopic comfort volume, GPDP-based shading schemes, depth perception markers, and GPDP histograms as visual cues so that animators can set stereoscopic parameters more easily. The tool is easily implemented in any modern rendering pipeline, including interactive Autodesk Maya and offline Pixar's RenderMan renderer. It has been used in several production projects including commercial ones. Finally, two user studies show that GPDP is a proper depth perception indicator and the proposed tool can make the stereoscopic parameter setting process easier and more efficient.

AB  - The variations of environmental conditions (T degrees C, pH, delta C-13, delta O-18, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca) for two ostracod species (Psychrodromus olivaceus, Potamocypris similis) were analyzed and compared to identify the controls of environmental parameters on the chemical and isotopic composition of their valves. The specimens were collected from Karapinar Spring (Bolu, Turkey) between October 2009 and November 2010. The species were observed throughout the year. Psychrodromus olivaceus showed relatively constant Mg/Ca ratios during the study period, whereas those of P. similis showed more variability. The ratio was also significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two species. We did not find significant correlation between water temperature and either of the species' Mg/Ca ratios. The stable isotope record for P. similis was very patchy, showing a small range of values consistent with the groundwater source, similar to the behavior of Sr/Ca. The Sr/Ca ratio displayed little variation throughout the year, suggesting hydrochemical stability over time, most likely in response to the groundwater source. The stable isotope data displayed pronounced variability for P. similis but little for P. olivaceus, suggesting that the former may be responding to seasonality, whereas the latter responds to groundwater.

AB  - The knowledge of the correct morphological and biochemical parameters in mute swans is an important indicator of their health status, body condition, adaptation to habitat and useful diagnostic tools in veterinary practice and ecological research. The aim of the study was to obtain hematological parameters in relation to age, sex and serum biochemistry values in wild-living mute swans. We found the significant differences in the erythrocyte count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in relation to age of mute swans. There were no differences in hematological values between males and females. The leukogramand H/L ratio did not vary by age and sex in swans. Among of biochemical parameters the slightly increased AST, ALP, CK, K, urea, decreased CHOL and TG values were recorded. As far as we know, this is the first study in which the morphometric parameters of blood cells in mute swans were presented. We found extremely low concentration of lead in blood (at subtreshold level). No blood parasites were found in blood smears. The analysis of body mass and biometric parameters revealed a significant differences dependent on age and sex. No differences in the scaled mass index were found. Our results represent a normal hematologic and blood chemistry values and age-sex related changes, as reference values for the mute swan.

AB  - The Monterey pine aphid, Essigella californica Essig (Hemiptera: Aphididae), was first detected in Australia in 1998 and is now a major damaging agent in Pinus radiata plantations throughout south-eastern Australia. Tree-level crown damage was visually assessed over four years, from 2006 to 2009, in 120 plots located in Green Hills State Forest (Hume Region, Forests NSW). The plots represented 30 tree-age classes and a range of related stocking densities. We applied random forests and linear mixed modelling (ASReml) to examine the relationships between crown damage and a series of silvicultural and local climatic and terrain attributes. Consistent with previous observations, our results showed that crown damage due to E. californica is highly variable and is influenced by a suite of interacting and confounding factors. We identified prevailing climatic conditions, stand age and tree genotype as being the most influential, as well as threshold values associated with these relationships. These predictor variables can be used to stratify plantation planning units according to risk of defoliation by E. californica and for prioritising and targeting management activities such as aerial surveillance, release of the introduced biological control agent Diaeretus essigellae, possible late-age fertiliser application and in the future, the deployment of Essigella-resistant pine genotypes.

AB  - Mountain stream monitoring is closely related to the survey of bryophyte species since it is there that these organisms are common and show very specialized ecological niches. This work hypothesizes that a close relationship between bryophyte taxonomic and functional categories and microhabitat conditions exists and proposes to explore this link as a basis for fine-scale monitoring.
   The distribution of bryophytes in mountain fluvial microhabitats of northwest and centre-west Portugal was examined at 165 locations. The response of higher level taxonomic groups and life forms and strategies categories along fine-scale hydromorphologic gradients in mountain streambeds was evaluated through multivariate statistical analysis and models.
   Frequency and abundance patterns suggested that species taxonomic groups and life forms and strategies categories distribution are mostly determined by the same microhabitat variables: water velocity, local light incidence and hydrologic zone in the streambed. Additionally, the distribution trends of each category are presented in graphic models summarizing the habitat segregation of bryophyte traits. The specificity of bryophyte distribution patterns were calibrated in undisturbed mountain watercourse to explore their use in monitoring fine-scale variation of flow and light regimes caused by anthropic influence.

AB  - Hydrolysis is one of the most common reactions controlling abiotic degradation and is one of the main paths by which substances are degraded in the environment. Nevertheless, the available information on this process for many compounds, including sulphonamides (a group of antibiotic drugs widely used in veterinary medicine), is very limited. This is the first study investigating the hydrolytic stabilities of 12 sulphonamides, which were determined according to OECD guideline 111 (1st category reliability data on the basis of regulatory demands on data quality for the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals). Hydrolysis behaviour was examined at pH values normally found in the environment. This was prefaced by a discussion of the acid-base properties of sulphonamides. All the sulphonamides tested were hydrolytically stable at pH 9.0, nine (apart from sulphadiazine, sulphachloropyridazine and sulphamethoxypyridazine) were stable in this respect at pH 7.0 and two (sulphadiazine and sulphaguanidine) at pH 4.0 (hydrolysis rate <= 10%; t(0.5(25 degrees c)) > 1 year). The degradation products were identified, indicating two independent mechanisms of this process. Our results show that under typical environmental conditions (pH and temperature) sulphonamides are hydrolytically stable with a long half-life; they thus contribute to the on-going assessment of their environmental fate.

AB  - This study uses a site-specific life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental profile and energy and water demand of potential production options for rapeseed biodiesel in Chile. The first step is the analysis of the biodiesel supply chain in a standard scenario, associated with the most likely production conditions. The second step is the evaluation of the following alternative scenarios related to a production strategy involving low-impact or renewable resources: (1) Addition of livestock manure as organic fertilizer, (2) Use of degraded grassland, (3) Biodiesel transport by rail, and (4) Use of forest residues for industrial steam. The results show that the biodiesel in the standard scenario has less environmental impacts than fossil diesel in 4 of the 13 indicators evaluated. The rapeseed production is the stage with the highest contribution to impacts. The scenario 1 presents the best environmental profile. The scenario 2 reduces the greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel. The scenarios 3 and 4 moderately improve the profile of the biofuel. The four situations could be implemented in the short term, but should be backed up by economic and social studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper introduces an innovative modelling strategy aimed at simulating the main terms of net forest carbon budget (net primary production, NPP and net ecosystem exchange, NEE) in Tuscany (Central Italy). The strategy is based on the preliminary calibration and application of parametric and bio-geochemical models (C-Fix and BIOME-BGC, respectively), which simulate the behaviour of forest ecosystems close to equilibrium condition (climax). Next, the ratio of actual over-potential tree volume is computed as an indicator of ecosystem distance from climax and is combined with the model outputs to estimate the NPP and NEE of real forests. The per-pixel application of the new modelling strategy was made possible by the collection of several data layers (maps of forest type and volume, daily meteorological data and monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images for the years 1999-2003) which served to characterize the eco-climatic and forest features of the region. The obtained estimates of forest NPP and NEE were evaluated against ground measurements of accumulated woody biomass and net carbon exchange. The results of these experiments testify the good potential of the proposed strategy and indicate some problem areas which should be the subject of future research.

AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the most widely used model organisms in plant sciences. Because of the increasing knowledge in the understanding of its molecular pathways, a reproducible and stable growth set-up for obtaining uniform plants becomes more important. In order to be able to easily harvest and study both roots and shoots, and to allow simple exposure to water-soluble toxic substances, a hydroponic system is the desired cultivation method for controlled plant growth. Based on earlier developed hydroponic cultivation protocols, a hydroponic set-up was optimized and statistically validated using linear mixed-effects models. In order to determine important components that influence the level of variability in a hydroponic set-up, stress-related indicators were examined at the biochemical as well as at the molecular level. It is highly recommended that statistical as well as biological assumptions are carried out before post-analyses are performed. Therefore, we suggest a model where factors that influence variability such as the usage of different pots and harvesting on different times are taken into account in the analyses. Furthermore. in contrast to what has been reported in earlier studies, our findings indicate that continuous aeration of the hydroponic solution is highly important. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - This study aimed to determine whether the waste management systems, that are presently applied in affluent countries are appropriate solutions for waste management in less developed regions. For this purpose, three cities (Vienna, Damascus and Dhaka) which differ greatly in their gross domestic product and waste management were compared. The criteria for evaluation were economic parameters, and indicators as to whether the goals of waste management (protection of human health and the environment, the conservation of resources) were reached. Based on case studies, it was found that for regions spending 1-10 Euro capital year(-1) for waste management, the 'waste hierarchy' of prevention, recycling and disposal is not an appropriate strategy. In such regions, the improvement of disposal systems (complete collection, upgrading to sanitary landfilling) is the most cost-effective method to reach the objectives of solid waste management. Concepts that are widely applied in developed countries such as incineration and mechanical waste treatment are not suitable methods to reach waste management goals in countries where people cannot spend more than 10 Euro per person for the collection, treatment and disposal of their waste. It is recommended that each region first determines its economic capacity for waste management and then designs its waste management system according to this capacity and the goals of waste management.

AB  - A magnetic signature of tree rings was tested as a potential paleo-climatic indicator. We examined wood from sequoia tree, located in Mountain Home State Forest, California, whose tree ring record spans over the period 600 - 1700 A. D. We measured low and high-field magnetic susceptibility, the natural remanent magnetization ( NRM), saturation isothermal remanent magnetization ( SIRM), and stability against thermal and alternating field ( AF) demagnetization. Magnetic investigation of the 200 mm long sequoia material suggests that magnetic efficiency of natural remanence may be a sensitive paleoclimate indicator because it is substantially higher ( in average > 1%) during the Medieval Warm Epoch ( 700 - 1300 A. D.) than during the Little Ice Age ( 1300 - 1850 A. D.) where it is < 1%. Diamagnetic behavior has been noted to be prevalent in regions with higher tree ring density. The mineralogical nature of the remanence carrier was not directly detected but maghemite is suggested due to low coercivity and absence of Verwey transition. Tree ring density, along with the wood's magnetic remanence efficiency, records the Little Ice Age ( LIA) well documented in Europe. Such a record suggests that the European LIA was a global phenomenon. Magnetic analysis of the thermal stability reveals the blocking temperatures near 200 degree C. This phenomenon suggests that the remanent component in this tree may be thermal in origin and was controlled by local thermal condition.

AB  - Studies comparing the performance of organic versus conventional farming systems have often demonstrated the superiority of organic systems in terms of nitrate leaching and energy efficiency. Little is known, however, about the relative performance of organic arable systems on high-quality soils and under favourable agricultural conditions. Against this backdrop, field trials were conducted on the Lindhof, the experimental research farm for organic agriculture an extensive land use systems of the University of Kiel, over a period of three years during which organic and conventional farming systems were run in parallel. The performance of both systems was measured using a set of agronomic, economic and ecological indicators, including yields, gross margins, nitrate leaching, energy usage and energy efficiency. A conventional rotation comprising oilseed rape - winter wheat - sugar beet - winter wheat was compared with two organic rotations, with 33 % and 50 % legumes, respectively. The results differ from the findings of other studies to the extent that the organic rotations performed less well than the conventional rotation with respect to the indicators of abiotic resource conservation. We demonstrate that the farm type (specialised arable versus mixed) has a decisive impact on the results. We conclude that a comprehensive assessment of land use systems at both the regional and the farm-level is needed to legitimate incentive payments for the adoption of organic farming methods.

AB  - Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Counter) plants were grown in 12 L polyethylene containers in aerated nutrient solutions containing equal nutrient ratios at increasing concentrations (X1 = standard concentration, and X3, X5.5, X8 or X11 = 3, 5.5, 8 or 11 times the standard concentration). Fruit yield decreased significantly from moderate (X3) to high (X11) nutrient concentration during summer, but remained nearly unaffected by the strength of the nutrient solution under low-radiation conditions in autumn. This stress-induced difference in yield was reflected by higher proline concentrations in leaves of plants grown during the summer compared to those grown during the late season. The decrease in fruit fresh and dry weight observed in summer was due to reduced availability of water and the distribution of dry matter towards the vegetative plant parts at the expense of reproductive growth. The proline content of tomato leaves fluctuated according to nutrient concentration and total radiation, and was closely related to the relative water content of leaves. It was concluded that proline is a reliable indicator of the environmental stress imposed on plants, thus allowing us to establish stress thresholds for fruit yield and product quality of hydroponically grown tomato.

AB  - The ectoparasitoid Aphytis melinus initially selects its host, California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (Homoptera: Diaspididae), using characteristics of the host's cover before assessing the quality of the scale body beneath. Host suitability is known to increase with host size until the scale insect reaches maturity, after which it is no longer available for parasitism. The wasp uses a combination of scare cover size and a kairomone, O-caffeoyltyrosine, in the covet-for initial assessment. Under natural conditions these two factors are frequently coupled. We quantified the relative importance of cover size and kairomone concentration independently by removing and selectively reapplying controlled doses of synthetic O-caffeoyltyrosine to scale covers of known size. In the absence of the kairomone, wasps did not discriminate among scale covers differing in size. Wasps showed a curvilinear response to kairomone dose for each scale cover age group. Wasps preferred low doses of O-caffeoyltyrosine on young, small scale covers, and high doses on old, large scale covers. The ability of wasps to respond quantitatively to the kairomone may be used in the field to differentiate small second-instar from larger and mole suitable third-instar scale insect larvae.

AB  - The effects of gaseous air pollutants on the moss-dwelling aquatic fauna were studied along an urban-rural gradient in the region of Zurich (Switzerland). Moss samples from 12 study sites, representing different air quality conditions, were taken in October 1984. Close to 49'000 individuals were extracted. Nematodes and tardigrades were analysed to species level; rotifers were treated as a group. Community structure (species composition and abundance) was related to air pollution. The abundance of nematodes increased with increasing air pollution, while species richness was not significantly affected. In contrast, the number of tardigrade species decreased with increasing levels of SO2. The abundance of tardigrades and rotifers varied independently of SO2 and NO2. Classification and ordination techniques were used to investigate the similarity between samples or study sites based on environmental characteristics, pollution, flora and fauna. Results suggest that air pollution represents an important factor controlling the composition of nematode and tardigrade communities. At the species level, the abundances of four nematodes (Chiloplectus cf. andrassyi, Aphelenchoides sp. 4, Paratripyla intermedia and Mononchidae sp.) and two tardigrades (Macrobiotus persimilis and Isohypsibius prosostomus) were significantly correlated with air pollution. Thus, the aquatic fauna of epilithic moss cushions could serve as an indicator of air pollution.

AB  - Photovoltaic technology has become a huge industry, based on the enormous applications for solar cells. In the 19th century, when photoelectric experiences started to be conducted, it would be unexpected that these optoelectronic devices would act as an essential energy source, fighting the ecological footprint brought by non-renewable sources, since the industrial revolution. Renewable energy, where photovoltaic technology has an important role, is present in 3 out of 17 United Nations 2030 goals. However, this path cannot be taken without industry and research innovation. This article aims to review and summarise all the meaningful milestones from photovoltaics history. Additionally, an extended review of the advantages and disadvantages among different technologies is done. Photovoltaics fundamentals are also presented from the photoelectric effect on a p-n junction to the electrical performance characterisation and modelling. Cells' performance under unusual conditions are summarised, such as due to temperature variation or shading. Finally, some applications are presented and some project feasibility indicators are analysed. Thus, the review presented in this article aims to clarify to readers noteworthy milestones in photovoltaics history, summarise its fundamentals and remarkable applications to catch the attention of new researchers for this interesting field.

AB  - The Henry constants upon the adsorption of inert gases with a natural isotopic composition (argon, krypton, and xenon) on activated carbon of the AG-3, VSK-5, SKT-3, and NWC 12x40 brands in a temperature range of 15-80 degrees C are determined. A positive correlation of the Henry constants with the specific surface and micropore volume and surface normalized to the unit volume of the solid phase is found. The parameters of the temperature dependence of the Henry constants are determined, and the isosteric heats of adsorption of inert gases are calculated. The experimental results are used for calculating the steady-state mode of operation of the radiochromatographic column of the radioactive-gas purification system of nuclear power plants. It is shown that, out of all the studied brands, the highest decontamination factors of the air flow from inert radioactive gases are provided by coconut shell carbons of the VSK-5 and NWC 12x40 brands, which are noticeably superior to the peat carbon activated with sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide of the SKT-3 brand (currently applied at most Russian NPPs) with respect to this indicator. Carbon of the AG-3 does not make it possible to reach the required degree of purification.

AB  - The ever-increasing environmental pollution from greenhouse gases motivates the search for methods to reduce it. One such method is the use of biodiesel fuels in the transport sector. Conventional biodiesel production generates up to 10% of a by-product, raw glycerol, whose amount continues to increase as biodiesel production volumes expand, but its demand remains limited. Recently, options have been analysed to replace the triglyceride transesterification process generally used in biodiesel production with an interesterification process that does not generate raw glycerol, instead yielding triacylglycerol that can be directly used as fuel for diesel engines by mixing with fatty acid esters. Additionally, triacylglycerol improves the low-temperature properties of fuel. The present article discusses triglyceride interesterification processes using various carboxylate esters of low molecular weight. Information is provided on raw materials that can be subjected to interesterification for biodiesel synthesis. The possible applications of chemical and enzymatic catalysis for triglyceride interesterification are discussed, and the influence of the catalyst amount, molar ratio of reactants, temperature and process duration on the effectiveness of interesterification is examined. The conditions and effectiveness of noncatalytic interesterification are also discussed in the article. Qualitative indicators of the products obtained and their conformity to the requirements of the European standard for biodiesel fuel are discussed.

AB  - The couple rapid urbanization and policy failure in controlling urban expansion was sometimes associated to soil and land degradation phenomena in both developing and developed countries. This work points to investigate the link between exurban development and soil/land degradation in the region of Athens (Greece) as a typical semiarid Mediterranean area experiencing a shift from a land-saving compact urban form to a dispersed, low-density urban expansion. The examined area is among the most populated areas in the Mediterranean basin showing an enormous population growth during the last 60 years. While low-density, dispersed urban settlements mainly developed over the decade (2000-2010) in the investigated area occupied mostly land classified at poor soil quality, the overall assessment of vegetation, climate and soil quality layers renders a complex picture in which exurban development consumed high-quality land that were classified as non-vulnerable to land degradation. On the contrary, compact urban settlements prevail in land with intermediate (or even high) soil quality but with inadequate climatic and vegetation conditions, which are classified as highly vulnerable to land degradation. Urban planning should integrate multi-dimensional indicators of soil, climate and vegetation quality to evaluate the environmental impact of exurban development.

AB  - Explicit consideration of in-stream flow requirement (IFR) has now become almost mandatory in many rivers before irrigation withdrawal is made. Thereby, the primary objective was to evaluate the IFR through hydrological approaches and compare the condition with current flow variability and trends. Flow records were collected from five discharge stations for IFR estimation. Performance of the river was also judged with respect to nine hydraulic cross-sectional data and stage data of ten water-level monitoring stations of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). Results show that since 2000, the upper Karatoa was able to meet IFR, but the lowest part of the river experienced severe deterioration in addressing its dry season functionality. Also, the decreasing trend in off-stream availability is recognized as a threat to the Singra site resulting from severe aggradations of the river beds. Attention to the less off-stream availability at Singra raises concerns over sustaining the river from drying out. It is now evident that a hydrological approach of IFR is more than just an initial rough estimate. Such a precautionary method works well to provide quick technical support and decision reference for a complex system, in particular, to find specific drying out parts of a river of concern.

AB  - The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas is an aquaculture important species and contributed significantly to total seafood production. Unfortunately, the C. gigas aquaculture industry is limited by cold water in high latitudes. On the other hand, C. angulata is well adapted to warm water but its size is much smaller. The present paper describes a comparative study of aquaculture performance of C. gigas, C. angulata and their hybrids in warm water. The growth, survival and lipid nutritional quality of inbred and hybrid oysters were monitored for one year and used as indicators to identify candidates suitable for oyster aquaculture in warm water. The main novelty of this study is the higher growth and survival rates observed in C. angulata relative to C. gigas, and the occurrence of hybrid vigour for growth and survival. Among the oysters, female C. angulata x male C. gigas hybrid has achieved the best aquaculture results in the Shantou water on the southern coast of China. The findings of the present study suggest that oyster hybridization can be an effective way to improve the beneficial traits of oyster for aquaculture, including fast growth, high survival rate and well tolerate to warm water temperature at lower latitudes.

AB  - Recently, the Arctic Route has become busier with the continuous melting of Arctic ice. However, navigation on the Arctic Route would be much more complex than in normal water as harsh environmental conditions, such as ice-covered water and scarce costal ports that may cause more uncertainty. Nowadays, with the rapid development of sensors on board, more related data has become available. Thus, implementing comprehensive Arctic maritime risk assessment is urgent and necessary in practice. This study proposes an Arctic maritime risk state assessment method including real-time risk state assessment and risk prediction. Specifically, real-time observation samples' numerical risk state would be firstly obtained with projection pursuit method from 10 risk indicators. Due to the fuzzy uncertainty of single observation set, information diffusion would be applied to provide diffusion estimation on risk probability distribution in order to depict risk state precisely. Also, the accumulated distribution can be regarded as the risk prediction for next time slot and risk entropy is introduced to depict risk tendency directly. Case study based on 'Yongsheng' is conducted to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The findings can be useful for the operators and management on board during the Arctic voyage.

AB  - Soils participate in the provision of numerous ecosystem services of great importance for the maintenance of ecosystems and human societies. Physical and chemical soils properties sustain supporting ecosystem services like plant production and the infiltration and provision of clean water. Carbon sequestration is a regulating ecosystem service important for climate regulation. Soils are also home of a large biodiversity whose participation in soil processes is critical for their sustainable use. Evaluating these functions to assess the provision of ecosystem services is an important challenge for which simple and accurate tools and methodologies are requested.
   In this work, the relationship of the soil macro-fauna with some soil-based ecosystem services was evaluated in three different regions of Colombia, Brazil and Nicaragua with rather contrasted conditions of soils and management options. In each country, we calculated a set of sub-indicators of physical quality, chemical fertility, organic matter accumulation, soil macro aggregation and macro-invertebrate communities abundance and diversity. The combination of these sub indicators in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ) provided an overall assessment of the quality of the soil and associated ecosystem services. The strong relationship observed between macrofauna indicators and soil physical, chemical and organic matter characteristics makes it a powerful tool for evaluating and monitoring soil quality.

AB  - Estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings is important to avoid abrupt shutdowns in rotary machines. An important task in RUL estimation is the construction of a suitable health indicator (HI) to infer the bearing condition. Conventional health indicators rely on features of the vibration acceleration signal and are predominantly calculated without considering its non-stationary nature. This often results in an HI with a trend that is difficult to model, as well as random fluctuations and poor correlation with bearing degradation. Therefore, this paper presents a method for constructing a bearing's HI by considering the non-stationarity of the vibration acceleration signals. The proposed method employs the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to decompose the raw signal into different sub-bands. The HI is extracted from each sub-band signal, smoothened using locally weighted regression, and evaluated using a gradient-based method. The HIs showing the best trends among all the sub-bands are iteratively accumulated to construct an HI with the best trend over the entire life of the bearing. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark bearing datasets. The results show that the proposed method yields an HI that correlates well with bearing degradation and is relatively easy to model.

AB  - This work addressed the multi-objective optimization of a biogas production system considering both environmental and economic criteria. A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model was established and solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, from which the Pareto fronts, the optimal technology combinations and operation conditions were obtained and analyzed. It's found that the system is feasible in both environmental and economic considerations after optimization. The most expensive processing section is decarbonization; the most expensive equipment is anaerobic digester; the most power-consuming processing section is digestion, followed by decarbonization and waste management. The positive green degree value on the process is attributed to processing section of digestion and waste management. 3:1 chicken feces and corn straw, solar energy, pressure swing adsorption and 3:1 chicken feces and rice straw, solar energy, pressure swing adsorption are turned out to be two robust technology combinations under different prices of methane and electricity by sensitivity analysis. The optimization results provide support for optimal design and operation of biogas production system considering environmental and economic objectives.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of sapota powder (SP) as natural preservatives and its better utilization in food processing with the incorporation of various levels of SP (2, 4, and 6%) by replacing lean meat. Based on the sensory attributes, pork patties with 4% incorporation of SP was found optimum and selected for further storage studies with control under aerobic and modified atmosphere packaging at refrigeration temperature (4 +/- 1 degrees C) for 42 days for assessing its antioxidant and antimicrobial efficiency. During entire storage period, indicators of lipid oxidative parameters such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), free fatty acids (FFA) and peroxide value (PV) followed an increasing trend for control as well as treated products; however, treated product showed a significantly (p<0.05) lower value than control. A significantly lower (p<0.05) microbial count in treated patties than control was noted during entire storage. The sensory attributes are better retained in treated product as compared to control and even on 42nd day, overall acceptability of treated patties was found to fall in moderately acceptable category (5.95 in aerobic packets and 5.91 in modified atmosphere packets). Therefore SP has potential to enhance antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of pork patties during storage.

AB  - Workers in several occupational environments are exposed to pollutants. Street vendors, for example, typically work in a high-traffic urban environment and are exposed to numerous air pollutants, including genotoxic substances emitted by motor vehicles. This study examined the genotoxic effects of exposure to air pollution. We conducted cytological analyses to assess frequencies of micronucleated (MN) and binucleated (BN) cells in a sample of exfoliated oral mucosa cells. We compared street vendors and control subjects in the city of Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and also collected quantitative information on exposure conditions of all test subjects, including concentrations of particulate matter. We found street vendors to exhibit higher frequencies of MN cells compared to the control group. We evaluated the effects of possible confounding variables on MN frequencies, namely the body mass index (BMI), age, as well as smoking and alcohol habits. Multiple linear regression analysis found no significant effects of any of those variables. Our results suggest that continued exposure to air pollution from traffic represents a major source of genotoxicity and raises concerns regarding disease prevention not only in street vendors but also other groups of people working in urban environments.

AB  - In recent times, turbulent economic development is the characteristic of the world community. Since the end of 2014, Russia is in deep crisis. This difficult situation contributes to the dynamic development of the management concepts. In conditions of extremely high competition to survive, companies are able to respond quickly to the changes in the external environment. Lean production is one of the effective modern management models, which is based on the quality. Total quality management is a method by which management and employees can become involved in the continuous improvement of the production of goods and services. Russian industry was analyzed in the context of using such management tool as total quality management. About 12.5% of the analyzed industrial enterprises are actively implementing total quality management. Two of the 85 studied enterprises attract special attention in terms of quality management. There are Russian leading companies: PJSC "AVTOVAZ" and PJSC "TMK". The particular implementation of the total quality management in the Russian industrial sector is shown by the example of these two companies. Their success is a private result for the Russian industry. The introduction of the total quality management is a necessary measure on the way to the transformation of the Russian management system and it is accelerator for achieving high performance indicators.

AB  - In April 2012, the "State policy in the field of the RF environmental development up to 2030" was approved in the Russian Federation. Its strategic goal is to maintain a favorable environment to meet the needs of present and future generations. Despite that, nowadays more than 54% of the population in 40 regions of the Russian Federation is under the influence of high and very high air pollution. The main consequences of such effects are the deterioration of health of the population, increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the problem of environmental quality is relevant for specific individuals and groups, as well as various levels of government. All of the above has identified the need for this study on improving environmental performance in models assessing the life quality of Russian population. The following tasks have been solved: analysis of the problem of Russian population life quality assessing from the standpoint of environmental indicators; analysis of the models for Russian population life quality assessment, identifying the need to improve their environmental performance; analysis of the work of life quality assessment of the population in terms how they reflect the information on environmental performance; identifying the ways of improving the methodology for Russian population life quality assessing from the standpoint of environmental conditions.

AB  - Precision irrigation offers excellent prospects in terms of saving water, reducing pollution and improving crop yield for greenhouse agriculture. However, the precision irrigation scheduling depends greatly on the environmental factors such as temperature, air pressure, wind velocity, etc. In this study, the environmental indicators in four greenhouses of Changle, Fuzhou (Jinan), Lianjiang, Fuqing in Fujian province of China were monitored, and the Penman-Monteith model was used to precisely calculate the irrigation amounts in these four typical areas. Results showed that the Penman-Monteith model could well satisfy the requirement regarding the irrigation amount calculation for the tomato under greenhouse conditions. According to the calculation result, the total irrigation amounts of Changle, Fuzhou, Lianjiang and Fuqing were 403.5, 376.7, 379.2 and 393.1 mm, respectively, and the averagely daily irrigation amounts were 1.79, 1.67, 1.69 and 1.75 mm, respectively. Similar calculation results for the four areas possibly due to that their locations were in the same province, which shared the semblable climates. Our study highlighted the importance of environmental factors when developing irrigation scheduling for greenhouse crops. This study could provide beneficial information for the precise irrigation of the greenhouse cultivation, and provide an important foundation for further development of precision agricultural decision system.

AB  - A reliable approach for the rapid and simple estimation of global microbial respiration of soils is described for determining trends in improvement or deterioration of soil quality for various environmental scenarios. Considering the initial respiratory response of microbial populations to glucose, the method quantifies CO2 production by impedance measurements. The effect of key operational conditions on the rate of CO2 produced was evaluated by response surface methodology. The method provides reproducible estimates of biomass (relative standard deviation <10%) using a relatively small soil sample (5 g). The procedure consisted on pre-wetting the soil samples at 70% of field capacity for 2 h, mixing with 10 mg g(-1) glucose, incubating at 30 degrees C into the respirometer system and measuring substrate induced respiration (SIR) rates over 6 h. Results from soil samples under different anthropogenic perturbations showed significant (P < 0.001) differences in CO2 contents (mg h(-1) 100 g(-1)) produced by agricultural (3.3) and mining soils (1.3). Factor analysis revealed a strong relationship between SIR, soil pH, cation exchange capacity and electrical conductivity. The results evidence the method's capacity to discriminate different human activities using the CO2 rate as indicator. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth in the use of sustainability indicators and ratings in the real estate industry has been accompanied by strong criticism of the most commonly used rating systems designed to evaluate the sustainability performance of real estate developments. Most of these criticisms focus on the content of the different rating systems. A systematic evaluation of the methodologies of sustainability ratings is lacking. This article builds a framework that can be used to evaluate the methodologies of sustainability ratings and applies the evaluation framework to five widely used sustainability ratings for homes and communities (BREAAM, CASBEE, Estidama, Green Star, LEED). The evaluation results highlight three major shortcomings in the rating systems that have been evaluated. First, the systems lack unambiguous definitions of sustainability. They give insufficient explanation of why certain components are included in the ratings and on what basis these components have been accorded their weights. Second, the rating systems put more emphasis on sustainable design than performance, especially for the ratings for communities. Finally, the ratings are generally not responsive to local conditions of a project. Each rating system has its particular strengths and weaknesses and no system is superior on all dimensions. The proposed evaluation framework can be applied to sustainability ratings in different industries and is adaptable depending on stakeholder requirements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Risk assessment is necessary for registration and risk management of new pesticides. The aim of this article is to discuss challenges that risk assessors in Africa face when conducting risk assessment of pesticides. Risk assessment requires toxicity assessment, environmental fate studies, and the use of models for occupational, dietary, residential, and environmental exposure assessments. Toxicity studies are very costly with the result that toxicity data used to register pesticides in Africa are often sourced from northern hemisphere countries. Assessors also often use exposure modeling results from the northern hemisphere. This is not an ideal approach as occupational exposure is influenced by agricultural practices, climatic conditions, and other factors. Furthermore, residential exposure models require time-location-activity information, exposure factors, and toxicokinetic rate constants for particular pesticides. Dietary exposure assessment needs accurate and comprehensive local food consumption data. Authorities in African countries should therefore generate the required data, despite these being very costly and tedious. Authorities should also provide guidance on the type of models and standard scenarios for estimating predicted environmental concentrations in various environmental compartments. It is recommended that higher educational institutions in Africa should incorporate risk assessment in general and pesticide toxicity and exposure models in particular in their curricula.

AB  - Stormwater reuse is increasingly popular in the worldwide. In terms of urban road stormwater, it commonly contains toxic pollutants such as heavy metals, which could undermine the reuse safety. The research study investigated heavy metal build-up characteristics on urban roads in a typical megacity of South China. The research outcomes show the high variability in heavy metal build-up loads among different urban road sites. The degree of traffic congestion and road surface roughness was found to exert a more significant influence on heavy metal build-up rather than traffic volume. Due to relatively higher heavy metal loads, stormwater from roads with more congested traffic conditions or rougher surfaces might be suitable for low-water-quality required activities while the stormwater from by-pass road sections could be appropriate for relatively high-water-quality required purposes since the stormwater could be relatively less polluted. Based on the research outcomes, a decision-making process for heavy metals based urban road stormwater reuse was proposed. The new finding highlights the importance to undertaking a "fit-for-purpose" road stormwater reuse strategy. Additionally, the research results can also contribute to enhancing stormwater reuse safety. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coral islands around the world are threatened by changing climates. Rising seas, drought, and increased tropical storms are already impacting island ecosystems. We aim to better understand lichen community ecology of coral island forests. We used an epiphytic lichen community survey to gauge Pisonia (Pisonia grandis R.BR.), which dominates forest conditions on Heron Island, Australia. Nine survey plots were sampled for lichen species presence and abundance, all tree diameters and species, GPS location, distance to forest-beach edge, and dominant forest type. Results found only six unique lichens and two lichen associates. A Multi-Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) test found statistically distinct lichen communities among forest types. The greatest group differences were between interior Pisonia and perimeter forest types. Ordinations were performed to further understand causes for distinctions in lichen communities. Significant explanatory gradients were distance to forest edge, tree density (shading), and Pisonia basal area. Each of these variables was negatively correlated with lichen diversity and abundance, suggesting that interior, successionally advanced, Pisonia forests support fewer lichens. Island edge and presumably younger forests-often those with greater tree diversity and sunlight penetration-supported the highest lichen diversity. Heron Island's Pisonia-dominated forests support low lichen diversity which mirrors overall biodiversity patterns. Lichen biomonitoring may provide a valuable indicator for assessing island ecosystems for conservation purposes regionally.

AB  - Ecological Momentary Assessment has been used to investigate a wide range of behaviors and psychiatric conditions. Previous investigations have consistently obtained promising results with high acceptance and compliance rates, and with only minor reactive effects for specific variables. Despite the promise of this methodology for the study of severe psychiatric populations, little is known about its feasibility in samples at risk for suicide. In the present study, four samples at varying risk for suicide completed an Ecological Momentary Assessment study by responding to five electronic assessments per day over a one-week period. Samples included healthy controls (n=13), affective controls (n=21), past suicide attempters (n=20), and recent suicide attempters (n= 42). The results demonstrate satisfactory participation rates and high compliance with daily life repeated assessments across all groups. Importantly, negative thoughts or suicidal ideation were not reactive to the duration of the study, indicating that the repeated assessment of such cognitions in daily life have little or no effect on their frequency. The findings provide support for the use of Ecological Momentary Assessment in the study of suicidal ideation and suggest that mobile technologies represent new opportunities for the assessment of high-risk cognitive states experienced by patients in daily life.

AB  - Anthropogenic salinization of freshwaters is a global concern. Coal surface mining causes release of dissolved sulfate, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and other ions to surface waters in central Appalachia, USA, through practices that include mine rock disposal in valley fills (VFs). This region's surface waters naturally have low salinity, with specific conductance (SC, a salinity indicator) generally <200S/cm, and aquatic impacts have been found when SC exceeds the 300 to 500S/cm range. We analyzed SC in waters emerging from 137 VFs over periods of 1 to 23years. Mean SCs for these VFs ranged from 227 to 2,866S/cm, generally rose during and immediately following construction, but often declined during latter portions of longer monitoring records. Seventy-four of 103 VFs with postconstruction data had SC trends that fit negative quadratic forms. Of the 16 revegetated VFs with at least five years of SC data past the quadratic maximum, the mean quadratic maximum was 1,464 (+/- 696) S/cm and the model projected time required to approach natural conditions (by declining to <500S/cm) was 19.6 (+/- 6.6) years after VF construction initiation, indicating long-lasting but not permanent aquatic impacts due to elevated (>500S/cm) SC.

AB  - Algal blooms are a seasonal problem in eutrophic water bodies, and novel approaches to algal removal are required. The effect of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) on the removal of Microcystis aeruginosa was investigated using a laboratory scale device. Samples treated by HC were subsequently grown under illuminated culture conditions. The results demonstrated that a short treatment with HC could effectively settle naturally growing M. aeruginosa without breaking cells. Algal cell density and chlorophyll-a of a sample treated for 10 min were significantly decreased by 88% andv 94%, respectively, after 3 days culture. Various HC operating parameters were investigated, showing that inhibition of M. aeruginosa growth mainly depended on treatment time and pump pressure. Electron microscopy confirmed that sedimentation of algae was attributable to the disruption of intracellular gas vesicles. Damage to the photosynthetic apparatus also contributed to the inhibition of algal growth. Free radicals produced by the cavitation process could be as an indirect indicator of the intensity of HC treatment, although they inflicted minimal damage on the algae. In conclusion, we suggest that HC represents a potentially highly effective and sustainable approach to the removal of algae from water systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In South African grasslands, rangeland management is strongly related to land tenure. Communal farms are reported to exhibit less desirable vegetation conditions for livestock than commercial farms. Time series of high spatial and temporal resolution imagery may be useful for improved evaluation of these rangelands as they provide information at a spatial scale similar to the typical scale of field assessments and may thus overcome the limited spatio-temporal representativeness of field measurements. A time series of 13 RapidEye images over one growing season (2010-2011) was used to explore spectral differences between and within two management systems (commercial vs. communal). Isomap ordination was applied to map continuous spectral dissimilarities of sample plots. Using regression with simultaneous autoregressive models (SAR), dissimilarities were subsequently related to ecological variables of plant and soil, including indicators for grazing effects. The largest differences were found between sample plots of communal and commercial farms. Vegetation attributes were significantly related to dissimilarities in reflectance, both from the growing season and the dormant period. However, these relationships did not suggest vegetation degradation on communal farms. They further suggest that a management-related pattern of grazing disturbance in the summer months led to spectral differences between farms but could have impaired the detailed characterization of spectral dissimilarities related to differences in vegetation composition.

AB  - Phenological trends provide important indicators of environmental change and population dynamics. However, the use of untested population-level measures can lead to incorrect conclusions about phenological trends, particularly when changes in population structure or density are ignored. We used individual-based estimates of birth date and lactation duration of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) to investigate energetic consequences of changes in pupping phenology. Using generalized linear mixed models, we first demonstrate annual variation in pupping phenology. Second, we show a negative relationship between lactation duration and the timing of pupping, indicating that females who pup early nurse their pups longer, thereby highlighting lactation duration as a useful proxy of female condition and resource availability. Third, individual-based data were used to derive a population-level proxy that demonstrated an advance in pupping date over the last 25 years, co-incident with a reduction in population abundance that resulted from fisheries-related shootings. These findings demonstrate that phenological studies examining the impacts of climate change on mammal populations must carefully control for changes in population density and highlight how joint investigations of phenological and demographic change provide insights into the drivers of population declines.

AB  - The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region has experienced rapid economic and population growth in the last three decades. The delta includes coastal megacities, such as Hong Kong. These low-lying urbanised coastal regions in the PRD are vulnerable to flood risks from unpredictable climatic conditions. These can result in increasing storm surges, rising sea level and intensified rainstorms causing coastal and inland flooding, all of which impact the delta. This paper has taken the coastal megacity of Hong Kong as a case, focusing on two study sites: Shenzhen River and Tai O town, chosen for their peculiar inland and coastal flood problems. A sustainable flood risk appraisal (SFRA) template was developed against which sustainable flood risk management (FRM) practices in these sites were benchmarked. Thirty-eight stakeholders were interviewed during this research in order to understand the current FRM practices, their barriers and their constraints. It was found that FRM in the case study currently focuses on hard engineering, while neglecting other important sustainability indicators. A SFRA practice that takes public participation, equity of flood preparedness and environmental friendly into account could be effective in achieving sustainable flood risk mitigation practices in Hong Kong and other coastal cities in the PRD.

AB  - The institutional background against which air transport is supplied has been changing rapidly. The initiation of market forces has led to lower fares, additional services, and more efficient airline companies as competitive pressures have grown. A major concern, however, is whether the resultant airline market is sustainable in the long-term. There have been periodic short-term shocks to the market, the most recent being the rapid rise in kerosene prices, but there are more fundamental issues concerning the possibility of excess competition being a generic feature of providing scheduled services in a competitive environment. Market stability is not easily tested, but some indicators can be explored to get better insights. Here we examine the fares offered in selected Portuguese air transport markets for 2005-2006 to assess the ability of carriers to recover their full costs - a necessary condition for stability. In particular, the paper is concerned with the pressures of competition on the ability of airlines to increase the fares that they offer as the scheduled date of departure approaches; such fares contribute significantly to an airline's recovery of full costs. The evidence suggests that in many cases airlines cannot, when confronted by competition, extract additional revenues from last minute, low-price elasticity passengers and that this could reduce the economic sustainability of some services in Europe.

AB  - Beetle remains from a small bog in southern Sweden contribute information concerning the forest history of the Study area. The study shows that beetles are valuable indicators of woodland structures such as openness, field vegetation, presence of dead wood and disturbance factors such as climate change, fire regimes, grazing and land use. The early Holocene, ca. 8600-6450 cal. BC, was characterised by open, pine-dominated woodlands maintained by fire and grazing disturbances. The changes in the wetland fauna, between 8600 and 7500 cal. BC, correlate well with low lake levels in Southern Sweden. During the mid Holocene, ca. 6450-2400 cal. BC, the woodlands were relatively dense, with few openings in the canopy. Around 4200 cal. BC, there was a shift to a dominance of deciduous trees. Fire and grazing pressures were particularly low. Numbers of aquatic and hygrophilic beetles indicate dry conditions between ca. 5000 and 3000 cal. BC. During the late Holocene, ca. 2400 cal. BC to present, the woodlands opened Lip mainly through increased land use. The main disturbance factors were fire and grazing. The beetles indicate the formation of heather-dominated heathland around 800 cal. BC. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In Turkey, herbicide active ingredient (a.i.) was used approximately 25% in pesticide applications in 2007. In Adana province, Turkey, 10 numbers of active ingredients were used for weed control in wheat cultivation areas in 2007. These are: fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, clodinafop-propargyl, mesosulfuronmethyl, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, florasulam, flumetsulam, 2,4-D acid dimethylamin, tribenuron-methyl, triasulfuron and dicamba. In this study, total risk of herbicide on human health and environment were assessed by POCER (The Pesticide Occupational and Environmental Risk) indicator. In this study, it was obtained that clodinafop-propargyl a.i. has high potential risk for worker (1.000) and operator (0.909) due to 1.000 of maximum EF values. Flumetsulam a.i, and triasulfuron a.i. have no total risk for human health and environment due to 0 EF values in all risk indicators. In this study, it was shown that human health has been affected higher than environment in herbicide applications. It was determined that risk for human health contains 88.7% of total risk values in herbicide application for wheat cultivation areas. It was shown that, in this study, some factors affecting proper application of herbicides such as application techniques and equipment, meteorological conditions and application doses should be taken into account for protecting of human health and environment.

AB  - Assessment of recharge in a structurally complex upland karst limestone aquifer situated in a semi-arid environment is difficult. Resort to surrogate indicators such as measurement of spring outflow and borehole discharge, is a common alternative, and attempts to apply conventional soil moisture deficit analysis may not adequately account for the intermittent spate conditions that arise in such environments. A modelling approach has been made using the West Bank Mountain Aquifer system in the Middle East as a trial. The model uses object oriented software which allows various objects to be switched on and off. Each of the main recharge processes identified in the West Bank is incorporated. The model allows either conventional soil moisture deficit analysis calculations or wetting threshold calculations to be made as appropriate, and accommodates both direct recharge and secondary recharge. Daily time steps enable recharge and runoff routing to be calculated for each node. Model runs have enabled a series of simulations for each of the three aquifer basins in the West Bank and for the whole of the West Bank. These provide recharge estimates comparable to those prepared by earlier workers by conventional means. The model is adaptable and has been successfully used in other environments.

AB  - Wood stake weight loss has been used as an index of wood decomposition in mineral soil, but it may not give a reliable estimate in cold boreal forests where decomposition is very slow. Various wood stake strength tests have been used as surrogates of weight loss, but little is known on which test would give the best estimate of decomposition over a variety of soil temperature conditions. Our study showed that radial compression strength (RCS) was a better indicator of wood strength change in southern pine (Pinus spp.) and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) than surface hardness or longitudinal shear. The suitability of using the RCS to measure wood decomposition in boreal mineral soils was tested in six Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations along a North-South gradient from Finland to Poland. After 3 years RCS losses ranged from 20% in northern Finland to 94% in central Poland, compared to dry weight losses of 3% and 65%.

AB  - Common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina serpentina) have an extensive range across North America, inhabiting aquatic habitats in diverse thermal and hydric climates. Although geographic variation in reproductive characters such as female size, clutch size, and egg mass have been investigated, little is known about geographic variation in egg components. In this study, we examined variation in the water content, solid content, and shell mass of snapping turtle eggs from four populations dispersed along a longitudinal geographic transect (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nebraska). Initial egg mass and dry shell mass were similar among these four populations. However, water contents of eggs correlated positively with longitude, whereas dry content mass correlated negatively with longitude. Moreover, water content of eggs correlated negatively with the average number of days per year where average air temperatures exceeded 15 degreesC in a particular region (an indicator of regional thermal climate), and dry content of eggs correlated positively with both the number of days per year where average air temperatures exceeded 15 degreesC and the average total precipitation for the months of May through September (an indicator of regional hydric climate). These findings suggest that egg content (and perhaps egg quality) in this wide-ranging species of turtle varies in a manner reflecting differences in climate.

AB  - A random block design with six replications was used to study different methods for stimulating the asexual reproduction of Leucaena leucocaphala cv Peru. The experiment lasted five months The first treatment consisted of mixing 200 mg indoloacetic acid and 300 mg naphthalenacetic acid with 1 kg of zeolite powder (F-ICA-1). In the second experiment, 200 mg indoloacetic acid and 1000 mg naphthalenacetic acid were mixed with zeolite (F-ICA-2). There was a control treatment with zeolite only. At the end of the experiment, the aerial parts of the plant showed an inverse performance to that of the roots in stimulant concentrations. The length of regrowths was 28.8 cm and DM yield was 32.81 g with F-ICA-2, No root development was observed. The values with F-ICA1 formula were 3.09 cm and 14.8 g DM respectively. Five roots and 20 small roots 20 cm in length and a DM yield of 8.4 g were formed. The treatment with no auxins showed the poorest performance in all the indicators studied. It is concluded that a lower concentration of F-ICA-1 produced a more integral biological result. However, a longer duration experiment under field conditions, including a control with botanical seeds, is necessary.

T2  - HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU

AB  - In low water level situations, it is hard to manage all water resource requirements. EDF, in particular, uses water for energy purposes both for heat production means which require a minimum flow for their cooling and for dilution of their effluents, and for its hydraulic production means whose reserves allow expensive fuels to be saved during peak demand periods. Use of water resources must also take into account the additional demand corresponding to other needs such as agricultural, industrial, tourist or related to water quality. In such conditions, to ensure optimum management of a dam, knowledge and short-term forecasting of natural flows enable water to be released in sufficient quantity to satisfy downstream needs while ensuring maximum water savings to cope with future needs. Moreover, simulation of long-term hydrological scenarios makes it possible to forecast the occurrence of events identified as critical, such as the overshooting of certain flow thresholds or their persistence in time, in order to anticipate the consequences of these events on operation of the installed production base. EDF is therefore gradually acquiring the tools needed for knowledge and forecasting of water resources in low water level situations: pluviometric and hydrometric stations, conceptual and statistical hydrological forecast models, data servers, low water level indicator statistical analysis models, water resource indicators. This approach is illustrated by the current achievements and developments in the Vienne and Loire basins.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this paper was to highlight the results of the study of the influence of the soil fertility and financial support on the formation of sustainable competitiveness of Ukrainian agricultural enterprises.
   Methodology / approach. To achieve the purpose, we used such methods: correlation analysis (to identify and assess the close relationship between the ecological-agrochemical assessment of soils, financial support per hectare, and the sustainable competitiveness); econometric modeling (to develop a mathematical model of the dependence of the subindex of competitiveness by the yield on the ecological-agrochemical assessment of soils and the financial support per hectare); economic-statistical and monographic (for the assessment and analysis of the influence of the ecological-agrochemical assessment of soils and financial support per hectare on the formation of sustainable competitiveness); abstract-and-logical (for generalization and analysis of the research results); graphical (for the visual representation of the revealed dependencies). The study was performed on a selected sample of agricultural enterprises of districts of Kharkiv, Volyn and Chernihiv region, which represent all the soil-climatic zones of Ukraine. The time range of this research covers the years 2010-2016. The database of the 189 observations in Kharkiv region, 93 in Volyn region and 88 - in Chernihiv region was as the empirical basis.
   Results. This paper presents empirical evidence for the impact of the soil fertility and financial support on the formation of sustainable competitiveness of enterprises. The obtained results prove the hypothesis of a positive relationship between the ecological-agrochemical assessment of soils, financial support per hectare, and the sustainable competitiveness of subjects, however, the level of impact of soil fertility differs significantly in different soil-climatic conditions. It is shown that soil fertility and financial support can sometimes act as substitutes, for example, in a zone of insufficient moisture or low soil fertility. Increasing the financial support for agricultural production per hectare may be a strategy to increase productivity when soils are less fertile.
   Originality / scientific novelty. For the first time, one- and two factor linear and quadratic econometric models were developed, which made it possible to carry out quantitative assessment of the impact of the ecological-agrochemical assessment of soils and the financial support per hectare on the formation of the subindex of competitiveness by the yield in various soil-climatic zones of Ukraine. The provision on the formation of the subindex of competitiveness by the yield under the conditions of the economic law of diminishing returns, was further developed.
   Practical value / implications. The main results of the study can be used for (1) estimation and forecasting of the level of competitiveness depending on the ecological-agrochemical assessment of soils and the financial support per hectare; (ii) determining the effect of measures to improve the soil fertility on the competitiveness; (iii) determining the impact of soil degradation on competitiveness of agribusiness entities; (iv) identification of reserves to improve competitiveness.

AB  - The ability to regionally monitor crop progress and condition through the growing season benefits both crop management and yield estimation. In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using field observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2-4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1-3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8-10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2-3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1-2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1-3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.

AB  - The paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of the species composition of live ground cover, understory and undergrowth in the largest park Sosnovka in Saint Petersburg over a long observation period. The main part of the park is represented by phytocenoses of natural origin, where the research objects located at different distances from the main walking routes are chosen. The stand in all sites is represented by pine with a small admixture of birch. The forest type is a polytric pine forest, of the 5th quality class. The growing stock is 60 ... 80 m(3)/ha. The vegetation of the understory is recorded comprehensively on circular discount areas of 10 m(2). 30 plots are established at each site, where species composition, height structure, quantity and condition of undergrowth; species composition, height structure, quantity of understory; species composition, occurrence and projective cover of live ground cover are taken into account simultaneously. In addition, we record the share of the spontaneous footpath network. According to the results of the study, the species composition of undergrowth, understory and grass and shrub layer is established. Additional quantitative and qualitative indicators (number, height structure, occurrence, vital state) are determined for each structural element of the phytocenosis. We reveal the peculiarities of the species composition changes of the lower storey vegetation over a 16-year period. The patterns of development in the grass and shrub layer composition at a distance from hiking trails and roads are found. The analysis is performed using the Jaccard's coefficient of community. The species composition of the live ground cover is different in the objects of the study. The experimental sites remote from the main walking routes have the uniform distribution of grass and shrub species. This fact is proved using the Shennikov's coefficient of species dispersion. The young generation of the main species is represented by pine, spruce and birch with the predominance of small (up to 0.5 m) undergrowth. The softwood dying off, a decrease in the number of pine and spruce undergrowth, an insignificant increase in the number of understory, the appearance of seedling growth of oak and maple under the canopy of pine and birch stands in the amount of 60 ... 200 specimens/ha are observed. Mountain ash, buckthorn, arrowwood, cherry in abundance of up to 400 specimens/ha are noted in understory of all experimental plots. The obtained results demonstrate the grass and shrub layer as the most vulnerable structural element of park phytocoenoses. Depending on the intensity of recreation (removal of the experimental site from the main recreation route of citizens), the number of extinct species of herbaceous plants over a 16-year period varies from 3 to 6, and the appearance of 1-3 new species is marked. The authors make a conclusion about the significant influence of visitors on the composition, structure and condition of live ground cover, undergrowth and understory.

AB  - Performing predictive maintenance (PdM) is challenging for many reasons. Dealing with large datasets which may not contain run-to-failure data (R2F) complicates PdM even more. When no R2F data are available, identifying condition indicators (CIs), estimating the health index (HI), and thereafter, calculating a degradation model for predicting the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) are merely impossible using supervised learning. In this paper, a 3 DoF delta robot used for pick and place task is studied. In the proposed method, autoencoders (AEs) are used to predict when maintenance is required based on the signal sequence distribution and anomaly detection, which is vital when no R2F data are available. Due to the sequential nature of the data, nonlinearity of the system, and correlations between parameter time-series, convolutional layers are used for feature extraction. Thereafter, a sigmoid function is used to predict the probability of having an anomaly given CIs acquired from AEs. This function can be manually tuned given the sensitivity of the system or optimized by solving a minimax problem. Moreover, the proposed architecture can be used for fault localization for the specified system. Additionally, the proposed method can calculate RUL using Gaussian process (GP), as a degradation model, given HI values as its input.

AB  - The main control rooms of passive nuclear plants must maintain a habitable environment once station-blackout accidents occur. In this condition, the heavy fin-concrete ceiling on the room will remove heat from kind of heat sources and protect from overheating environment. However, the dynamic thermal process of finned concrete ceiling has not been studied in various passive cooling measures. In this study, an efficient parametric resistance-capacitance thermal network model is established to describe dynamic thermal responses of heavy fin-concrete layer, and validated by dynamic temperature change data of a hot-box experiment for 24 h. Series indicators were deduced by analytic solutions. Based on the validated model and indicators, factor analysis was conducted to obtain details of effect of finned-plate geometric parameters and heat source intensity. The results show that initial 2-h thermal process can be divided into two stage, "transient stage" and "quasi-stable stage". The transient-stage thermal process is determined by source flux and finned coefficient of finned plate. The quasi-stable thermal process depends on thermal mass of the finned plate and heat source flux. Furthermore, there exists a linear relationship between air temperature and heat source flux. Finned plate layout can be design according to the factor assessment results.

AB  - The main objective of the article is an attempt to identify factors/determinants conditioning the development of enterprises in Poland over the last 5 years. The author will also try to indicate the dominant behaviours related to the notion of entrepreneurship among the owners of the enterprises under study and identify the relations between the variables related to enterprise management and its development and growth. In addition to the literature analysis, the author chose a survey in the form of a structured interview with business owners as another research method - the survey was carried out in 2018 and 2019 in 200 purposively selected enterprises from the SME sector, which are based in Poland and were established in the last 5 years. After the analysis of the literature and the results of the conducted survey, obviously bearing in mind its pilot character, the author clarified the names of the selected indicators/determinants and expanded their list by those he considered useful from the point of view of the general purpose of the survey - 9 indicators/determinants. In the author's opinion, the developed indicators/determinants make it possible to assess the level of enterprise development (direction and pace of changes) depending on selected factors of the local and institutional environment, internal factors, the level of achieved financial results, sources of financing.

AB  - In this paper, a new approach for mapping polygenic depressions colonised by vegetation is presented. These spatially periodic vegetation patterns situated in the arid areas of North Africa are known locally as "Dayas". The mapping of these structures is an important component in monitoring their evolution which can be regarded as an indicator of socio-environmental conditions. For this purpose, a method based on satellite image analysis is proposed. First, Landsat Thematic Mapper image inspection is performed to highlight the vegetation spots using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Then, a Differential Morphological Profile (DMP) which includes both spectral and morphological information, is built for each NDVI pixel. We adapt the F-Score technique combined with the SVM classifier, to select and classify the most effective DMP images in order to extract the Daya?s signature. Using feature selection, overall classification accuracy reached 97.8% with a kappa value of 95.61 but also reduced the dimension of the DMP vector. Dayas? morphological and vegetation characteristics are related to their degree of evolution. Furthermore, we categorise categorise the 170 extracted Dayas into three classes according to their size. On the resulting map, each class corresponds to a specific morphological and vegetation evolution stage.

AB  - Sunlight-mediated inactivation of microorganisms is a low-cost approach to disinfect drinking water and wastewater. The reactions involved are affected by a wide range of factors, and a lack of knowledge about their relative importance makes it challenging to optimize treatment systems. To characterize the relative importance of environmental conditions, photoreactivity, water quality, and engineering design in the sunlight inactivation of viruses, we modeled the inactivation of three-human adenovirus and two bacteriophages-MS2 and phiX174-in surface waters and waste stabilization ponds by integrating solar irradiance and aquatic photochemistry models under uncertainty. Through global sensitivity analyses, we quantitatively apportioned the variability of predicted sunlight inactivation rate constants to different factors. Most variance was associated with the variability in and interactions among time, location, nonpurgeable organic carbon (NPOC) concentration, and pond depth. The photolysis quantum yield of the virus outweighed the seasonal solar motion in the impact on inactivation rates. Further, comparison of simulated sunlight inactivation efficacy in maturation ponds under different design decisions showed that reducing pond depth can increase the log inactivation at the cost of larger land area, but increasing hydraulic retention time by adding ponds in series yielded greater improvements in inactivation.

AB  - The 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) is an organic matter indicator used for the maintenance management of inertwaste landfill sites. Previously, we indicated that oxygen consumption derived from the nitrification reaction (N-BOD5) might have a non-negligible contribution to BOD5 in leachate. In this study, we investigated changes over time of organic matter indicators in leachate of an inert-waste landfill site, and searched for factors responsible for fluctuations of N-BOD5. Water quality was measured in two kinds of leachate, before (LBA) and after aeration (LAA), each month from September 2011 to February 2016. The N-BOD5 component of BOD5 in LAA was higher than that of LBA. The N-BOD5 in LAA showed a significant positive correlation with ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and NH4-N in LAA also had a significant positive correlation with precipitation. As a result of NH4-N addition test, N-BOD5 in LAA was increased, but N-BOD5 in LBA was hardly affected. Furthermore, the composition ratio of nitrifying bacteria in LAA was higher than that in LBA. Therefore, it was suggested that fluctuations of N-BOD5 are related to the aerobic condition of the environment, NH4-N levels and the presence of nitrifying bacteria, and are indirectly influenced by precipitation.

AB  - Macrophytes react to changes in the quality of the environment in which they live (water/sediment), and they are good bioindicators of surface water conditions. In the present study, the content of the metals cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) was determined in the sediment, the water, and different organs of macrophytes from six localities around Lake Skadar, across four different seasons of year. The aquatic macrophytes that have been used as bioindicator species in this study are Phragmites australis (an emerged species), Ceratophyllum demersum (a submerged species), and Lemna minor (a floating species). The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of metals in macrophyte tissues and also to discover the degree of bioaccumulation of the investigated metals, depending both on the location and on the season. The content of Co and Ni in the examined parts of the macrophytes was in the range of 0.04-8.78 and 0.30-28.5 ppm, respectively. The greatest content of the investigated metal in the organs of P. australis and C. demersum was recorded at the beginning of and during the growing season. Greater concentrations of metals in the tissue of L. minor were observed at the end of the growing season.

AB  - This paper measures quality of life (QoL) in the 393 largest Spanish municipalities in 2011. We follow recent descriptions of QoL dimensions to propose an integrated framework composed of eight dimensions: material living conditions, health, education, environment, economic and physical safety, governance and political voice, social interaction, and personal activities. Using different sources of information we construct 16 indicators, two per each of the QoL dimensions considered. Weight constrained data envelopment analysis (DEA) is then used to estimate a composite indicator of the QoL of each municipality. Robustness is checked by altering the weight ranges introduced within the DEA specification. Results show that the Northern and Central regions in Spain attain the highest levels of QoL, while the Southern and Mediterranean regions report lower scores. These figures are consistent with those obtained by Gonzalez et al. (Soc Ind Res 82:111-145 2011) for the Spanish municipalities in 2001, although both the sample and the indicators used are different. The analysis also shows that, while it is important to restrict weights in DEA, the specific restrictions used are less important, since all the composite indicators computed are highly correlated. The results also show important differences between per capita gross domestic product and QoL at the provincial level.

AB  - The handheld point of care analyzer is a quick and feasible option to obtain hematology data from individuals. The iSTAT-1 (R) was used to evaluate select venous blood analytes obtained via jugular venipuncture from 238 passerine birds from South Texas. These data were used to assess the health of birds in the area while taking into consideration life history (migratory or sedentary), locale, seasonality, sex, and age. We attributed increased values of pO(2) and hematocrit, in addition to hemoglobin and glucose concentrations of migratory birds compared to sedentary birds as the increased need of oxygen carrying capacity and energy for long duration flights. Increased glucose and lower ionized calcium concentrations were observed in migratory birds likely based on breakdown of fat deposits in the body to fuel the muscular endurance of migration. During the hotter months of the year, birds' responses to handling were exhibited by relative respiratory acidosis. When sedentary birds sampled from South Texas were compared to a previous study from Central Texas, venous blood analytes differed by locale but were within the ranges of healthy populations. These findings lead us to conclude that sedentary avian communities can be used as ecosystem bioindicators.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe relationships among compost bedded pack barn (CBP) measurements (moisture, internal temperature, nutrient content, and bedding bacterial counts), ambient weather conditions, and udder health. Data was collected every 2-weeks (n=25 visits) from 8 Kentucky dairy farms with CBP from May 2013 to May 2014. A single observer scored 50 cows per farm for hygiene and collected compost internal temperature, moisture, and compost samples from 9 evenly distributed areas in each barn. Weighted average somatic cell count (SCC), high SCC prevalence (HSP), and reported clinical mastitis incidence (RCMI) were collected from herd records and milking personnel.
   Compost internal temperature increased with increasing maximum barn temperature (BT). Compost moisture content decreased with increasing BT. Herd hygiene score decreased with increasing BT and increased with increasing compost moisture content. Herd SCC and HSP both increased with increasing BT but were unaffected by compost measurements. As compost internal temperature increased, staphylococci, streptococci, and bacilli species growth in the pack area decreased and coliform species growth increased. Low CBP moisture and high CBP temperature reduced bacteria levels. Cow hygiene and udder health indicators had a stronger relationship with BT than with CBP internal temperature and moisture.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the acute toxicity of raw and treated wastewater generated by the rice parboiling industry using zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm quality as a bioindicator. Toxicity bioassays were conducted comparing physicochemical parameters of sperm quality for zebrafish at sublethal conditions (n = 150 fish, 50 per treatment). Acute toxicity was detected in all sperm quality parameters assessed for both raw and treated wastewater, when contrasted to the control (p < 0.05). For zebrafish exposed to raw effluent, negative correlations with parameters of sperm quality were observed for the concentration of iron, phosphorus and total suspended solids (p < 0.05). Salinity, the biochemical oxygen demand and the concentration of total suspended solids were negatively correlated with parameters of sperm quality for zebrafish exposed to treated effluent (p < 0.05). In comparison with the levels observed for the raw effluent, most physicochemical parameters of the treated effluent were reduced to levels within the limits required by the environmental legislation. Despite the physical and chemical parameters measured in the treated wastewater meeting environmental legislation thresholds, acute toxicity persisted. These results show that the sperm quality can be used as a bioindicator for wastewater toxicity and release of wastewater to surface water could affect the fertility of fishes.

AB  - We report behavioral regulation of body water content in caddisfly larvae, Hydropsyche morosa and Cheumatopsyche pettiti, by selecting microhabitats with different water flow rates. The purpose of our study was to examine features necessary for survival in the same apparent habitat, because the two species co- exist in riffle areas of freshwater streams. Both species are highly sensitive to water loss as a result of high water loss rates and depend on immersion in fresh water (hypo-osmotic) to maintain water stores. In contrast to C. pettiti, H. morosa is larger, retains water more effectively, and features reduced water loss rates with suppressed activation energies. When H. morosa was confined to areas of low or no water flow, overhydration led to rapid mortality, whereas the same conditions favored water balance maintenance and survival in C. pettiti. In attraction bioassays, H. morosa moved and remained within areas of high water flow and C. pettiti preferred areas with low water flow. Because water flow rates are unlikely to directly impact water gain, the mechanism responsible for increased survival and water balance maintenance is likely related to the impact of water flow on oxygen availability, differences in feeding ecology, or other underlying factors.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts to island systems can have deleterious effects on coastal aquatic ecosystems. These effects can alter water quality, primary production as well as habitat. Land development often fragments hydrologic connectivity within aquatic ecosystems forcing alterations in nutrient transport and increases the potential for eutrophication. Dove Sound, a tidal lagoon located in the Upper Florida Keys on Key Largo, has been subjected to anthropogenic influences of land development during the last century. To investigate these influences a short sediment core was collected from within Dove Sound and investigated using Pb-210 dating, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and sedimentary pigments. Results indicated that Dove Sound has undergone eutrophication and the primary producer community structure has shifted from dominantly macrophytic to a system that supports substantial algal production. While septic waste was a possible source for eutrophication, low delta N-15 did not support this conclusion. However, the timing of the shifts in Dove Sound along with indicators of anoxia leads to the conclusion that fragmentation caused by the construction of a railroad was the root cause. The hydrologic fragmentation reduced the flushing rates, thereby enhancing anoxic conditions in the system and increasing the internal nutrient loading.

AB  - Biodiesel is a green, safe, renewable alternative fuel, which is of great significance to solving the problem of energy shortage and environmental pollution. A series of solid base catalysts were prepared with the support of attapulgite (ATP), the load of C4H5O6KNa by impregnation method, and were used to catalyze transesterification of soybean oil with methanol to biodiesel. The activities of prepared catalysts were investigated compared to pure ATP. The optimal conditions for the catalyst preparation were investigated: molar ratio of Na : ATP was 1.7: 1 and calcination temperature was 400 degrees C. The prepared catalysts were characterized by several techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements, X-ray diffraction and the Hammett indicator method. The prepared solid base catalyst can be separated from reaction system effectively and easily. The effects of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction temperature and amount of catalyst on the biodiesel yield were investigated. The experimental results showed that a 22: 1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, 10.0% of catalyst amount, 65 degrees C of reaction temperature and 3.0 h of reaction time gave the best results. The catalyst has longer lifetime and maintained sustained activity after being used for five cycles.

AB  - Birth weight (BW) is frequently considered as an indicator to detect possible restrictions of intrauterine development. This study evaluated the effect of breeding season (BS) across year: spring (SP), summer (SM), fall (FL) and winter (WT) upon the expression of BW. This meta-analysis considered records (n = 1,084) collected from a commercial herd kept under intensive conditions (22 degrees NL, 1,835 m). The definitive statistical model for BW analysis considered the independent variables kidding year, (KY), genetic group (GT), litter size (LS), gender (GN), breeding season (BS), kidding season (KS) plus the interactions (KY(star)GT) and (GN(star)BS). BW expression was affected (P<0.05) by KY, GN, LS, KS, and KY(star)GT. Interestingly, while BW expression was not affected (P>0.05) by kidding season, it was affected (P<0.05) by breeding season. The highest and lowest BW values were observed in SP and WN (3.34 vs. 3.10 kg; P<0.05), respectively. This physiological scenario could be the result of embryonic-fetal adaptive responses representing homeostatic adaptations due to alterations including doe nutritional status, available quantity and quality of food to both the embryo and the fetus as well as to a changing external environment.

AB  - Covariation between melanin-based colorations and other phenotypic attributes has been rarely measured simultaneously in males and females. Such covariations and mechanisms mediating them have crucial importance determining the signalling function of these coloured ornaments in the two sexes. We examined the role of four melanin-based coloured plumage patches as indicators of quality in both males and females of the sexually dimorphic and dichromatic Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus. Previous kestrel studies have focused on the size of melanin plumage patches in either males or females as indicators of individual quality. Here, we used spectrophotometric measurements of three plumage patches and the size of another plumage patch to investigate the information content of multiple plumage colour traits in male and female kestrels. We found that females with bright plumage in the head and with high UV chroma in black parts of the rump showed good body condition and innate immunity. In addition, laying date was significantly explained by the intensity of the brown in the head of females. Meanwhile, in males we only found that individuals with greyer rumps showed better innate immunity. Altogether, our results indicate that, irrespective of the mechanism promoting covariation between coloration and individual quality, melanin-based coloration can inform on individual quality in adult kestrels.

AB  - We have examined 21 samples of crude oils accumulated in the Middle Cambrian sandstone reservoirs from the Polish part of the Baltic region. All the crude oils have similar parameters and indices, which suggests generation from the same source rock. Evaporative fractionation and biodegradation processes were detected in oil collected from the B4-N1/01 borehole. All crude oils have high gravities and low-sulphur contents, less than 0.3 wt.%, which suggests that their source rock contained low-sulphur kerogen deposited in a elastic environment. A low asphaltenes content (below 0.3 wt.%) and high saturate/aromatic hydrocarbon ratios indicate long migration distances or high thermal maturities. The longest migration distance was probably attained by oils from the Zarnowiee and B16 deposits. The biomarker data indicate an algal origin for the source organic matter deposited under conditions of elastic sedimentation. The stable carbon isotope data support this observation. The maturity of the oils analysed varies from ca. 0.75 to ca. 1.05% on the vitrinite reflectance scale. Unlike the B6, B16, Debki and Zarnowiec accumulations, oils from the B3 and B4 accumulations reveal the lowest maturity.

AB  - This study presents an improved methodology for analysing atmospheric pollution around airports using Gaussian-plume numerical simulation integrated with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The new methodology focuses on streamlining the lengthy analysis process for Airport Environmental Impact Assessments by integrating the definition of emission sources, simulating and displaying the results in a GIS environment. One of the objectives of the research is to validate the methodology applied to the Athens International Airport, "Eleftherios Venizelos", to produce a realistic estimate of emission inventories, dispersion simulations and comparison to measured data. The methodology used a combination of the Emission Dispersion and Modelling System (EDMS) and the Atmospheric Dispersion and Modelling system (ADMS) to improve the analysis process. The second objective is to conduct numerical simulations under various adverse conditions (e.g. scenarios) and assess the dispersion in the surrounding areas. The study concludes that the use of GIS in environmental assessments provides a valuable advantage for organizing data and entering accurate geographical/topological information for the simulation engine. Emissions simulation produced estimates within 10% of published values. Dispersion simulations indicate that airport pollution will affect neighbouring cities such as Rafina and Loutsa. Presently, there are no measured controls in these areas. In some cases, airport pollution can contribute to as much as 40% of permissible EU levels in VOCs.

AB  - The records of wind-blown dust (i.e., loess) in China are some of the most important terrestrial records of past climate changes, stretching back over the last 10 Ma. In the paleoclimate literature, intervals of increased dust generation have been almost always interpreted as being associated with more intense or prolonged wintertime conditions. Here it is shown that, in accordance with modern observations, dust outbreaks in Asia are predominantly springtime phenomena. During spring, frequent cyclogenesis in the lee of the Mongolian Altai and the passage of strong cold fronts produce the intense windstorms that loft and entrain dust into the air. The meteorology governing such outbreaks is likely robust in past climates. Contrary to the common paleoclimate presumption, it is actually the breakdown of the Siberian High that permits the dust-producing windstorms to occur. The importance of cold fronts in generating such windstorms suggests that cooling of high-latitude climate during the Miocene, or during glacial intervals, might play a significant role in the signal recorded in the loess deposits. The unique springtime factors that generate dust storms are an example of why the common partitioning of Asian climate into a 'winter' and 'summer' monsoon is oversimplified and can be misleading.

AB  - A conservation project aimed at ecosystem restoration had several unforeseen effects on a colony of the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis in a small western Mediterranean island (Benidorm Island). The project included regulation of massive tourist visits to help restore the soil and autochthonous vegetation. However, gulls habituated rapidly to regulation of tourist activities, as nests located either close to or far from the main trail showed a similar hatching success. The quiet conditions produced by regulation seemingly facilitated a rapid colony increase. Partial removal of alien vegetation (Opuntia maxima) showed that gulls had a preference for sites with high vegetation cover because the growth of the colony was proportionally larger in well-vegetated plots. The pricking of a large number of gull eggs surprisingly coincided with a high reproductive success compared to the previous year, although indicators of food availability remained constant between years and the colony had decreased in numbers. Untreated nests were probably more successful because territory size for chicks increased and intraspecific predation decreased. Extreme care must be taken when planning ecosystem-wide management on islands with yellow-legged gull colonies, or other gull species locally considered as pests, to prevent unwanted effects.

TI  - Palaeosols on a fluvial terrace at Driekop, Northern Province, South Africa as indicators of climatic changes during the Late Quaternary
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - A study of an exposed fluvial terrace at Driekop (30 degrees 11'E, 24 degrees 38'S and 800 m above sea level) consisting of palaeosols, Stone Age implements and Iron Age fragments provides indicators of climatic changes during the Late Quaternary. This terrace, at least 12 m thick, with 15 stratigraphic layers (14 of these qualify as palaeosols on the basis of being buried) was analysed according to various methods. Layers were classified according to the diagnostic horizons and properties of the FAO-Unesco system. The genesis of the terrace and layers is ascribed to distinct events including periodicities involving deposition and erosion, as well as various intensities of pedogenesis. Whereas the evidence suggests that the cyclic pattern of erosion and deposition cannot be correlated with climatic changes of the past, it was ascertained that certain soil features (calcareousness, vertic, gleyic, etc.) could provide significant information in this regard. Some of the latter correlations are in agreement with present documented evidence on climatic changes during the Late Quaternary while others are of a contradictory nature. Radiocarbon dates for the calcareous materials, for example, range in age from c. 29.8, 24.1, 12.2 to 4.2 ka and have been regarded as representing conditions drier than present.

AB  - Observations of apparent cyclicity of climatic extremes - floods and droughts - are as old as civilization itself: As all climatological processes are driven by the redistribution of solar energy, it is natural to search for explanations of the observed anomalies in solar radiation. The only available long-term indicator of perturbations in solar radiation is the sunspot counts. In this presentation it is shown that there is an uncanny correspondence between cumulative deviations from the mean annual river flow for most river systems in South Africa and cumulative deviations from the mean annual sunspot numbers. This correspondence is not as apparent in the annual rainfalls over the catchments, however or in the Southern Oscillation Index. There is no visual evidence in the graphical relationships that the annual Southern Oscillation Index precedes annual river flow or precedes annual catchment rainfall as one would expect to be the case if the El Nino phenomenon was the cause and not a consequence of global climatic disturbances. As there is a stronger linkage between solar activity and annual river flow than between solar activity and annual rainfall, or between solar activity and the Southern Oscillation Index, it appears that perturbations in solar activity are affecting the phenomena that control the extreme events (runoff-producing rainfall, floods and droughts) rather than the mean conditions. More studies will be required to determine the validity of this conclusion.

AB  - Correlations are presented between model predictions for O-3-NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and afternoon concentrations of four ''indicator species'': NOy, O-3/NOy-NOx), HCHO/NOy, and H2O2/HNO3. The indicator species correlations are based on a series of photochemical simulations with varying rates of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and meteorology, Hydrocarbon-sensitive chemistry in models is shown to be linked to afternoon NOy > 20 ppb, O-3/(NOy-NOx) < 7, HCHO/NOy < 0.28, and H2O2/HNO3 < 0.4. Lower NOy and higher ratios correspond with NOx sensitive ozone. The correlation between NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator species remains, even when model emission rates and hydrocarbon/NOx ratios are changed by a factor of 2. Methods are developed for evaluating the goodness of fit between model NOx-hydrocarbon sensitivity and indicator values. Ozone chemistry is also analyzed in terms of fundamental properties of odd hydrogen, and theoretical criteria for the transition between NOx- and hydrocarbon-sensitive regimes are derived. A theoretical correlation between O-3 and H2O2 + NOy - NOx is developed as a way to extend rural O-3-NOy correlations into urban locations. Measured indicator values during pollution events in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and rural Virginia are used to illustrate the range of observed values under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), a widely used aromatic organophosphate flame retardant, is known to accumulate in organisms through water, air, and soil, consequently, causing toxicity. This study is the first to evaluate the acute and sub-chronic toxicities of TPhP to amphibians. In the acute toxicity analysis, the 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) for GS35 Hoplobatrachus rugulosus tadpoles was 2.893 mg/L, and the 10% effect concentration (EC10) was 289 mu g/L. After two weeks of exposure to low TPhP concentrations, the survival and metamorphosis rates of H. rugulosus tadpoles decreased, and the metamorphosis time was prolonged as the TPhP concentration increased. The threshold concentration that affected tadpole survival and metamorphosis time was 50 mu g/L and 100 mu g/L, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the condition factor and hepatic somatic index of the tadpole after metamorphosis; however, tadpole body mass and TPhP concentration were negatively correlated. Further, TPhP inhibited the expressions of Cu-Zn sod and cat, thereby reducing the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the tadpole liver. The threshold for affecting gene expression and enzymatic activity was 100 mu g/L. These findings provide significant insights on the stress ecology of aquatic organisms.

AB  - The theories of Jane Jacobs have gained momentum as a framework to address the challenges faced by presentday cities. Of special relevance is the concept of urban vitality as an indicator of street vibrancy and quality of life among city residents. This study aims to revisit her principles from an applied perspective by developing an updated index that measures the conditions for urban vitality as described in her most celebrated book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), and by also incorporating contemporary contributions made by recent literature on the topic. We develop a composite measure of 22 variables of the built and social environment, and we test it in the urban context of a peripherical and low-income district in Barcelona (Spain). Results show that urban vitality can be found in a wide variety of urban spaces such as compact fabrics and even housing projects, only when population density is combined with physical features that promote intense and diverse human activity. The methodological tool developed in this paper is intended to serve as a basis for future research as well as to guide public policies that aim to address some of the key challenges of contemporary urban agenda.

AB  - Climate change has increasingly attracted business attention over the last decade, focusing particularly on the eco-efficiency debate. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we contribute to the ongoing debate on the effects of environmental strategies on firm performance. We investigate this relationship by considering the relative greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) as a predictor of the eco-efficiency of firms' environmental strategies. GHG emissions are a direct indicator of the environmental performance and effectively measure the firm's efforts in mitigating the impacts related to its processes and products. Second, we investigate the drivers that lead to an increase in the firm's environmental impact under the conditions of increasing market performance by the firm, therefore paving the road to the concept of eco-effectiveness of corporate environmental strategies. To test our hypotheses, we use a sample of worldwide listed companies derived from the S&P 1200 list. A longitudinal analysis is run through generalized least squares regression models over the period 2004-2016. Results offer evidence of the direct relationship between the level of absolute emissions and market performance of the firm. Therefore, the findings have significant implications on the way we conceptualize corporate environmental sustainability and environmental strategies, shedding new light on the relation between environmental pressures and corporate growth.

AB  - Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are typically used to monitor microbial water quality but are poor representatives of viruses due to different environmental fate. Viral fecal indicators have been proposed as alternatives to FIB; however, data evaluating the persistence of emerging viral fecal indicators under realistic environmental conditions is necessary to evaluate their potential application. In this study, we examined the persistence of five viral fecal indicators, including crAssphage and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), and three bacterial fecal indicators (E. coli, enterococci and HF183/BacR287) in large-scale experimental ponds and freshwater mesocosms. Observed inactivation rate constants were highly variable and ranged from a minimum of -0.09 d(-1) for PMMoV to a maximum of -3.5 d(-1) for HF183/BacR287 in uncovered mesocosms. Overall, viral fecal indicators had slower inactivation than bacterial fecal indicators and PMMoV was inactivated more slowly than all other targets. These results demonstrate that bacterial fecal indicators inadequately represent viral fate following aging of sewage contaminated water due to differential persistence, and that currently used fecal indicator monitoring targets demonstrate highly variable persistence that should be considered during water quality monitoring and risk assessment.

AB  - The Ceduna Sub-basin in the offshore Bight Basin of southern Australia is under-explored with no significant hydrocarbon discoveries. Validation of potential petroleum systems is limited to geochemical data from minor shows. Fluid inclusion (FI) analysis was used to investigate the possibility of hydrocarbon migration throughout the penetrated sedimentary sections. Low abundances of FIs were identified in sandstones from several intervals in the Gnarlyknots-1A and Greenly-1 wells, indicative of oils trapped along migration pathways. The trace quantities of oils contained within FIs were successfully analysed by the molecular composition of oil inclusions (MCI) technique. The Gnarlyknots-1A FI oil provides the first geochemical characterisation of oil generated in the central Ceduna Sub-basin. It originated from source rocks that contain both terrestrial and algal organic matter deposited in a sub-oxic environment. The biomarker signature of the Greenly-1 FI oil reflects its derivation from a fluvial-deltaic, clay-rich source rock containing predominantly terrestrial higher plant detritus deposited under oxic conditions. These results reveal that several Lower to Upper Cretaceous source rock intervals in the Tiger, Blue Whale and White Pointer supersequences have potentially generated hydrocarbons, a finding which significantly enhances the petroleum prospectivity of the Bight Basin.

AB  - As a natural hazard, flood can cause a significant damage to buildings. Buildings are one of the important components of an economy which are providing the necessary space for human activities. In this regard, any considerable changes to their serviceability affect living condition of people locally, regionally, and even globally. Thus, building damage analysis forms a crucial part of a flood risk analysis. This review paper provides an insight into flood damage analysis for a building structure and contents: past works, current state, and required improvements. The discussed buildings include residential, commercial, and industrial types. The methods are divided into two main categories: (1) using real data and empirical models, and (2) using what-if analysis and analytical models. Differences in damage analysis of a building structure and its contents are explained in a separate section. Flood factors influencing the damage to a building structure and its contents are presented. How a method considers some of those flood factors is described. Limitations and shortcomings of each method alongside their advantages and strength are discussed. Lack of reliable data for both model construction and validation is one of the main issues with the methods in both categories. Inability to convey the uncertainty is the other main issue identified in the literature.

AB  - Integrated waste biomass gasification with cogeneration heat and power (CHP) is an attractive method for high efficiency electricity generation. It not only involves wastes as fuel but also helps in reduction of releasing pollutant gasses to the atmosphere. In this research, a simulation model is developed to assess performance and environmental impacts of producing electricity from gasifying of organic wastes in Iceland: garden, timber/wood, and paper mixed wastes. The objectives are to find the optimal operating conditions to make the highest electrical efficiency and the evaluation of global warming (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication (EP) potentials in regard to the environmental impact of the system. Moreover, the environmental assessment for the integrated waste gasification and CHP is compared with waste incineration in a conventional and currently running system. Our results show that the electricity production from waste gasification technology appears to be more environmentally friendly than waste direct combustion in all impact categories considered. Among the systems, timber and wood waste is the most beneficial from performance and environmental perspectives. The 1 kW h electricity production from timber through gasification would lead to a GWP of 0.07 kg CO(2)eq, AP of 0.09 kg SO(2)eq, and EP potential of 0.36 kg NO(3)eq. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The cultivation of adaptive varieties of grain crops is the main principle of organic agriculture, allowing to reduce the impact of negative anthropogenic factors on the environment and provide the population with environmentally friendly products. As a result of many years of study of spring wheat and barley varieties in the Volga-Vyatka region, the degree of modification (39.2-55.1%) and genotypic (16.4-18.0%) yield variability was revealed. Barley varieties were characterized by a higher average yields (3.60-5.50 ton/ha) and a reaction to the conditions of the year (coefficient of variation 25.2%) than wheat cultivars (2.62-3.71 ton/ha; 19.7%). In order to develop a regional strategy of breeding for environmental sustainability, a comparative assessment of several methods of calculating adaptive reactions was carried out. As a result, the most informative were the "indicator of cultivar level and stability" (PUSS), as well as the widely used "genotype variation coefficient on medium" (V, %), "plasticity" (b(i)), and "phenotypic stability" (S, %). Barley yield capacity was significantly positively correlated with homeostasis; high productivity in wheat was associated with increased plasticity. A systematic approach to the analysis of adaptive reactions has highlighted high-yield and environmentally sustainable cultivars of wheat (U-80,.-79, P-57, Nagrada) and barley (Belgorodsky 100, 346-09, 52-12).

AB  - Rapid changes in high-latitude hydroclimate have important implications for human societies and environment. Previous studies of different regions have indicated better agreement between climate model results and observation data for the thermodynamic variable of surface air temperature (T) than for the water variables of precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (R). Here we compare climate model output with observations for 64 Nordic and Arctic hydrological basins of different sizes, and for the whole region combined. We find an unexpectedly high agreement between models and observations for R, about as high as the model-observation agreement for T and distinctly higher than that for P or ET. Model-observation agreement for R and T is also consistently higher on the whole-region scale than individual basin scales. In contrast, model-observation agreement for P and ET is overall lower, and for some error measures also lower for the whole region than for individual basins of various scales. Region-specific soil freeze-thaw bias of climate models can at least partly explain the low model-observation agreement for P and ET, while leaving modeled R relatively unaffected. Thereby, model projections for this region may be similarly reliable and directly useful for large-scale average conditions of R as of T.

AB  - Animal welfare scientists actively seek reliable and practical metrics that can serve as indicators of animal welfare for use with agricultural, laboratory and zoo-housed animals. Behavioural diversity as a welfare concept originated from early welfare scientists linking poor animal welfare with a high proportion of time spent engaged in stereotyped behaviours and little expression of behaviours that would be expected under wild, or natural conditions. Recently, the concept of behavioural diversity as a welfare indicator has been widely adopted and is frequently quantified by the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (H-index). However, the H-Index is fraught with theoretical and mathematical limitations when applied to animal welfare. Four key problems with this metric are demonstrated: the metric's responsivity to the size of the behavioural repertoire and the underlying assumption that larger behavioural repertoires reflect better welfare, the sensitivity of the metric to arbitrary decisions about the resolution of behavioural categories, the fact that the calculation of the metric is agnostic to the valence of behaviours, and the metric's susceptibility to the common practice of excluding some behavioural categories. Moving forward, we recommend focusing on validated welfare measures that are sensitive to valence when evaluating animal welfare.

AB  - Tongmai Yangxin Pill (TMYX) is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of angina and arrhythmia. Although its clinical application is extensive, and the curative effect is significant, little information is available on the molecular biological basis and therapeutic mechanism of TMYX for the treatment of stable angina. In this study, we analyzed serum samples of clinical patients collected from seven different clinical units in China after oral administration of TMYX using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS). Multiple statistical analysis including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), were used to examine metabolite profile changes in serum samples. After TMYX treatment, 10 biomarkers were reversed to the normal conditions. The above biomarkers were mainly involved in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation. These results suggested that TMYX exerted therapeutic effects by improving myocardial energy supply disorder and amino acid dysfunction, and attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation. The present study, as the first multicenter clinical study which reveals the molecular biological basis and therapeutic mechanism of TMYX on stable angina, can provide objective indicators for efficacy evaluation of TMYX on stable angina. And it also lays a foundation for the use of TMYX clinically.

AB  - The organic Rankine cycle is capable of converting the low-temperature waste heat into electricity. The commonly used working fluid R245fa will be phased out in the near future because of the significant impact to climate change. In that case, a new refrigerant R1233zd(E) with extremely low GWP is proposed as an environmental friendly substitute in this paper. The investigation is processed with four steps: firstly, a thermodynamic analysis was carried out for prior prediction of the applicability of R1233zd(E) as an alternative to R245fa; secondly, an experimental comparison between two refrigerants was implemented under a design of extensive operating conditions; Afterwards, experimental results were presented. Differences in expansion and evaporation procedure based on three non-dimensionless indicators were analyzed; Eventually, a multi-objective optimization guidance involved with aforementioned indicators was proposed. Comparing the maximum cycle thermal efficiency, R1233zd(E) leads to approximately 3.8% higher than R245fa. Comparing the maximum output electrical power, R1233zd(E) leads to 4.5% better than R245fa. R1233zd(E) is proven as an appropriate alternative to R245fa based on current study. Prediction precision of the volume ratio dependent curves of filling factor and isentropic effectiveness are within 1.2% and 2.7%, which can be used to model a certain expander in optimization procedure.

AB  - With the increasing deployment of photovoltaic (PV) sources in the power grid and their contribution to power generation, it is imperative to obtain accurate models for the reliability and stability of these plants. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for reliability assessment for the different structures involved in the implementation of PV plants, in which the failure rate of system components is calculated using the FIDES Guide standard, taking into account environmental conditions such as radiation curves, temperature, and humidity. Failure rates of the insulated gate bipolar transistor and converter capacitor were found to be greater than other components. After precise calculation of failure and repair rates, the probability of functioning in three states of full generation, partial failure, and down was obtained through Monte Carlo simulations. Considering the effect of the system's structure on its stability, the reliability of the system can be increased by adding inverter paths to its structure. Several such structures are proposed, and the most economical design is identified by analyzing load duration curves to obtain the energy loss in each configuration. The proposed algorithm was implemented in Isfahan University's 20 kW PV power plant. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in design and evaluation of economic system structures.

AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) play an important role in the health of an infant as substrate for beneficial gut bacteria. Little is known about the effects of HMO composition and its changes on the morbidity and growth outcomes of infants living in areas with high infection rates. Mother's HMO composition and infant gut microbiota from 33 Gambian mother/ infant pairs at 4, 16, and 20 weeks postpartum were analyzed for relationships between HMOs, microbiota, and infant morbidity and growth. The data indicate that lacto-N-fucopentaose I was associated with decreased infant morbidity, and 3'-sialyllactose was found to be a good indicator of infant weight-for-age. Because HMOs, gut microbiota, and infant health are interrelated, the relationship between infant health and their microbiome were analyzed. While bifidobacteria were the dominant genus in the infant gut overall, Dialister and Prevotella were negatively correlated with morbidity, and Bacteroides was increased in infants with abnormal calprotectin. Mothers nursing in the wet season (July to October) produced significantly less oligosaccharides compared to those nursing in the dry season (November to June). These results suggest that specific types and structures of HMOs are sensitive to environmental conditions, protective of morbidity, predictive of growth, and correlated with specific microbiota.

AB  - The first open-sea (non-coastal) Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Argentina was created in 2013 (and named "Namuncura"), at Burdwood Bank, an undersea plateau located about 200 km south from Malvinas/Falkland Islands, SW Atlantic Ocean. This contribution represents the most recent and complete checklist of benthic organisms (mainly mega and macrofauna) that summarized 240 taxa collected at three sites in the mentioned area. The benthic richness here documented largely exceeds the values coming from other productive areas in Argentinean waters. Faunistic composition was different among the sites, although several species were shared. Bryozoans presented the highest richness compared to the other groups, followed by mollusks and sponges. These data represent valuable information and a very helpful starting point for incoming research, conservation efforts and management. It is essential to establish the spatial distribution of indicator taxa, like corals, sponges and bryozoans, to better attempt at the protection of benthic biodiversity in this rich Argentinean marine system. This is a key issue considering the notable extension of the MPA compared to other areas in Argentina, the bathymetric variations, particular oceanographic conditions and different fishing circumstances within the area.

AB  - The present study investigated the influence of the influent concentration of substrate, feeding time and temperature on the production of biohydrogen from cheese whey in an AnSBBR with liquid phase recirculation. The highest hydrogen yield (0.80 molH(2).molLactose(-1)) and productivity (660 mLH(2) L-1 d(-1)) were achieved for influent concentrations of 5400 mgDQO L-1. No significant difference was noted in the biological hydrogen production for the feeding time conditions analyzed. The lowest temperature tested (15 degrees C) promoted the highest hydrogen yield and productivity (1.12 molH(2) molLactose(-1) and 1080 mLH(2) L-1 d(-1)), and for the highest temperature (45 degrees C), hydrogen production did not occur. The indicator values for the hydrogen production obtained with this configuration were higher than those obtained in other studies using traditional configurations such as UASBr and CSTR. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the majority of the analyzed clones were similar to Clostridium. In addition, clones phylogenetically similar to the Lactobacilaceae family, notably Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and clones with similar sequences to Acetobacter indonesiensis were observed in small proportion in the reactor.

AB  - Optimization of the synthesis of cross-linked macroporous polymer impregnated with hydrous iron oxide and post-process of obtained material by application of freeze/drying technique, produces high performance adsorbent applicable for efficient arsenic removal. Characterization and analysis of adsorbent performances encompass material characterization, equilibrium and kinetic study, influences of interfering ions and modeling of adsorption data in ion free and competitive conditions. Kinetic study, i.e. fitting by Weber-Morris model and single resistance mass transfer model predicts intra-particle diffusion as a rate-controlling step. Thermodynamic parameters indicate endothermic, feasible and spontaneous nature of adsorption process. Competitive kinetic study in the presence of interfering ions shows low detrimental effect on both capacity and kinetic of arsenic removal. Visual MINTEQ modeling software was used for the prediction of adsorbent performances and interfering ion influences. Preliminary fixed-bed column study was accomplished by the use of Bohart-Adams, Yoon-Nelson, Thomas and Modified dose-response model.

AB  - Commensal rodents are some of the main vertebrate pests in urban areas; however, knowledge about factors that favor them at large scales is scarce. We studied spatial and temporal variations in rodent infestation levels at the whole city scale using the complaints of rodent sightings and questionnaire surveys to city neighbors. Demographic, socio-economic, and environmental characteristics handled with a geographic information system were evaluated as possible indicators of rodent infestation. The number of rodent sightings was lower in months with low mean temperature with two months time lag and higher in areas with high number of meat and metal industries. Rodent infestation estimated by the questionnaire survey showed spatial autocorrelation defining large areas with similar infestation levels. It decreased when the apartment density increased, while increased when the proportion of area occupied by shantytowns, the density of meat industries, and the proportion of area occupied by moderate urban development increased. Rodent control programs at the whole city level would have better results if public health pest agencies and/or governments will focus the efforts on areas with more precarious conditions as well as the industrial areas in the cold season when have lower rodent abundances.

AB  - This study aimed to identify robust indicators that summarize the respective importance of ontogeny and environmental constraints in tree development. In the proposed approach, tree growth data correspond to the retrospective measurement of annual shoot characteristics (e.g. length, number of branches) along the main stem. We applied segmentation models to identify tree growth phases. These segmentation models, which are hidden semi-Markov chains, were compared with simple hidden Markov chains that correspond to the environment-driven development assumption. This statistical modelling approach was applied to both evergreen (Corsican pine and silver fir) and deciduous (sessile oak and Persian walnut) tree species growing in contrasted conditions ranging from managed forest stands to unmanaged understoreys. Growth phase duration distributions estimated within these segmentation models characterize the respective importance of ontogeny and environmental constraints in tree development at the population scale and have very contrasted characteristics in terms of shape and relative dispersion between ontogeny-driven and environment-driven tree development. These characteristics may change over tree life, reflecting changes in tree competition. Growth phase duration distributions summarize the joint trajectory of tree ontogeny and environment without requiring tree growth follow-up data for their estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The response of larval aquatic insects to stressors such as metals is used to assess the ecological condition of streams worldwide. However, nearly all larval insects metamorphose from aquatic larvae to winged adults, and recent surveys indicate that adults may be a more sensitive indicator of stream metal toxicity than larvae. One hypothesis to explain this pattern is that insects exposed to elevated metal in their larval stages have a reduced ability to successfully complete metamorphosis. To test this hypothesis we exposed late-instar larvae of the mayfly, Centroptilum triangulifer, to an aqueous Zn gradient (32-476 mu g/L) in the laboratory. After 6 days of exposure, when metamorphosis began, larval survival was unaffected by zinc. However, Zn reduced wingpad development at concentrations above 139 mu g/L. In contrast, emergence of subimagos and imagos tended to decline with any increase in Zn. At Zn concentrations below 105 mu g/L (hardness-adjusted aquatic life criterion), survival between the wingpad and subimago stages declined 5-fold across the Zn gradient. These results support the hypothesis that metamorphosis may be a survival bottleneck, particularly in contaminated streams. Thus, death during metamorphosis may be a key mechanism explaining how stream metal contamination can impact terrestrial communities by reducing aquatic insect emergence.

AB  - Eutrophication can shift lakes from a clear, macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid, algae-dominated state, and different habitat condition supports different fauna. Macrozoobenthos are good indicators of water environment, and studies on macrozoobenthic assemblage characteristics can help us to know which state a lake is in, thus provide the basis for its eutrophication control. In this study, a systematic investigation on macrozoobenthos was conducted in 17 Yangtze-isolated lakes to explore the macroecological laws of macrozoobenthic assemblages. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) revealed that variance of benthic assemblage structure occurred in two types of lakes. In macrophytic lakes, altogether 51 taxa of macrozoobenthos were identified. The average density and biomass of total macrozoobenthos were 2231 individuals.m(-2) and 1.69 g dry weight.m(-2), respectively. Macrozoobenthic assemblage was characterized by dominance of scrapers (i.e. gastropods). In algal lakes, altogether 20 taxa of macrozoobenthos were identified. The average density and biomass of total macrozoobenthos were 2814 individuals.m(-2) and 1.38 g dry weight.m(-2), respectively. Macrozoobenthic assemblage was characterized by dominance of collector-gatherers (i.e. oligochaetes). Wet biomass of submersed macrophytes (B-Mac) and phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) were demonstrated as the key factor structuring macrozoobenthic assemblages in macrophytic and algal lakes, respectively.

AB  - Introduction The suitability of vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide for the decontamination of different-sized narrow cavities and complex geometrical structures were investigated in this paper.
   Methods A cavity test block was used, and cavities made from different materials were tested with variable entrance heights and cavity depths. At the end of each cavity, biological indicators were exposed as a microbiological challenge for vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide penetration. Within this study, the test block with the biological indicators was subjected to different decontamination cycles in a production isolator. Inoculation level, cycle length, hydrogen peroxide, and water concentration were varied.
   Results The ratio of cavity entrance height to depth was found to be critical for decontamination success by biological indicators exposed inside the cavities. The higher the ratio, the more spores could be inactivated. Inactivation is also effected by exposure time and hydrogen peroxide concentration.
   Conclusion The results indicate that the entrance height of the cavities should not be smaller than 6 mm and the cavity depth should not exceed 30 mm. If smaller cavities cannot be avoided, high peroxide concentration (800 ppm) and prolonged cycle times were shown to significantly enhance the penetration into dead-ended cavities under diffusive conditions.

AB  - This study aims at (1) detecting the main agricultural land-use/land-cover (LULC) trends that have occurred across the Alps since the 19th century and (2) assessing how landscape-scale biodiversity is affected by spatiotemporal LULC patterns. In a representative analysis, 35 municipalities covering the principal types of environmental, agro-economic and political conditions in the Alps were investigated. Based on historical maps and aerial photographs the LULC trends were determined using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Data on the plant species richness of the occurring LULC classes were derived from phytosociological literature. Finally, land-cover and floristic data were used to calculate indicators for the three aspects of alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity.
   Five main LULC trends could be found. Areas with grassland farming either experienced (1) the abandonment of grassland or (2) continuous grassland use. Areas with mixed agriculture either underwent (3) a specialisation in grassland farming, (4) a specialisation in vine and fruit cultures or (5) the continuous use of arable fields. Vine and fruit farming along with land abandonment and urban sprawl had the most negative impact on all aspects of landscape-scale biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper analyses the impact of road transportation on emissions of three toxic air pollutants, namely carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC), in selected OECD countries for the years 1995-2005. The theoretical framework stems from the Pressure-State-Response (P-S-R) model introduced by the OECD, which served as a tool both for modelling the relationship to be studied and for defining comparable indicators to be used in a cross-section time-series setting. The classic P-S-R model was extended and arranged in an original way in order to include the role of transport as well as the effects of economic performance and social progress variables. Hence, among the determinants of air quality not only the pressures exerted by transport infrastructures and vehicle fleet were considered but also indicators of income level, income inequality, health conditions and urbanization. Moreover the ratification of international treaties for the emissions reduction was taken as an indicator of the response by a country to the demand for environmental protection and safety. In the framework of models for panel data, a Hausman-Taylor model was estimated where the unobserved, time-constant and country-specific term was assumed to account for a sort of environmental awareness.

AB  - The 'good genes' hypothesis predicts that males advertise their quality with different sexual ornaments and that females are able to recognize the genetic quality of males by evaluating these characteristics. In the present study, we investigated the parental effects on offspring performance (feeding and swimming ability of newly-hatched larvae) and examined whether male ornamentation indicates offspring success in performance trials of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus Linnaeus). Offspring first-feeding success had a strong paternal effect and it was also positively correlated with the size of male breeding tubercles, indicating that breeding ornamentation of males can function as an honest indicator of their genetic quality. In addition, the observed positive correlation between male tubercle size and condition factor suggests that highly ornamented males are efficient foragers and that this trait may have a heritable basis. By contrast to feeding success, only a maternal effect was found in the swimming ability of the larvae. Clear family-specific differences observed in both measures of performance strongly suggest that parental identity may have important effects on larval survival in the wild.

AB  - Effect of tri-n-butyltin (TBT), an environmental pollutant, on intracellular Zn2+ concentration was tested in rat thymocytes to reveal one of cytotoxic profiles of TBT at nanomolar concentrations using a flow cytometer and appropriate fluorescent probes. TBT at concentrations of 30 nM or more (up to 300 nM) significantly increased the intensity of FluoZin-3 fluorescence, an indicator for intracellular Zn2+ concentration, under external Ca2+- and Zn2+-free condition. Chelating intracellular Zn2+ completely attenuated the TBT-induced augmentation of FluoZin-3 fluorescence. Result suggests that nanomolar TBT releases Zn2+ from intracellular store site. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide also increased the FluoZin-3 fluorescence intensity. The effects of TBT and hydrogen peroxide on the fluorescence were additive. TBT-induced changes in the fluorescence of FluoZin-3 and 5-chloromethylfluorescein, an indicator for cellular thiol content, were correlated with a coefficient of -0.962. Result suggests that the intracellular Zn2+ release by TBT is associated with TBT-induced reduction of cellular thiol content. However, chelating intracellular Zn2+ potentiated the cytotoxicity of TBT. Therefore, the TBT-induced increase in intracellular Zn2+ concentration may be a type of stress responses to protect the cells. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A novel assay was developed for the measurement of nitric oxide. The proposed method is based on fluorescence, using a fluorophore-heme dual functionality probe (FHP). The heme group can serve as an effective NO-trap, clue to its very fast reaction with NO and the high stability of the resulting complex. Since the heme is connected with a fluorophore as a part of the FHP dual-functionality probe, the heme can quench the fluorophore fluorescence, under certain conditions, by a singlet-singlet energy transfer mechanism. The proposed method was tested using myoglobin covalently modified by a stilbene label. The change in emission intensity of the stilbene fragment, versus an increasing concentration of NO precursors, clearly demonstrated the spectral sensitivity required to monitor the formation of a heme-NO complex in a concentration range of 10 nM-2 mu M. Furthermore, the new methodology for NO measurement was also found to be an effective assay using tissues from rabbit and porcine trachea epithelium. The measured NO flux (in an initial time interval) in tissue sample from rabbit trachea epithelia and porcine trachea epithelia is similar to 7.9 x 10(-12) mol/s x g and similar to 3.0 x 10(-12) mol/s x g respectively.

AB  - Open-ocean or offshore aquaculture has attracted recent controversy for its potential environmental impacts and proposed expansion in the USA. Organic enrichment of benthic marine communities has been documented extensively under nearshore fish farms-primarily from fish feces and feed pellets-but relatively few studies have examined the effects of deeper, offshore operations. In this study, we investigate the effects of a 6 mo non-operational fallow period on benthic invertebrate communities surrounding a commercial offshore fish farm. Polychaete species diversity and community structure were analyzed at distant reference sites and farm-adjacent affected sites before, during and after the fallow period. The relative abundances of 3 polychaete indicator species for organic enrichment were also analyzed. During the fallow period, community structure at affected sites became more similar to communities at distant reference sites. Additionally, the sudden disappearance of enrichment indicator species at previously affected sites during the fallow period further suggests the beginnings of a recovery. However, species diversity did not increase significantly during the fallow period, indicating that the affected communities had not been fully restored to pre-culture or distant reference conditions, This study demonstrates the potential environmental benefits of scheduled fallow periods or crop rotations in offshore aquaculture.

T2  - BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Sustainability of building construction and its services is increasingly drawing attention. In this respect CIBSE has issued a number of calls to industry. Solar water heating systems are now economically competitive and are being used throughout the world. Following earlier work of the present authors on the life cycle assessment (LCA) for building components,(1,2) this work presents a monetary, energy usage and environmental impact assessment for solar water heaters. It has been shown herein that for a developing country like Pakistan where large amounts of hot water are required within industry, solar water heating offers favorable payback periods on each of the above three counts. It has been estimated that under the tested conditions, the embodied energy payback period for the plain and finned heater is equivalent to 185 days and 169 days respectively. It has also been found that the amount of carbon released during the construction process of plain and finned water heaters is 27.9 kg and 29.7 kg respectively. Annual carbon saving for the plain and finned water heaters has been calculated to be equivalent to 59.5 kg and 69.6 kg respectively, which in turn gives a carbon payback period of 156 days and 171 days. The monetary payback period for the plain and finned heater has been found to be equivalent to 6.7 years and 6.1 years respectively.

AB  - Terbinafine hydrochloride (terbHCl) concentration on the site of infection with Microsporum cams is a very important indicator of drug effectiveness. Several chromatographic methods exist that can be used for the determination of terbHCl concentration in biological samples. A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method and a gas chromatographic (GC) method have been compared and critically evaluated for the determination of a terbHCl levels in cat hair. The sensitivity and the linearity of the previously developed HPLC method were 0.25 ng/mL and 0.25-3000 ng/mL, respectively. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.01 mug/g of terbHCl in cat hair, and reproducibility of 96.6% and recovery of 93.8% were achieved using appropriate sample pre-treatment and optimal chromatographic conditions. The sensitivity of the GC method, 25 ng/mL (LOQ 625 ppb). was much lower than that of the HPLC method. The GC method still enables determination of terbHCl in a range of concentrations in cat hair. The reproducibility of terbHCl for the cat hair samples was 95.3% and the recovery was only 70.0%. Both methods can be used for the evaluation of drug effectiveness in cats and both of them require only basic chromatographic equipment that can be found in most analytical laboratories.

AB  - Several million tons of sediments and various debris were transported to the north arm of the Saguenay Fjord and the Baie des Ha! Ha! following the torrential rains and accompanying flash flood of July 1996 in the Saguenay region (Quebec). The flood deposits covered the indigenous sediments and buried the benthic community. The objective of this work is to determine the best chemical and biological indicators of the changes that occurred in the benthic habitat of the fjord. The new sediment layer is poor in organic matter but rich in detrital carbonates and contains low mercury and lead concentrations reflecting the absence of industrial contamination. Ongoing geological processes leading to the re-establishment of steady-state conditions were evidenced by measurements of porosity, redox potential (Eh), and salinity of interstitial waters taken a few weeks and a few months after the events. The meiofauna were severely affected with a massive reduction of the average density of organisms relative to values recorded before the flood, but recolonisation was already in progress 1 year after the flood. Important losses of macrobenthic species were recorded in 1997 relative to 1996. However, the abundance and the diversity of the polycheate taxa were higher in 1997, indicating a recolonisation of the new sediment layer by pioneer species.

AB  - Surface sediments from 68 small lakes in the Alps and 9 well-dated sediment core samples that cover a gradient of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of 6 to 520 mu g TP l(-1) were studied for diatom, chrysophyte cyst, cladocera, and chironomid assemblages. Inference models for mean circulation log(10) TP were developed for diatoms, chironomids, and benthic cladocera using weighted-averaging partial least squares. After screening for outliers, the final transfer functions have coefficients of determination (r(2)), as assessed by cross-validation, of 0.79 (diatoms), 0.68 (chironomids), and 0.49 (benthic cladocera). Planktonic cladocera and chrysophytes show very weak relationships to TP and no TP inference models were developed for these biota. Diatoms showed the best relationship with TP, whereas the other biota all have large secondary gradients, suggesting that variables other than TP have a strong influence on their composition and abundance. Comparison with other diatom - TP inference models shows that our model has high predictive power and a low root mean squared error of prediction, as assessed by cross-validation.

AB  - Forests dominated by Fagus (beech) occur widely in the Northern Hemisphere. Tree species dominant together with beech vary in tolerance of understorey conditions. They are deciduous broad-leaved, evergreen broad-leaved or evergreen coniferous. The frequency and intensity of events that reduce the forest canopy cover are important determinants of the ratio of beech to other species in the canopy. For trees in the understorey and the canopy, stem diameter growth rate is determined by light regime and growing space which in turn are determined by canopy cover. We evaluated increase in stem diameter growth rate as an indicator of sudden reductions in canopy cover and canopy dynamics. We used tree-ring chronologies and calculated an index of growth rate increase (GI) to compare the canopy dynamics of 11 natural beech forests. Per site, the annual average value of GI poorly reflected the effects of dry or cool summers, and it clearly reflected events like tornados and hurricanes that removed substantial canopy cover. Among groups of sites average values of GI were significantly different. In the sites with a lower level of average GI, the establishment of the more shade tolerant tree and shrub species in the understorey was favoured, and subcanopy layers became more dense. On the other hand, higher levels of average GI allowed for more light demanding tree species to reach the canopy.

AB  - With the diversity of manipulator grasping methods and the complexity of the unstructured environment, the grasping planning of the target object is very complicated. However, the external factor for the manipulator grasping is primarily the external shape of the target object. Therefore, it is of great significance to establish a grasping system based on target shape analysis. This paper proposes a method for determining the grasping posture of manipulator based on shape analysis and force closure. The irregular or complex objects are reduced to a combination of some basic shapes. The 3D data points of the object are split into blocks and each part is fitted to sphere, cylinder or rectangle by a best-fit algorithm. This allows the grasping posture of the manipulator to be determined quickly. The grasping characteristics of the object are analyzed and the grasping surface is described qualitatively by means of a superellipse. The grasping of objects is simplified according to the stable grasping condition of force closure. The force spiral space for grasping defines the grasping quality of the manipulator. The best grasping posture is obtained by evaluating the indicators. This method eliminates complex training processes, reduces the complexity of robotic grasping and highly universal.

AB  - To prevent the preload loss, threadlockers are frequently used in threaded connections (e.g. to avoid self-loosening). Threadlockers are generally anaerobic adhesives and are commercially available either as semi-solid (pre-applied) or as liquid (to be applied just before tightening). Previous research deals with the frictional behavior of threaded joints with applied threadlocker. However, fasteners with applied threadlocker may sometimes operate at variable levels of temperature and humidity. A literature survey indicates there is a lack of data about the strength of joints with added threadlocker when they operate at different temperature/humidity levels with respect to conventional environmental conditions. In this research, the aforementioned issue has been tackled by means of an experimental campaign performed on liquid medium/high strength anaerobic adhesives (respectively, Loctite 243 and Loctite 270) applied to M10, 8.8 grade, zinc-coated screws. Following complete adhesive polymerization, the joints were aged in an environmental chamber, accounting for four combinations of temperature (room temperature - 90 degrees C) and humidity (20-90%) for one week. The joints were then untightened, sampling the breakaway torque. Statistical analyses of the data were carried out, to assess the influence of each parameter on the breakaway torque of the aged joint, thus deriving useful data for design.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to develop a system-level dynamic indicator for testing the long-term effectiveness of planned projects in a system. The indicator developed in this paper is a system dynamics model, which adds a dynamic component to the static structure of the flow matrix of Ecological Network Analysis (ENA). It offers the capability to tailor the model to the condition of individual systems.
   The paper creates a resilient energy-flow structure for Cone Spring Watershed and uses the table of results formulated in the article "Ecology-related resilience in urban planning - a complex approach for P ecs" (Kiss and Kiss, 2018), in which a method based on ENA was developed which helps with the creation of a resilient and sustainable system. A general system dynamics model - adding dynamics to an arbitrary static resilient structure - is developed first. The practical use of this dynamic indicator is demonstrated by means of an ecological example (Cone Spring Watershed) and a non-ecological example (the resilient and sustainable city strategy of P ecs, Hungary). The model is able to test the long-term effectiveness of the planned investment strategies and allocates the investment budget accordingly.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effect of heat stress on the physiology of dairy cows and to detect the relationship between rectal temperature (RT) and respiration rate (RR), heart rate (HR), and plasma concentrations of cortisol, thyroxine, and prolactin. During the experiment, 44 Holstein cows were allocated to two groups for each season. The average temperature-humidity index (THI) values were 55 +/- 2.31 in winter and 78 +/- 1.9 in summer. As the THI values increased from 55 to 78, RR rose by 35 inspirations per minute, HR by 3 beats per minute, and RT by 1.2 degrees C. In addition, the average concentration of cortisol increased from 19.30 to 21.04 nmol/L, and prolactin from 58.52 to 129.79 ngm/L, whereas free thyroxine decreased from 15.43 to 14.01 pmol/L. Plasma sodium and potassium concentrations were similar in the two seasons. These results confirmed that RT is an indicator of the response in dairy cows to hot environmental temperatures. However, they also showed signs of stress, which were reflected in higher levels of cortisol and in certain physiological responses.

AB  - The modeling of a new generation of agent-based simulation systems supporting pedestrian and crowd management taking into account affective states represents a new research frontier. Pedestrian behaviour involves human perception processes, based on subjective and psychological aspects. Following the concept of pedestrian environmental awareness, each walker adapts his/her crossing behaviour according to environmental conditions and his/her perception of safety. Different pedestrian behaviours can be related to subjective mobility and readiness to respond, and these factors are strongly dependent on the subjective interaction with the environment. Having additional inputs about pedestrian behaviour related to their perception processes could be useful in order to develop a more representative pedestrian dynamic model. In particular, the subjective perception of the safeness of crossing should be taken into consideration. In order to focus on the pedestrians' perception of safe road crossing and walking, an experiment in an uncontrolled urban scenario has been carried out. Besides more conventional self-assessment questionnaires, physiological responses have been considered to evaluate the affective state of pedestrians during the interaction with the urban environment. Results from the analysis of the collected data show that physiological responses are reliable indicators of safety perception while road crossing and interacting with real urban environment, suggesting the design of agent-based models for pedestrian dynamics simulations taking in account the representation of affective states.

AB  - Freshwater lakes and sediments need to be monitored continuously for environmental assessment and geochemical explorations. Lake sediments are major sinks for organic matter and for all geochemical elements. In the present study, total organic matter (TOC), nitrogen (TN), and geochemical analysis of major oxides was carried out on Yercaud Lake surface sediments, located at a higher elevation in South India to infer sediment distribution pattern and source for organic matter. Particle size distribution of lake surface sediments suggests that the sediments are predominantly silty sand and sandy silt, poorly to very poorly sorted and symmetrically skewed. TOC/TN ratio (6.54-12.65) reveal that the organic matter (OM) is derived from the in situ lake sources particularly from the vascular plants and lake biota accumulation. Weathering indices that fall from [chemical index of alteration (CIA)] 88.59-93.08 values and A-CN-K plot reflects intense chemical weathering of the bedrock exposures in the source area, which was accelerated under warmer and humid climate conditions in the sub-tropical regions. Al2O3/TiO2 ratio (6.94-26.62) indicates weathering particularly of the exposed charnockite rocks around the lake basin.

AB  - Facial appearance has been suggested to provide an honest cue of an individual's biological condition. However, there is little direct evidence that facial attractiveness reflects actual health. Here we tested if facial appearance is related with metabolic health biomarkers. Face photographs of 161 healthy, young women (M-age=28.59, SDage=2.34) were assessed in terms of perceived attractiveness and health. Metabolic health was evaluated based on levels of markers of lipid and glucose metabolism balance, liver functioning, and inflammation. BMI, testosterone (T), and estradiol (E2) levels were controlled. Facial attractiveness, but not health, was negatively related with lipid profile components detrimental to health (total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides) but not with relatively protective for health HDL. When controlled for BMI, E2, and T, only the relationship between attractiveness and triglycerides remained significant. Facial appearance was unrelated with glucose metabolism, liver functioning, and inflammatory markers. The results suggest, that for healthy women of reproductive age, such measures as BMI and sex hormone levels may be better predictors of attractiveness, compared to measures of metabolic health. Markers of lipid, glucose homeostasis, liver functioning or low-grade inflammation may be rather indicators of future health, of lesser importance in mating context, thus only modestly reflected in facial appearance.

AB  - Secondary metabolites (SMs) of medicinal plants are the material basis of their clinically curative effects. They are also important indicators for evaluating the quality of medicinal materials. However, the synthesis and accumulation of SMs are very complex, which are affected by many factors including internal developmental genetic circuits (regulated gene, enzyme) and by external environment factors (light, temperature, water, salinity, etc.). Currently, lots of literatures focused on the effect of environmental factors on the synthesis and accumulation of SMs of medicinal plants, the effect of the developmental growth and genetic factors on the synthesis and accumulation of SMs still lack systematic classification and summary. Here, we have given the review base on our previous works on the morphological development of medicinal plants and their secondary metabolites, and systematically outlined the literature reports how different environmental factors affected the synthesis and accumulation of SMs. The results of our reviews can know how developmental and environmental factors qualitatively and quantitatively influence SMs of medicinal plants and how these can be integrated as tools to quality control, as well as on the improvement of clinical curative effects by altering their genomes, and/or growth conditions.

AB  - Natural gas, a cleanest fossil fuel, has become more and more popular in recent periods because of its being used in commercial, industrial, power generation and residential applications. Because of its uses and economic implications, Natural gas prices are affected primarily by the market supply and demand functions. Factors like production, imports and storage inventory levels on the supply side influence gas prices. Increases in supply results in gas prices down while decreases in supply tend to push gas prices up. Increased gas prices tend to encourage increased gas production, imports and sales while declining gas prices result in the opposite effects. Factors, like weather, temperature, economic conditions and petroleum prices, play a key role in increases/decreases in demand. Our aim in this study is to analyze the Canadian and US natural gas markets, and for the purpose of prediction, to fit appropriate models to establish the functional relationship between Natural gas prices and covariates like energy demand and supply and economic growth indicators. We evaluate the statements of codependence among various cofactors contributing to gas prices. We consider a novel methodology of modeling the functional relationship by applying various piecewise polynomials and study the efficiency by carrying the prediction error analysis.

AB  - Microbial oils have been considered a renewable feedstock for bioenergy not competing with food crops for arable land, freshwater and biodiverse natural landscapes. Microalgal oils may also have other purposes (niche markets) besides biofuels production such as pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic and food industries. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) obtained from oleaginous microalgae show benefits over other PUFAs sources such as fish oils, being odorless, and non-dependent on fish stocks. Heterotrophic microalgae can use low-cost substrates such as organic wastes/residues containing carbon, simultaneously producing PUFAs together with other lipids that can be further converted into bioenergy, for combined heat and power (CHP), or liquid biofuels, to be integrated in the transportation system. This review analyses the different strategies that have been recently used to cultivate and further process heterotrophic microalgae for lipids, with emphasis on omega-3 rich compounds. It also highlights the importance of studying an integrated process approach based on the use of low-cost substrates associated to the microalgal biomass biorefinery, identifying the best sustainability methodology to be applied to the whole integrated system.

AB  - ContextThere is widespread consensus about the need for landscape sustainability but little agreement about how to define or measure it.ObjectivesThe aim of the paper is to present a systematic approach for measuring progress toward landscape sustainability goals.MethodsThe approach was developed based on existing literature and our experiences in applying the approach to support more sustainable agricultural landscapes. Examples applying this approach are summarized for case studies in the United States (U.S.) and Mexico.ResultsThe approach has six steps: the scope and objectives of the assessment are determined based on the particular context; indicators that alert pending concerns are selected and prioritized based on utility and relevance; baselines and targets are established for each indicator, and scenarios for consideration are determined; the indicator values are obtained and evaluated; trends in and tradeoffs among indicator values are analyzed; and good practices are developed, applied, and assessed.ConclusionsInsights gained from applying this approach suggest that designing sustainable landscapes depends on stakeholder engagement, effective communication, transparency and trust, timely monitoring, and continual improvement. Iterative application of the assessment approach builds capacity and promotes continual improvements in management practices, thus enabling timely responses to changing conditions while still progressing toward a set of locally defined goals.

AB  - Conventional economic argument suggests that higher economic growth and development is positively associated with increasing stock of natural assets of a country and/or region. However, empirical evidences suggest that the relationship between natural resource abundance and economic growth can be either detrimental, beneficial or both, depending on the time period of analysis and the variables used. The objective of this paper is to examine the relation between mineral resource extraction and various socio-economic development indicators in Odisha, India. The analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and OLS. The results reveal that the relationship between mineral resource dependence and various development indicators is mixed. Districts that are more dependent on minerals have experienced higher percapita income, reduction of both rural poverty and infant mortality rate. However, in terms of other development indicators such as presence of communication facilities and nutritional status of children, mining-districts have lagged behind. In order to overcome these problems large scale investment in education, health and good governance is necessary. In particular, effort must be made to improve the living conditions of indigenous communities residing in mining districts through targeted programs, especially in the areas of health, education, sanitation, and food security.

AB  - Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are vital indicators to healthy living and safe environments for child development. The aim of the study was to determine WASH status and practices in ECD centres located in low socio-economic areas of Nelson Mandela Bay during 2017. This cross-sectional study elicited responses from 46 ECD centres which had a total of 3,254 children and 172 caregivers. A structured questionnaire and visual observation were used. Using core WASH in schools' indicators (WinS) showed that despite improved water sources being available in 91% of the facilities, WinS for hygiene was poor. The study observed that 57% of the respondents had improved toilets accommodating both genders. In 29% of ECD centres, 6-10 children make use of a 'pottie' while in 9% of the cases, more than 20 children make use of one 'pottie'. The use of the bucket system was noted in 22% of the ECD centres. In 79% of the ECD centres, children wash their hands in a communal plastic bowl. Only 11% of the study population washed hands hygienically under a running tap or tippy tap. WASH conditions in the ECD centres in the study area require urgent attention and further investigation for practical solutions.

AB  - This work aims to develop a computationally effective electric circuit model to estimate the ventilation and heat transfer for walking human in the presence of natural convection. The ventilation circuit includes flow resistance, inductance, and electromotive force elements. It is coupled to an electric resistance circuit of heat flows to adjust the temperature difference inducing natural convection flow. The coupled ventilation and heat circuit models predicted both the segmental ventilation rate and heat loss from the arm at different walking and wind speeds. The developed model of the segmental ventilation and heat transfer from the clothed human segment was validated by performing experiments on a walking thermal manikin using tracer gas method. Good agreement was observed between the model predictions and the experiment at a maximum relative error of 10% lying within the standard deviation range. Results showed that the simplified ventilation-heat circuit models succeeded in estimating the natural convection effect at low computational cost. Moreover, it was shown that the effect of natural convection is more significant in walking at no wind than in windy condition. Accounting for natural convection effect increases the segmental ventilation and heat loss at low air permeability (0.02 m/s) by 68% and 20%, respectively.

AB  - Water-storage containers are common in households where access to water is scarce and often act as breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Bacteria in these containers may be important for attracting or repelling ovipositing mosquitoes. We hypothesized that bacterial community composition in water-storage containers would represent either inhibitory or suitable environmental conditions for mosquito larvae. To investigate this, we characterized the bacterial community composition in water-storage containers and correlated these communities to Aedes and Anopheles larval densities. Water samples were collected over two years from 13 containers in an Indian village and analyzed by high throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Comparisons of bacterial community composition between water with and without mosquito larvae showed that Xanthomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae were more common (P < 0.05) in absence of larvae, while Lachnospiraceae, Synechococcaceae, Alcaligenaceae and Cryomorphaceae were more common (< 0.05) in presence of larvae. Indicator analysis identified operational taxonomic units designated as CL500-29 marine group (Acidimicrobiaceae) and FukuN101 (Microbacteriaceae) for absence and presence of larvae, respectively. These results contribute to the understanding of which bacteria, directly or indirectly, can be linked to absence or presence of mosquitoes around households and set the basis for potential measures to be taken against these vector mosquitoes.

AB  - Sexual selection results in the evolution of exaggerated secondary sexual characters that can entail a viability cost. However, in species where sexual ornaments honestly reflect individual quality, the viability cost of secondary sexual characters may be overwhelmed by variation in individual quality, leading to expect that individuals with the largest secondary sexual characters show higher, rather than lower viability. Here, we used meta-analyses to test whether such expected positive relationship between sexual ornamentation and viability exists in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, which is one of the most studied model species of sexual selection under field conditions. We found a mean positive effect size of viability in relation to the expression of secondary sexual characters of 0.181 (CI: 0.084-0.278), indicating that in this species the more ornamented individuals are more viable, and therefore of high quality. Analyses of moderator variables showed similar effects in males and females, the H.r.rustica subspecies rather than others and tail length rather than other secondary sexual characters. Future research emphasis on other subspecies than the European one and secondary sexual characters than tail length may help identify the sources of heterogeneity in effect sizes.

AB  - Synovex (R) ONE is an extended-release implant containing the active ingredients estradiol benzoate and trenbolone acetate for use in beef steers and heifers. Trenbolone acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed in cattle to form 17 beta-trenbolone and its isomer, 17 alpha-trenbolone, which are further transformed to a secondary metabolite, trendione. As part of the environmental assessment for the use of Synovex ONE, data were generated to characterize the fate of 17 alpha-trenbolone, which is the principal metabolite found in cattle excreta, in the environment. A study was conducted to determine the degradation and transformation of [C-14]-17 alpha-trenbolone in 2 representative water-sediment systems under aerobic conditions. The same transformation products, 17b-trenbolone and trendione, were formed, principally in the sediment phase, in both systems. From the production of these transformation products, the 50% disappearance time (DT50) values of 17 beta-trenbolone and trendione were determined, along with the DT50 values of the parent compound and the total drug (17 alpha-trenbolone+17 beta-trenbolone+trendione). The DT50 values for the total system (aqueous and sediment phase) and for the total residues (17 alpha-trenbolone+17 beta-trenbolone+trendione) in the 2 systems were 34.7 d and 53.3 d, respectively.

AB  - Research on adjustment to chronic disease is critical in today's world, in which people are living longer lives, but lives are increasingly likely to be characterized by one or more chronic illnesses. Chronic illnesses may deteriorate, enter remission, or fluctuate, but their defining characteristic is that they persist. In this review, we first examine the effects of chronic disease on one's sense of self. Then we review categories of factors that influence how one adjusts to chronic illness, with particular emphasis on the impact of these factors on functional status and psychosocial adjustment. We begin with contextual factors, including demographic variables such as sex and race, as well as illness dimensions such as stigma and illness identity. We then examine a set of dispositional factors that influence chronic illness adjustment, organizing these into resilience and vulnerability factors. Resilience factors include cognitive adaptation indicators, personality variables, and benefit-finding. Vulnerability factors include a pessimistic attributional style, negative gender-related traits, and rumination. We then turn to social environmental variables, including both supportive and unsupportive interactions. Finally, we review chronic illness adjustment within the context of dyadic coping. We conclude by examining potential interactions among these classes of variables and outlining a set of directions for future research.

AB  - A label-free fluorescence assay has been developed for sensitive and selective detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by using poly(thymine) (poly T)-templated copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) as fluorescent indicator. In our design, ATP aptamer was split into two fragments, both of which were elongated with poly T strands that can be utilized as efficient template for the formation of copper nanoparticles through the reduction of copper ions by sodium ascorbate. In the presence of ATP, the two split aptamers could be dragged to form aptamer-ATP aptamer complex, which drew the poly T strands close to each other and induced a remarkable fluorescence enhancement of poly T-templated CuNPs. Thus, an elevated fluorescence enhancement of poly T-templated CuNPs was obtained with the increase in ATP concentration. Under optimized conditions, a good linear range for ATP detection was realized from 100 nM to 100 mu M with a detection limit of 10.29 nM. In addition, the application of this biosensing system in complex biological matrix was demonstrated with satisfactory results. This assay provided a simple, label-free, cost-effective, and sensitive platform for the detection of ATP.

AB  - Determining the spatiotemporal water quality patterns and their corresponding driving factors is crucial for lake water quality managements. This study analyzed hydrological data and concentrations of 11 water quality parameters, including total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), for water samples collected from 15 sampling sites between 2009 and 2014. The water quality of sites in the northern Poyang Lake-Yangtze River waterway was influenced by different environmental parameters compared to sites in central lake, especially for Chl-a concentration. All pollutant parameters were significantly higher in the river phase (water level <14 m) than in the lake phase (water level >14 m) (p < 0.05). These results were confirmed via principal component analysis, which identified three principal components that explained over 79% of the dataset variance. Among all the parameters related to climatic factors, eutrophication and organic pollution were the most important contributors in water quality. Dilution was the controlling factor that drove the seasonal variability in the water quality of the Poyang Lake, China. This work further indicated that regulating pollutant effluents in tributaries and water level within the lake could improve the water quality in Poyang Lake, which may give some impetus for water quality management.

AB  - Musk deer (Moschus spp.) are endangered due to high incidence of illegal hunting for musk and extensive habitat degradation. Musk deer farming may be an important way to conserve musk deer populations and as a method for the sustainable utilization of musk deer resources, but no assessment has been conducted on the level of domestication and the domestication potential of this species. An understanding of the basic behavior patterns and of the process of adaptation to captive conditions, particularly over successive generations, is vital in developing appropriate captive husbandry techniques for musk deer. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the behavioral patterns between wild-caught (WC) and captive-born (CB) musk deer to assess the degree of domestication of captive alpine musk deer. Focal animal sampling was used to record the behaviors of wild-caught and captive-born adult alpine musk deer at the musk deer farm of Xinglongshan National Nature Reserve, Gansu Province of China. The results showed no significant difference between wild-caught and captive-born musk deer in terms of the behavior indicators, and hence, little evidence of behavioral domesticity in captive individuals. In this regard, intensive farming of musk deer must be considered an interim means of conservation, rather than a long-term plan for species protection and musk utilization.

AB  - As in other crops, yield and quality in the potato is determined by the genotype x environment interaction; limited by seed, crop, and storage management; and reduced by weeds, pests, and diseases. Within the limiting factors, seed tuber quality is crucial, both in low- and high-input crops. If poor seed tubers are used in low- input crops, only low yields can be expected. If poor seed tubers are used in high-input crops, the crops will not take proper advantage of other inputs, such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides applied. At present, physical aspects, such as shape and presence of wounds, seed tuber size, health, and physiological age, are the main components of seed quality, impacting seed vigour. Physiological age is defined as the physiological status of a seed tuber at any time, determined by genotype, chronological age, and environmental conditions from tuber initiation until new plant emergence. This minireview summarizes the physiological age assessment methods and the effects of crop and storage environment and management on physiological age and future crop performance. Possible tactics to reverse physiological age effects are also discussed. More research is still needed to develop a reliable and predictable indicator or index which can relate physiological age to yielding potential.

AB  - Cores from the New River Lagoon in Belize have been analysed using a range of palaeolimnological proxies to reconstruct change since the latest Pleistocene. The combination of diatom and stable isotope analyses (Supported by mineralogical and major element data) indicate that the New River Lagoon has been a freshwater system throughout the period of record. For most of this time the lagoon has been hydrologically open, but there are indications that it may have become closed in the latest Pleistocene or very early Holocene. This may have been associated with a drier climate and lower sea level. Mid-Holocene records are consistent with those from elsewhere in the region, indicating a stable and moist climate. The late Holocene was marked by greater variability, but there is no clear evidence of any drying in the late Classic coincident with the Maya 'collapse' ca. AD 900. Our results indicate that the continuity Of Occupation at the Maya site of Lamanai on the shores of the New River Lagoon is consistent with continued access to freshwater during periods of regional climatic variability. The importance of conditions at individual sites when considering both system response and human Vulnerability to climate change is emphasised. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is the main legume crop of Mali, West Africa. It can be contaminated by aflatoxin, a natural toxin that can develop because of drought conditions at pre-harvest stage or because of temperature- and humidity-related factors that occur during post-harvest storage. Consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated peanut can cause liver diseases, such as jaundice, hepatitis or cancer. We present a case study for Mali, identifying weather- and satellite-based variables that could be used to indicate aflatoxin in peanut. Based on this monitoring and predicting, a warning may be issued against eating contaminated peanut to keep the public health from deteriorating. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites, derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, were averaged for the reproductive phase of peanut and examined for their relationship with the annual peanut yield, an indicator of drought and aflatoxin. The relationship was found to be moderate (R-2=0.56). The commencement and termination dates for the reproductive phase of peanut were determined by using a crop simulation model. Amounts of aflatoxin were measured for peanut samples collected from various locations across Mali and were found to be linked to the NDVI, total precipitation, and maximum temperature averaged over the reproductive phase of peanut.

AB  - Increased disturbance of terrestrial ecosystems in recent years for purposes of mineral extraction has created interest in development and optimization of reclamation methodologies for these lands. Currently, criteria for judging surface mine reclamation success, or progress toward reclamation goals, predominantly rely on aboveground indicators that fail to account for the abundance and composition of soil microbiota, an essential aspect of soil health. To test the utility of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biomarkers as indicators of reclamation progress, FAME bacterial, fungal, and total biomass biomarkers extracted from soil of surface mine reclamation sites of different ages and an adjacent undisturbed site were compared with other indicators of reclamation progress and ecosystem stability. Our results indicate that FAME microbial biomarkers and soil organic matter (SOM) contents were greatly impacted by disturbance. Discriminant analysis of FAME bacterial, fungal and total microbial biomass biomarkers, although clearly able to discriminate between disturbed and undisturbed ecosystems, indicated a trend towards the undisturbed condition with reclamation age. The ratio of FAME bacterial to fungal biomarkers reflected changes in other indicators of soil health (SOM, inorganic N concentration), suggesting that this ratio is a useful indicator of reclamation progress.

AB  - Eight diurnally active (06:00-23:00 h) subjects were adapted for 2 days to the room conditions where the experiments were performed. Blood sampling for adenosine metabolites and metabolizing enzymes was done hourly during the activity span and every 30 min during sleep. The results showed that adenosine and its catabolites (inosine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid), adenosine synthesizing (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and 5'-nucleotidase), degrading (adenosine deaminase) and nucleotide-forming (adenosine kinase) enzymes as well as adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP) undergo statistically significant fluctuations (ANOVA) during the 24 h. However, energy charge was invariable. Glucose and lactate chronograms were determined as metabolic indicators. The same data analyzed by the chi-square periodogram and Fourier series indicated ultradian oscillatory periods for all the metabolites and enzymatic activities determined, and 24-h oscillatory components for inosine, hypoxanthine, adenine nucleotides, glucose, and the activities of SAH-hydrolase, 5'-nucleotidase, and adenosine kinase. The single cosinor method showed significant oscillatory components exclusively for lactate. As a whole, these results suggest that adenosine metabolism may play a role as a biological oscillator coordinating and/or modulating the energy homeostasis and physiological status of erythrocytes in vivo and could be an important factor in the distribution of purine rings for the rest of the organism.

AB  - Benthic-algal distributions in the Yakima River, Washington, basin were examined in relation to geology, land use, water chemistry, and stream habitat using indicator-species classification (TWINSPAN) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Algal assemblages identified by TWINSPAN were each associated with a narrow range of water-quality conditions. In the Cascade geologic province, where timber harvest and grazing are the dominant land uses, differences in community structure (CCA site scores) and concentrations of major ions (Ca and Mg) and nutrients (solute P, SiO2 and inorganic N) varied with dominant rock type of the basin. In agricultural areas of the Columbia Plateau province, differences in phytobenthos structure were based primarily on the degree of enrichment of dissolved solids, inorganic N, and solute P from irrigation-return flows and subsurface drainage. Habitat characteristics strongly correlated with community structure included reach altitude, turbidity, substratum embeddedness (Columbia Plateau), large woody-debris density (Cascade Range), and composition and density of the riparian vegetation. Algal biomass (AFDM) correlated with composition and density of the riparian vegetation but not with measured chemical-constituent concentrations. Nitrogen limitation in streams of the Cascade Range favored nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae and diatoms with endosymbiotic blue-greens, whereas nitrogen heterotrophs were abundant in agricultural areas of the Columbia Plateau.

AB  - Suicidal behaviors (SBs) are often associated with impaired performance on neuropsychological executive functioning (EF) measures that encourage the development of more specific and reliable tools. Recent evidence could suggest that saccadic movement using eye tracking can provide reliable information on EF in depressive elderly. The aim of this study was to describe oculomotor performances in elderly depressed patients with SB. To achieve this aim, we compared saccadic eye movement (SEM) performances in elderly depressed patients (N = 24) with SB and with no SB in prosaccade (PS) and antisaccade (AS) tasks under the gap, step, and overlap conditions. All participants also underwent a complete neuropsychological battery. Performances were impaired in patients with SB who exhibited less corrected AS errors and longer time to correct them than patients with no SB. Moreover, both groups had a similar performance for PS latencies and correct AS. These preliminary results suggested higher cognitive inflexibility in suicidal patients compared to non-suicidal. This inflexibility may explain the difficulty of the depressed elderly in generating solutions to the resurgence of suicidal ideation (SI) to respond adequately to stressful environments. The assessment of eye movement parameters in depressed elderly patients may be a first step in identifying high-risk patients for suicide.

AB  - In low-cost Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), node localization in a noisy environment is a significant problem as additional hardware like GPS is avoided due to high cost. The pairwise distances between sensor nodes are estimated using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) because of the low computational complexity and cost-effectiveness. However, the RSSI distance estimates are rough and fluctuate owing to various environmental conditions like noise, interference, and fading. This results in non-Euclidean pairwise distance estimates. To compute the actual inter-node distances, we consider the manifold assumption that the nodes embedded in the low dimensional space apparently lie in an unknown high dimensional manifold. The inter-node distances can be estimated by reducing the dimension through manifold learning. This work proposes a localization technique based on Similarity-Based Ricci Flow Embedding (SBRFE), an unsupervised manifold learning method that reduces the non-Euclidean artefacts of a distance matrix and converts it into a Euclidean one. Each inter-node distance is considered independently, and the corresponding sectional curvature is updated iteratively till all the distances become Euclidean. Experiment results show that the SBRFE algorithm outperforms all the conventional manifold learning algorithms and can localize all the sensor nodes with an increased accuracy up to 94.55%.

AB  - Water catchment to subsidize agricultural activities is estimated at 70% of world consumption. In the western region of Bahia, the main agricultural center of the state, there is intensive use of water for the production of agricultural commodities. In regions with high water demand, quantification of the use of this resource can be performed using anthropic pressure indicators, such as the Water Footprint. Thus, this work determined the Water Footprint of the soybean, cotton, and corn crops produced in the western region of Bahia State. In order to determine the Water Footprint, data of the environmental characteristics and crop production in the region were used, were obtained from different Brazilian public and private institutions. The calculation of Water Footprint of the crops was performed by the sum of the green, blue, and gray components. The average Water Footprint between 2012 and 2017 for soybean corresponded to 1,972.3 m(3) t(-1), with cotton at 1,825.2 m(3) t(-1), and corn 512.4 m(3) t(-1). The analyses of the results and the comparison with the values of the Water Footprint of other regions demonstrate that the edaphoclimatic conditions of the western region of Bahia are propitious to the development of these crops.

AB  - Using potassium peroxodisulfate as an initiator and acrylic acid as a monomer, an acrylic acid oligomer was synthesized and then compounded with magnesium salt to form a non-silicone oxygen bleaching stabilizer. By investigating the effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, initiator concentration, monomer concentration, and magnesium salt dosage on product performance, the effect of stabilizers on linen yarn bleaching was analyzed. The synthetic conditions of oxygen bleaching stabilizer were determined by orthogonal test method, namely, acrylic acid monomer concentration 25%, initiator dosage 5%, oligomeric acrylic acid and magnesium salt compound ratio 5:1, reaction temperature 65 degrees C, reaction time 4 h. At this time, the chelated iron value of the product was as high as 239.314 mg/g, and the chelated calcium value also reached 145.000 mg/g. The dosage of the synthesized stabilizer were determined to be 4 g/L through indicators such as the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide and whiteness. The results showed that the environmentally friendly non-silicone oxygen bleaching stabilizer not only had a good ability to inhibit the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, but also provided bleached linen yarn with a superior degree of whiteness and less metal ion residue, which can effectively solve the "silicon scale" problem and improve the quality of the pre-treatmented products.

AB  - This paper presents new research on a lacustrine anoxic event (LAE). These data include stable carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)), pyrite sulfur isotope (delta S-34(py)), trace element and biomarker ratios from the Hongmiaozi Basin (North China) and unravel the response of continental lakes under the influence of early Aptian extreme climate conditions. According to the stratigraphic chronology (122-118 Ma) and carbon isotope correlations, terrestrial sediment was influenced by the early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE1a). The results show that the Xiahuapidianzi Group experienced a significant warming process under negative excursions in carbon isotopes due to the influence of increased carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)). The climate varied from warm and humid to hot and arid (high Sr/Cu, low Rb/Sr, calcareous mudstone), the evaporation and salinity increased (high Sr/Ba and B/Ga), and land input sources decreased (low Zr, Ti and Th). Moreover, high total organic carbon (TOC) content was source from bacteria, algae (n-alkanes), and euxinic depositional environments (Pr/Ph, Cu/Zn and U V Mo). In the stage of continuous carbon isotopes positive excursion, organic matter accumulated rapidly. A paleolake environment model has provided a better understanding of current global climate issues under global warming caused by increased carbon dioxide concentrations.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have been extensively applied in different industrial areas, mainly due to their antibiotic properties. One of the environmental concerns with AgNP is its incorrect disposal, which might lead to severe environmental pollution. The interplay between AgNP and plants is receiving increasing attention. However, little is known regarding the phytotoxic effects of biogenic AgNP on terrestrial plants. This study aimed to compare the effects of a biogenic AgNP and AgNO3 in Sorghum bicolor seedlings. Seeds were germinated in increasing concentrations of a biogenic AgNP and AgNO3 (0, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mu M) in a growth chamber with controlled conditions. The establishment and development of the seedlings were evaluated for 15 days. Physiological and morpho-anatomical indicators of stress, enzymatic, and non-enzymatic antioxidants and photosynthetic yields were assessed. The results showed that both AgNP and AgNO3 disturbed germination and the establishment of sorghum seedlings. AgNO3 released more free Ag+ spontaneously compared to AgNP, promoting increased Ag+ toxicity. Furthermore, plants exposed to AgNP triggered more efficient protective mechanisms compared with plants exposed to AgNO3. Also, the topology and connectivity of the correlation-based networks were more impacted by the exposure of AgNO3 than AgNP. In conclusion, it is plausible to say that the biogenic AgNP is less toxic to sorghum than its matrix AgNO3.

AB  - The species composition of diatoms and cyanobacteria of the periphyton of experimental synthetic polymer materials, which are anthropogenic waste products and damage marine coastal ecosystems, are presented for the first time. A vertical collector with polymer material samples was exposed in Karantinnaya Bay (the Black Sea) at a depth of 1 to 12 m from August 4 to September 18, 2018. A total of 94 taxa of Bacillariophyta (67) and Cyanobacteria (27) have been found. Two diatom and 15 cyanobacteria species have been detected in the Crimean coastal waters of the Black Sea for the first time. Benthic species are predominant, of which 74% are marine; two major groups are constituted by cosmopolites (58%) and arctic-boreal-tropical species (37%). In total, 32 species-indicators of saprobity are identified; among them, 21% are beta-mesosaprobiont diatoms living in the conditions of moderate organic pollution. The largest number of diatom and cyanobacteria species are detected on the surface of mesh collectors (48/19) and containers (40/7). These organisms actively participate in transforming and reorganizing the architectonics of fouling on the surface of the polymer samples. Thus, it is shown that synthetic materials may obtain novel biochemical properties, which can be used in the future in different areas of science and technology (medicine, biotechnology, etc.).

AB  - With the methods of factor analysis, the VAR model, and the GARCH model, selecting 11 indicators related to the agricultural production conditions and rural economy in Heilongjiang Province from 2012 to 2017 as the macroeconomic indicators, and 8 indicators related to credit risk management and asset quality supervision in Heilongjiang Province within the 72 months from 2012 to 2017 as the microeconomic indicators, this paper conducted empirical research on the risk measurement of mortgage loans on rural land contract and management rights in Heilongjiang Province. The VAR of the risks of mortgage loans on rural land contract and management rights was calculated with the VAR-GARCH (1, 1) model. The VAR line chart showed that the risks of mortgage loans on rural land contract and management rights in Heilongjiang Province were at a lower level in 2012, at a stably high level from 2013 to 2016, and then relieved to some extent in 2017. At the end of the article, it was suggested that the financial environment in Heilongjiang Province should be improved and banks' internal control should be strengthened so as to promote the smooth development of mortgage loans on rural land contract and management rights.

AB  - Body height is a life-history component. It involves important costs for its expression and maintenance, which may originate trade-offs on other costly components such as reproduction or immunity. Although previous evidence has supported the idea that human height could be a sexually selected trait, the explanatory mechanisms that underlie this selection are poorly understood. Despite extensive studies on the association between height and attractiveness, the role of immunity in linking this relation is scarcely studied, particularly in non-Western populations. Here, we tested whether human height is related to health measured by self-perception, and relevant nutritional and health anthropometric indicators in three Latin-American populations that widely differ in socioeconomic and ecological conditions: two urbanised populations from Bogota (Colombia) and Mexico City (Mexico), and one isolated indigenous population (Me'Phaa, Mexico). Results showed that self-reported health is best predicted by an interaction between height and waist circumference: the presumed benefits of being taller are waist-dependent, and affect taller people more than shorter individuals. If health and genetic quality cues play an important role in human mate-choice, and height and waist interact to signal health, its evolutionary consequences, including cognitive and behavioural effects, should be addressed in future research.

AB  - It is well-known that camelina oil, obtained from Camelina sativa seeds is rich in fatty acids, predominantly linolenic acid and is used successfully in pharmaceutical and cosmetic therapies. It is remarkable that this species has a great adaptability to environmental conditions, being able to cultivate it on agricultural parcels and polluted soils.
   The goal of this work is to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative differences of three types of camelina oils, obtained from varieties grown in Romania: GP 202-Spanish provenance, Camelia and Madalina, both Romanian provenance. The effect of soil fertilization on the quality of the seeds /oil obtained from 3 varieties of camelina was tested, the control being the unfertilized Camelina variety. The following parameters have been evaluated: seed moisture, cold oil extraction yield, certain physico-chemical oil indicators and percent quantitative composition of individual and total fatty acids. Remarkable is the total fatty acid content of the oil that varies between 75.87 g% for the unfertilized Madalina variant and 81 g% for the fertilized GP-202 variant. Taking in consideration the results for all the studied parameters, it can be concluded that the Mack Vinci variety is very similar to the other two, and fertilization contributes insignificantly to the improvement of the quality of the obtained oil.

AB  - The tremendous amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into emerging nations has attracted worldwide attention. These economies are at a same stage of development with similar social, economic and other conditions, but their institutional environment can act as a differentiator in affecting FDI location within these emerging economies. So, this article examines the role of institutional mechanisms in influencing their inward FDI by employing broad-based indicators of institutional environment. The article employs panel data regression (fixed effects) to test the impact of institutional indicators and other variables on FDI inflows and stock of 23 emerging economies from 2006 to 2015. Three indices have been constructed for this purpose, using the methodology of principal component analysis and composite index, from 24 institutional variables. All the three indices, representing three institutional pillars turned significant: 'Rule of law' (negative coefficient), 'Regulatory efficiency' (positive coefficient) and 'normative institutional environment' (negative coefficient). This implies that one of the main motivations for foreign investors to make investment in emerging economies is to take advantage of their weak laws, norms and values. But they also seek a basic enabling environment with minimum burdens as far as the efficiency of regulations is concerned.

AB  - Persistency of organic chemicals is a key property in their environmental risk assessment. Information on persistency is often derived from the results of biodegradability screening tests such as the ready biodegradability tests (RBTs). RBTs are, however, not designed for this purpose and suffer from several problems that lead to a high variability of the results and, hence, to difficulties in their interpretation. The origin and exposure history of the inocula used for biodegradability testing can lead to highly variable outcomes. Microbial adaptation to chemicals and its impact on biodegradation needs further investigation in order to have a better understanding of their effects on persistency assessments of chemicals. It is well described that microbial adaptation stimulates biodegradation of organic chemicals. Several mechanisms responsible for these phenomena have been described, amongst which are i) shifts in community composition or abundances, ii) mutations within populations, iii) horizontal gene transfer or iv) recombination events. These adaptation processes may well be mimicked under laboratory conditions, but the outcome remains difficult to predict as we lack a fundamental understanding of the adaptive responses. This review aims to bring together our current knowledge regarding microbial adaptation and its implication for the testing of biodegradation of chemicals.

AB  - Freshwater species are adapted to and depend on various discharge conditions, such as 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). Knowing how these indicators will be altered under climate change is essential for predicting species response and to develop mitigation concepts. The simulation of IHA under climate change is subject to considerable uncertainties which should be considered to obtain credible and robust predictions. Therefore, we investigated the major uncertainties inherent in climate change data and processing: general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) choice, representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario, bias correction (BC) method, all within three mesoscale catchments in the European ecoregions: Central Plains, Central Highlands, and Alpine. Highest uncertainties were caused by the GCM and RCM choice, followed by the type of BC and the RCP. For the prediction, we reduced these uncertainties tailored to the ideal depiction of the IHA in each ecoregion. Together with a significance test, this enabled a robust depiction of the change in IHA for two future time periods. We found diverging changes within the ecoregions, caused by the complex interaction between precipitation, temperature and the governing catchment hydrological processes. The results provide an important basis for further impact research, especially for ecological freshwater studies.

AB  - Connecting the life history stages of the annual cycle via carry-over effects crucially informs estimates of mortality and reproduction. This study explores variables linking the breeding and wintering seasons in a pursuit-diving seabird, the thick-billed murre Uria lomvia. We deployed global location sensing loggers on chick-rearing murres breeding in the southeastern Bering Sea to examine subsequent overwinter locations and foraging behavior. In the tracked individuals, we measured individual telomere length and longitudinal telomere length changes in blood and used feathers molted during fall and early spring to assess trophic niche (via stable isotopes) and stress levels (as reflected in feather corticosterone levels). Longitudinal changes in telomere length were better predicted by winter diving parameters than by geographic distribution and movement variables, such that birds that foraged more intensely (more time diving, more dive bouts) also experienced higher telomere loss. This indicates that in a pursuit-diving species with high flight costs, patterns of water-column use through diving may be more important than horizontal spatial movement for predicting physiological changes underlying carry-over effects. We conclude that telomere dynamics might be used as an indicator connecting behavior and physiological stress from season to season.

AB  - Water sources in public places like parks and squares are often used by people as an alternative for available water, which might be a public health concern when there is no adequate quality for consumption. The aim of this study was to evaluate the water quality from the fountains located in three public parks in Curitiba, Parana, Brasil. The monitoring was conducted monthly by microbiological analysis of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (EC) and heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and the pH was taken, with triplicate samples during a year at three sites: Atuba Park (A), Gutierrez Park (B) and Sao Lourenco Park (C). The results showed TC in site A; at B it was observed the presence, at high levels, of TC (log 2.4350 +/- 0.6730 NMP center dot 100 mL(-1)), EC (log 1.0890 +/- 0.6327 NMP center dot 100 mL(-1)) and HB (log 1.9170 +/- 0.6920 UFC center dot mL-1), significant differences among sampling periods were not observed (p>0.05). It was observed that in the rainy season the condition of water portability decreased in all evaluated sites with a significant increase in TC, followed by increasing of HB, suggesting infiltration in the channeled sources. The presence of E. coli in site B suggests wastewater pollution, which can endanger the health people consuming the available water in the taps.

AB  - This study proposes a method for stator fault detection of inverter-fed induction machine in closed-loop control. The sideband response of inverter switching harmonics in common-mode voltage (CMV) is employed to detect the stator inter-turn fault, thus no additional injected signal is necessary. However, the PWM nature harmonics introduce undesired CMV signals, depending on the inherent imbalance or resistance asymmetry. For this reason, the CMV amplitude is not suitable to indicate the fault directly. In this study, the behaviour of switching harmonic is analysed first, and then a simple but efficient stator fault model is demonstrated. To suppress the adverse interference from inverter, an inter-turn fault indicator is proposed by utilising both of the switching sidebands. This method can obtain fault location and severity with low sensitivity to steady operating condition and stator imbalance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Technological advancements in remote sensing and telemetry provide opportunities for assessing the effects of expanding extractive industries on animal populations. Here, we illustrate the applicability of resource selection functions (RSFs) for modelling wildlife habitat selection on industrially-disturbed landscapes. We used grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) from a threatened population in Canada and surface mining as a case study. RSF predictions based on GPS radiocollared bears (n(during) (mining) = 7; n(post mining) = 9) showed that males and solitary females selected areas primarily outside mineral surface leases (MSLs) during active mining, and conversely inside MSLs after mine closure. However, females with cubs selected areas within compared to outside MSLs irrespective of mining activity. Individual variability was pronounced, although some environmental and human-related variables were consistent across reproductive classes. For males and solitary females, regional-scale RSFs yielded comparable results to site-specific models, whereas for females with cubs, modelling the two scales produced divergent results. While mine reclamation may afford opportunities for bear persistence, managing public access will likely decrease the risk of human-caused bear mortality. RSFs are powerful tools that merit widespread use in quantitative and visual investigations of wildlife habitat selection on industrially-modified landscapes, using Geographic Information System layers that precisely characterize site-specific conditions.

AB  - To what extent can simple mental exercises cause shifts in empathic habits? Can we use mobile technology to make people more empathic? It may depend on how empathy is measured. Scholars have identified a number of different facets and correlates of empathy. This study is among the first to take a comprehensive, multidimensional approach to empathy to determine how empathy training could affect these different facets and correlates. In doing so, we can learn more about empathy and its multifaceted nature. Participants (N = 90) were randomly assigned to receive either an empathy-building text message program (Text to Connect) or one of two control conditions (active versus passive). Respondents completed measures of dispositional empathy (i.e. self-perceptions of being an empathic person), affective empathy (i.e. motivations to help, immediate feelings of empathic concern), and prosocial behavior (i.e. self-reports and observer-reports) at baseline, and then again after the 14 day intervention period. We found that empathy-building messages increased affective indicators of empathy and prosocial behaviors, but actually decreased self-perceptions of empathy, relative to control messages. Although the brief text messaging intervention did not consistently impact empathy-related personality traits, it holds promise for the use of mobile technology for changing empathic motivations and behaviors.

AB  - Many scientists agree that the genes involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases could serve as biomarkers - biological indicators of the health status. Genetic markers may inform about general predispositions of a person to develop certain diseases, while other biochemical factors, such as concentrations of substances in body fluids, reflect the actual condition of the organism. Researchers involved in studies on schizophrenia are interested in the gene and protein of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) due to the role of this neurotrophin in the process of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and its influence on the functioning of dopaminergic neurons.
   Among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, the BDNF gene polymorphisms and methylation in the promoter sequences were studied. The neurotrophin was also assayed in the blood of patients, also taking into account the effect of pharmacotherapy on the BDNF concentration, and post-mortem in the brains of the patients. The results of current studies are contradictory. The only systematically confirmed observation is the lowered concentration of BDNF in the serum of patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. It seems that so far our knowledge about the BDNF gene expression and the functions of the protein is not sufficient to include BDNF analysis in the clinical assessment of patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - The literature concerning methane (CH4) emissions from temperate and boreal lakes is extensive, but emissions from tropical and subtropical lakes have been less documented. In particular, methane emissions from Mexican lakes, which are often polluted by anthropogenic carbon and nutrient inputs, have not been reported previously. In this work, methane emissions from six Mexican lakes were measured, covering a broad range of organic inputs, trophic states, and climatic conditions. Methane emissions ranged from 5 to 5,000 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). Water samples from several depths in each lake were analyzed for correlation between water quality indicators and methane emissions. Trophic state and water quality indexes were most strongly correlated with methane fluxes. The global methane flux from Mexican freshwater lakes was estimated to be approximately 1.3 Tg CH4 year(-1), which is about 20% of methane and 4.4% of total national greenhouse gas emissions. Data for untreated wastewater releases to the environment gave an emission factor of 0.19 kg CH4 kg(-1) of Biochemical Oxygen Demand, which is superior to that previously estimated by the IPCC for lake discharges. Thus, the large volume of untreated wastewater in Mexico implies higher methane emission than previously estimated.

AB  - Sophisticated space weather monitoring aims at nowcasting and predicting solar-terrestrial interactions because their effects on the ionosphere and upper atmosphere may seriously impact advanced technology. Operating alert infrastructures rely heavily on ground-based measurements and satellite observations of the solar and interplanetary conditions. New opportunities lie in the implementation of in-situ observations of the ionosphere and upper atmosphere onboard low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites. The multi-satellite mission Swarm is equipped with several instruments which will observe electromagnetic and atmospheric parameters of the near Earth space environment. Taking advantage of the multi-disciplinary measurements and the mission constellation different Swarm products have been defined or demonstrate great potential for further development of novel space weather products. Examples are satellite based magnetic indices monitoring effects of the magnetospheric ring current or the polar electrojet, polar maps of ionospheric conductance and plasma convection, indicators of energy deposition like Poynting flux, or the prediction of post sunset equatorial plasma irregularities. Providing these products in timely manner will add significant value in monitoring present space weather and helping to predict the evolution of several magnetic and ionospheric events. Swarm will be a demonstrator mission for the valuable application of LEO satellite observations for space weather monitoring tools.

AB  - A combined geophysical investigation consisting of vertical electrical sounding (VES) and multielectrode system was carried out to map the subsurface resistivity in all major lakes which are highly polluted by the discharge of sewage and other chemical effluents in greater Hyderabad, India. The structural features identified in the study area play a major role in groundwater flow and storage. The interpretation of geophysical data and lithologs indicates that a silt/clay zone (predominantly silt) has a thickness of 5-10 m all along the drainage from Patelcheruvu to the Musi River. The silt/clay zone inferred close to the lakes is a mixture of clay, silt and sand with more silt content as indicated from the lithologs during drilling. The low resistivity values obtained can be attributed to the pollutant accumulated in the silt which can reduce the resistivity values. Further, the TDS of the water samples in these wells are more than 1,000 mg/l which further confirms the above scenario. The pollution spread is less in the upstream areas whereas it is more in the downstream which can be attributed to the shallow water table conditions and also due to the interaction of surface water and groundwater.

AB  - Quality of life is often measured using questions about happiness. This method presumes that respondents are able to judge their life. Research suggest that this is typically the case, but this is not to say that everybody can. In that context one may doubt whether people with a mental disorder can judge their life adequately. Happiness can be rejected as a indicator for quality of life for people with mental disorders, because of affective and cognitive distortions. We therefore checked the validity of happiness and satisfaction measures in the context of mental disorders. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined at baseline and at 12 and 36 months follow-up in a representative sample (N = 7,076) of the Dutch population, using a full Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Respondents indicated how often they had felt happy during the past month and how satisfied they were with their lives in general. The measurements have a satisfactory concurrent, ecological and predictive validity for people with mental disorders. Though the level of happiness is lower among the people with mental disorders, conditions for happiness and contentment appear to be similar.

AB  - Indicators are helpful tools for land use management; especially in the context of sustainable urban development, they are indispensable information bases for decision making, communication, and awareness rising. For Santiago de Chile, like many other large and dynamic cities, a high complexity of geographical conditions, social and land use pattern, diverging interests, and a high velocity of development are characteristic. In this situation, the Risk Habitat Megacity (RHM) initiative seeks to support local and regional authorities in elaborating indicators applicable in land use and flood risk management.
   In this article, the indicator approach of the Land Use Management group within the RHM initiative is presented. Based on the analysis of characteristics of and demands on sustainability indicators, existing indicator sets for Santiago de Chile are analysed. Thereafter, the indicator set for sustainable land use management in Santiago de Chile is presented. It was elaborated in a combined bottom-up and top-down approach in discussion with Chilean scientists and stakeholders in order to guarantee its relevancy to practice. The analysis of the already existing indicators in Santiago de Chile shows that the newly developed toolset forms a valuable and complementary addition, mainly for two reasons: the interdisciplinary nature of the set and its reproducibility.

AB  - The effects of growth temperature in the range of 20-45C on the heat resistance of Listeria innocua (CECT 910) at different heating temperatures (56, 59, 62 and 65C) were investigated. D values were lower for cells grown at 20C and significantly increased with increasing growth temperature up to 45C, showing D values about five times higher. The inactivation rate of L. innocua at the heating temperatures tested decreased exponentially with growth temperature. The z values were not significantly modified by growth temperature, obtaining a mean value of 5.65 +/- 0.19C. The decimal reduction times at different heating temperatures for L. innocua cells grown at different temperatures were succesfully described using a mathematical equation.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   The prediction of the effectiveness of thermal processing against foodborne pathogen microorganisms is essential to permit the establishment of safe processing conditions and is critical for its effective application in food preservation. In this work, a mathematical equation has been developed which permits the description of the effect of growth temperature and treatment temperature on the thermal inactivation of Listeria innocua, a microorganism considered to be a biological indicator to assess the lethality of heat treatments with regard to Listeria monocytogenes, which represents a great concern for the food industry, health regulatory officials and consumers.

AB  - The long term recharge in Gobi Desert from Hexi Corridor to Inner Mongolia Plateau was estimated to be 1 mm year(-1) by using the chloride mass balance method from one unsaturated zone profile, which shows that no effective modern recharge is taking place. A good rainfall database from Zhangye provides definition of the stable isotopic composition of modern rainfall. The signature of groundwater from the late Pleistocene differs markedly from that of the Holocene, shown clearly by the compositions of -10.5 parts per thousand delta O-18 as compared with values of -7 parts per thousand at the present day. It is apparent that the groundwaters in the Minqin Basin, Ejina Basin and feeding the lake system of the Badain Jaran are part of a regional flow network related to a wetter past climate as source of recharge. The recharge source in the past and to a limited extent in the more arid conditions of the present day included the foothills of the mountains of the Tibetan Plateau. The tritium age determinations accurate to the year are impossible and of no meaning to groundwater studies. A tritium value in the groundwater means multiple recharge ages in this region.

AB  - Long-term solutions for the disposal of toxic wastes usually involve isolation of the wastes in a deep subsurface geologic environment. In the case of spent nuclear fuel, if radionuclide leakage occurs from the engineered barrier, the geological medium represents the ultimate barrier that is relied upon to ensure safety. Consequently, an evaluation of radionuclide travel times from a repository to the biosphere is critically important in a performance assessment analysis. In this study, we develop a travel time framework based on the concept of groundwater lifetime expectancy as a safety indicator. Lifetime expectancy characterizes the time that radionuclides will spend in the subsurface after their release from the repository and prior to discharging into the biosphere. The probability density function of lifetime expectancy is computed throughout the host rock by solving the backward-in-time solute transport adjoint equation subject to a properly posed set of boundary conditions. It can then be used to define optimal repository locations. The risk associated with selected sites can be evaluated by simulating an appropriate contaminant release history. The utility of the method is illustrated by means of analytical and numerical examples, which focus on the effect of fracture networks on the uncertainty of evaluated lifetime expectancy.

AB  - Species richness, cover and community structure of reef-building corals were assessed at 599 sites on 135 reefs along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) between 1994 and 2001, with focus on the nearshore area. Communities were described hierarchically, with smaller regional communities forming part of higher level communities at increasing spatial scales. Site richness increased from the coast to the mid-continental shelf, declining on the outer shelf. Richness also increased with depth to 5 in, stabilizing thereafter. An anomaly was present in a 400 km section adjacent to the northern, 'wet tropics' coast, where site richness was 67 and 41 % lower than the adjacent far northern and central GBR, respectively; this was probably due to the disturbance regime, with an apparent anthropogenic component. Site richness also declined in the Southern GBR, probably due to naturally marginal conditions. All indicator species had highest values in five small Far Northern and Central GBR communities. In the eight depauperate communities no indicator species had high values, indicating that these communities represent degraded, yet potentially transitional forms of the more diverse communities of the Far Northern and Central GBR. The study shows that on the GBR, disturbance results in the local removal of corals rather than a shift to suites of other coral species.

AB  - The population of the caprellid Metaprotella sandalensis Mayer (Crustacea: Amphipoda) associated with the seaweed Turbinaria ornata (Turner) J. Agardh was studied on a spatial scale in relation to the influence of physico-chemical factors on the coral reef system at Mauritius Island. Some areas of the coast of Mauritius are currently subject to disturbance due to industrialisation and rapidly growing tourist development programmes, meanwhile other sites of the island are still unaltered. T ornata was sampled at 12 stations, distributed around the whole island to represent the heterogeneous conditions. The density of Metaprotella sandalensis living on T ornata was measured. The linear regression and the multivariate analysis showed a strong correlation between the densities of the caprellid and the physico-chemical parameters. The highest densities of M. sandalensis were found in the most stressed sites characterised by the highest values of nitrate, phosphate, chemical oxygen demand and silting. According to these results and taking into account that M. sandalensis and T ornata are widely distributed in most of the tropical ecosystems, we preliminarily propose usage of the density of this caprellid as a new monitoring tool on coral reefs or, at least, as a first diagnosis for the detection of nutrient enrichment on these ecosystems.

AB  - The diversity of criteria and indicators (C&I) sets is often a cause for uncertainty and confusion, and probably one of the reasons for the still unsatisfactory acceptance of C&I as a support for implementation of sustainable forest management. In order to address this erosion of confidence in C&I this paper evaluates the diversity of five C&I sets (CIFOR, ACM, FSC, ITTO and Tarapoto) relevant for the Brazilian Amazon by analysing frequencies of C&I in relation to parameters about content and quality. The study demonstrated that the C&I sets, although addressing the social, technical, ecological and economic dimensions of sustainability, exhibit different thematic foci. A general lack of validity was attested as well as missing specificity and practicability of the indicators. In order to increase objectivity and transparency, the C&I have to reflect more clearly and unambiguously what is actually assessed. It is recommended to include a discussion about verifiers and assessment methods in the development of C&I sets. To avoid misunderstandings and to introduce the possibility for less complex and more practicable C&I sets, the authors recommend constriction of the objective of the assessment to more clearly serve the potential clients and frame-conditions for its application.

AB  - A study of the distributions of free and S-bound biomarkers and their delta(13)C values in the extract of a bulk sample of the Permian Kupferschiefer from the Lower Rhine Basin has been carried out to provide a more detailed characterization of the biological inputs. The distributions and isotopic compositions of selected components released from nickel boride desulphurization have been compared with those of components in the free fraction. The free biomarkers occur in greater abundance than their S-bound counterparts. The distribution and carbon isotopic composition of both free and bound components in the extract indicate a major cyanobacterial and algal input. Likewise, the free and bound aromatic hydrocarbons contain components which reveal an origin from the carotenoids of Chlorobiaceae (green sulphur bacteria), providing molecular evidence for the occurrence of photic zone anoxia in the water column. Most of the components in the complex mixture of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-aromatics in the free aromatic hydrocarbon fraction result from cyclization and aromatization reactions.

AB  - In bacteria, exposure to changes in environmental conditions can alter membrane fluidity, thereby affecting its essential functions in cell physiology. To adapt to these changes, bacteria maintain appropriate fluidity by varying the composition of the fatty acids of membrane phospholipids, a phenomenon known as homeophasic adaptation. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, this response is achieved mainly by two mechanisms of fatty acid desaturation: the FabA-FabB and DesA-DesB systems. This study analyzed the effect of ultraviolet-A (UVA) radiation-the major fraction of solar UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface-on the homeophasic process. The prototypical strain PAO1 was grown under sublethal UVA doses or in the dark, and the profiles of membrane fatty acids were compared at early logarithmic, logarithmic and stationary growth phases. In the logarithmic growth phase, it was observed that growth under sublethal UVA doses induced the expression of the desaturase-encoding genes desA and desB and increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids; in addition, membrane fluidity could also increase, as suggested by the indices used as indicators of this parameter. The opposite effect was observed in the stationary growth phase. These results demonstrate the relevant role of UVA on the homeophasic response at transcriptional level.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-criteria optimization based on parametric sensitivity analysis for the sizing of a hybrid renewable production system (photovoltaic-wind) coupled to a water pumping and reverse osmosis water desalination unit. A dynamic simulator of the proposed system which includes photovoltaic-wind (PV/wind) renewable generators, three motor-pumps (well pumping, water storage and desalination), reverse osmosis desalination unit, three water tanks, annual consumption data of freshwater with a sampling step of 10 min, annual data of weather conditions (Southern Tunisia), energy management and life cycle analysis indicators is developed. An energy management strategy is integrated into a dynamic simulator in order to share the power flow during the system operation. A parametric sensitivities-optimization method based on a genetic algorithm allows us to find the best configuration between the PV array areas, the wind turbine swept area and the capacity of the storage tanks with a reduced process time. The best configuration is predicted on the basis of the minimum primary energy requirement (environmental indicator) with an Loss of Power Supply Probability equal to 0% (reliability indicator). As a result, optimization based on sensitivity analysis is a good way to make the system more effective and run more smoothly.

AB  - In the conditions of climate change and the scarcity of natural resources, the future of energy is increasingly associated with the development of the so-called green energy. Its development is reflected in the European Commission strategic vision to transition to a climate-neutral economy. This is a challenge that the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, members of the EU, are also trying to meet. In recent years, these countries have seen an increase in the share of renewable energy and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GGE). On the other hand, basing the energy sector on unstable energy sources (photovoltaics and wind technologies) may imply new challenges on the way to sustainable development. These are old problems in a new version (ecology, diversification of supplies) and new ones related to the features of renewable energy sources (RES; instability, dispersion). The aim of the article was to classify, on the basis of taxonomic methods, the CEE countries from the point of view of green energy transformation (original indicator) and to predict new threats to Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria, the countries representing different groups according to the applied classification. The issues presented are part of a holistic view of RES and can be useful in energy policy.

AB  - The objectives of this study are to measure and analyse the resilience of the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) economies between 2006 and 2015. Our methodology is that of the B2A algorithm and the graph theory. This study highlights two main results: firstly, results from 22 SSA countries show that very few show characteristics of a stable resilience, while most of these countries are still in a condition of uncontrolled vulnerability (or very fragile). Secondly, the South African economies show the highest resilience, though unstable, Central Africa and East Africa economies show a situation of controlled vulnerability, while the West African economies are the most fragile, though heterogeneous. Looking at country specificities, Cameroon, South Africa and Botswana are the only three countries in the sub-region to have maintained a stable situation of resilience. The policy implications of this study engage the SSA countries on the need to further enhance their macroeconomic policies especially policies that improve the contingent dimensions of resilience. These include improvement in political governance, fiscal sustainability and external balances. Policies which are growth driven are encouraged; this will lead to job creation, human development and, as a result, reduction in the social vulnerability. Moreover, natural resource exports revenues should be invested into other economic sectors to support long-term diversification and consequently resilience.

AB  - Blockage of sand-control media is one of the main obstacles that affect gas production efficiency from gas hydrate-bearing sediments. Hydrate reformation is a potential plugging inducer of sand-control media. In this study, we conduct a series of experiments using steel-wired screen mesh to examine the hydrate-induced clogging of sand-control screen. The screen mesh sample was installed into a closed-circuit circulating system under gas-water two-phase flow condition to simulate bottomhole multiphase production processes. The results indicate that hydrate formation within the screen would causes permeability loss of the screen up to 98%. The pseudo-permeability of the screen sample shows dual-gradient decreasing characteristics during hydrate clogging. Therefore, we speculate that hydrate accumulating and hydrate particle bridging are the two main mechanisms causing screen plugging. The hydrate accumulating sub-process is mainly controlled by the degree of subcooling, while the hydrate particle-bridging sub-process is affected by fluid flow rate. Furthermore, the "J-shape" coiling of pressure-temperature relationship can be used as an indicator in diagnosing possible bottomhole screen plug during hydrate exploitation. Artificial interference of downhole temperature is strongly recommended to mitigate screen plugging induced by hydrate reformation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: OsWRKY71, a WRKY protein from rice, is reported to function during biotic stresses. It is requisite to further enquire the efficiency and mechanism of OsWRKY71 under various environmental stresses. Stress indicators such as salt, cold, heat, and drought were studied by overexpressing the OsWRKY71 in E. coli.
   Materials and methods: DNA binding domain containing region of OsWRKY71 was cloned and expressed in E. coli followed by exposure to stress conditions. OsWRKY71 was also assessed for its role in abiotic stresses in rice by qPCR.
   Results: Recombinant E. coli expressing OsWRKY71 was more tolerant to stresses such as heat, salt and drought in spot assay. The tolerance was further confirmed by monitoring the bacterial growth in liquid culture assay demonstrating that it encourages the E. coli growth under salt, drought, and heat stresses. This tolerance may be the consequence of OsWRKY71 interaction with the promoter of stress related genes or with other proteins in bacteria. The RT-qPCR analysis revealed the up-regulation of OsWRKY71 gene in rice upon interaction to cold, salt, drought and wounding with maximum up-regulation against salinity.
   Conclusion: Thus, the defensive role of OsWRKY71 may accord to the development and survival of plants during different environmental stresses.

AB  - An air-independent propulsion system containing fuel cells is applied to improve the operational performance of underwater vehicles in an underwater environment. Fuel-reforming efficiently stores and supplies hydrogen required to operate fuel cells. In this study, the applicability of a fuel-reforming system using various fuels for underwater vehicles was analyzed by calculating the fuel and water consumptions, the amount of CO2 generated as a byproduct, and the amount of water required to dissolve the CO2 using aspen HYSYS (Aspen Technology, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). In addition, the performance of the fuel-reforming system for methanol, which occupies the smallest volume in the system, was researched by analyzing performance indicators such as methanol conversion rate, hydrogen, yield and selectivity, and reforming efficiency under conditions at which pressure, temperature, steam-to-carbon ratio (SCR), and hydrogen separation efficiency vary. The highest reforming efficiency was 77.7-77.8% at 260 degrees C and 270 degrees C. At SCR 1.5, the reforming efficiency was the highest, which is 77.8%, and the CO2 generation amount was the lowest at 1.46 kmol/h. At high separation efficiency, the reforming efficiency increased due to the reduction of reactants, and a rate at which energy is consumed for endothermic reactions also decreased, resulting in a lower CO2 generation amount.

AB  - Today, the effects of the indoor environment on occupants' health and comfort represent a very important topic and requires a holistic approach in which the four main environmental factors (thermal comfort, air quality, acoustics, and lighting) should be simultaneously assessed. The present paper shows the results of a literature survey that aimed to collect the indicators for the evaluation of occupants' health and comfort in indoor environmental quality evaluations. A broad number of papers that propose the indicators of a specific environmental factor is available in the scientific literature, but a review that collects the indicators of all four factors is lacking. In this review paper, the difference between indicators for the evaluation of risk for human health and for comfort evaluation is clarified. For each environmental factor, the risk for human health indicators are proposed with the relative threshold values, and the human comfort indicators are grouped into categories according to the number of parameters included, or the specific field of application for which they are proposed. Furthermore, the differences between human health and comfort indicators are highlighted.

AB  - Single-mode optical fiber is one of the most extended wired transmission media providing broadband high-speed communications all over the world whose performance highly depends on chromatic dispersion and modulation's effects. The motivation of this study is to offer a graphical analyzer of the propagation of Gaussian and super-Gaussian light pulses directly modulated in a single-mode optical fiber subject to chromatic dispersion of first and second-order. The abstract nature of this electromagnetic phenomenon makes any tool that helps learners of optical fiber its understanding a useful resource. Through interactive learning, it is intended to facilitate the comprehension of the behavior of the fiber and feature its capacity in terms of bandwidth and length depending on different parameters and conditions. Also, the study and recreation of directly modulated pulses propagating in the dispersive fiber cannot only be used to teach the students how to avoid its negative impact but to use it as a mechanism to improve the properties of the whole optical communications system. The proposed analyzer consists of a MATLAB graphical user interface integrating the visualization of pulses in time, frequency and carrier's behavior together with additional graphs to interpret and correct chirp and numerical and textual indicators, menus and dialogs to understand the final outcome.

AB  - Instream barriers, such as dams, culverts, and diversions, alter hydrologic processes and aquatic habitat. Removing uneconomical and aging instream barriers is increasingly used for river restoration. Historically, selection of barrier removal projects used score-and-rank techniques, ignoring cumulative change and the spatial structure of stream networks. Likewise, most water supply models prioritize either human water uses or aquatic habitat, failing to incorporate both human and environmental water use benefits. Here, a dual-objective optimization model identifies barriers to remove that maximize connected aquatic habitat and minimize water scarcity. Aquatic habitat is measured using monthly average streamflow, temperature, channel gradient, and geomorphic condition as indicators of aquatic habitat suitability. Water scarcity costs are minimized using economic penalty functions while a budget constraint specifies the money available to remove barriers. We demonstrate the approach using a case study in Utah's Weber Basin to prioritize removal of instream barriers for Bonneville cutthroat trout, while maintaining human water uses. Removing 54 instream barriers reconnects about 160 km of quality-weighted habitat and costs approximately US$10 M. After this point, the cost-effectiveness of removing barriers to connect river habitat decreases. The modeling approach expands barrier removal optimization methods by explicitly including both economic and environmental water uses.

AB  - Polar ice sheets conserve atmospheric mineral dust (aerosols) at the time of snowfall, and this material can be used to reconstruct historical climate and environmental conditions. Snowpit samples were obtained from the East Greenland Ice Core Project (EGRIP) site in July 2017. Mineral dust concentrations as well as stable water isotope (O-18, D, and deuterium excess) and major ion (F-, Cl-, NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, methanesulfonic acid (MSA), Na+, NH4+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) concentrations were analyzed in this study. The seasonal O-18 and D cycles indicate that the snowpit samples covered the period from winter 2012 to summer 2017. The concentrations of mineral dust and Ca2+ showed seasonal deposition events with maxima in the spring layers. The concentrations of MSA exhibited maxima in the summer layers, making them useful indicators for the summer season. Moreover, an anomalous non-sea salt SO42- (nss SO42-) event was recorded at a depth of 130-85cm that corresponded to the Holuhraun eruption (31 August 2014). In addition, a significant short-term cooling effect was observed. A back-trajectory analysis suggests that a major ash event from Iceland contributed to the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). These results provide insight for future studies of the EGRIP ice core.

AB  - Cardiac valves are highly complex structures optimizing their function during the cardiac cycle. They open and close directed by blood flow under different pressure conditions in the dynamic environment in the heart. It is acknowledged that the aging process affects the structure and functions of the heart valves. With regard to morphometry, age-related changes of the heart valve can be found in valve circumference, thickness of the leaflet, luminal area at the sinotubular junction, valve diameter, orifice area, and leaflet size in circumferential and radial direction. In addition, there are differences between male and female hearts in some features. Moreover, there are studies the qualitative and quantitative assessment of histological compositions, echocardiography study to investigate the annular circumference and diameter in the human heart valves related with age. Studies into the detailed anatomy of the changes in heart valves with age are important and the correlation between valve morphology and age may be used as an age indicator. This study reviews the basic anatomical structure of the heart valves, age-related changes of valve morphometry, heart valve diseases, and general treatment of valvular diseases in humans. Detailed knowledge of the anatomical features of the morphology of the human heart valve is useful for any treatments of valve pathology.

AB  - Several microbiological indicators of soil quality present high sensitivity, but little is known about the influence of topographic factors on them. This work aimed to evaluate variability of biological indicators of soil quality across a hillslope under native forest and the influence of topographic factors on them. Four positions on a hillslope were evaluated. Activity of the enzymes P-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, urease and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis were determined, as well as basal and substrate-induced respiration, and density of microorganisms: total bacteria, total fungi, actinobacteria, phosphate solubilizers, ammonifiers, native rhizobia, free-living N-2-fixing bacteria, spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and percentage of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Activity and density of microorganisms were correlated with topographic factors. The relation of these factors to the variations of the evaluated indicators was detennined using the random forest algorithm. Microbiological indicators varied according to the hillslope positions. The indicators urease, basal respiration, spore density, mycorrhizal colonization, total bacteria and fungi, phosphate solubilizers, and free-living N-2-fixing bacteria detected in JNFB and FAM culture medium did not vary with terrain attributes and were therefore more indicated in cases of topographic variations. This and future studies can help to select the best microbiological indicators for different conditions.

AB  - There are numerous wetland rehabilitation projects worldwide, but their efficiency is seldom assessed comprehensively. Oxbow lakes are wetlands of particular sensitivity. Within a large-scale floodplain rehabilitation project in Hungary, the Old Drava Programme, water replenishment was first carried out for the C6n-Szaporca oxbow lakes, a key area in the project. To assess its sustainability, the entire hydrological system has been monitored. From the data of hydrological monitoring (infiltration, soil moisture, groundwater/lakewater interaction) it is claimed that water replenishment involves significant losses through seepage (4.1 and 1.46 mm d(-1)) and evaporation (3.01 and 1.44 mm d(-1)) in the studied pre -intervention and replenishment periods, resp. Infiltration alone is insufficient to replenish groundwater and raise oxbow lake levels. In the critical summer half -year evaporation is intensive in the neighbouring agricultural fields. Groundwater table dynamics are controlled by hyporheic and groundwater flow. Major impact on the water balance of the oxbow lakes is exerted by the regime of the Drava River. A deepened lakebed is recommended to ensure more effective water retention in the oxbow lake. From the local study conclusions are drawn for the feasibility of rehabilitation at floodplain scale and in areas with similar hydromorphological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article examines the impact of fiscal, legal, economic, demographic, natural-geographic factors on the evolution of the merchant class of the Yenisei province in the 1860-ies - the beginning of the twentieth century. Having studied statistics, information, class-of a personal nature, archival documents, the authors came to the conclusion that the effect of each factor was vector. Fiscal and legal policy of the state, following the socio-economic processes of the Russian Empire structured the merchant, and determined the ratio of class of business and functions. Economic conditions tied to the resource and commodity and logistics indicators have been defined the dynamics of entrepreneurial activity of merchant capital. The demographic factor, which is expressed in quantitative and qualitative indicators of the population as a whole, determined the background of the modernization process in the country: urbanization, the degree of social mobility, growth of entrepreneurial activity. The interaction of these factors gave rise to their complex layering on top of each other that defines the individual pattern of regional character. But, despite the presence of regional particularities, the General course of the evolution of the merchant class of the Yenisei province, and merchants of the Russian Empire, followed the path of the liberation of the enterprise from class barriers.

AB  - Ammonia, methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions were measured during a complete production cycle in an enriched cage laying hen facility under Oceanic climate conditions. Continuous monitoring of gas concentration, ventilation rate and environmental parameters were conducted from April 2012 to September 2013. The seasonal and diurnal pattern of gas emissions was analysed.
   Seasonality effect was found for NH3 emission, showing an average emission of 144.9 mg d(-1) hen(-1) and 90.3 mg d(-1) hen(-1) in summer and winter, respectively. On the contrary, diurnal pattern of NH3 emission did not differ between these seasons. For CO2, mean emission values did not show seasonality, although the diurnal pattern differed between winter and summer. Results obtained for CH4 and N2O emissions did not provide sufficient evidence to determine either seasonality or diurnal effect on these gases.
   An NH3 emission factor of 7% of total N in manure was defined for this system. These losses increased at higher ventilation rates and lower belt cleaning frequencies. Thus, NH3 mitigation strategies at housing level should consider both parameters. Further studies would be necessary to determine how these factors regulate NH3 emission at laying hen houses.

AB  - A new model based on the quantum chemical approach is proposed to describe structural and thermodynamic parameters of clusterization for substituted alkalies at the air/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces. The new model by the authors, unlike the previous one, proposes an explicit account Of the liquid phase (phases) influence on, the parameters of monomers, clusters and monolayers of substituted alkanes at the regarded interface. The calculations were carried :but in the frameworks of the quantum chemical semiempirical PM3 method (Mopac 2012), using the COSMO procedure. The new model was tested in the calculations of the clusterization parameters of fatty alcohols under the standard conditions at the air/water interface. The enthalpy, Gibbs energy and absolute entropy of formation for alcohol monomers alongside with clusterization parameters for the cluster series including the monolayer at air/water interface were calculated. In Our calculations the sinkage of monomers, molecules in clusters and monolayers was varied from 1 up to 5 methylene groups. Thermodynamic parameters calculated using the proposed model for the alcohol monolayers are in a good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. However, the proposed model cannot define the most energetically preferable immersion of the monolayer molecules in the water phase.

AB  - In this case study, the impact of a temporary (4 days) interruption of a sewage treatment works on the microbial quality of a drinking water source in SE Norway to which the sewage was discharged was investigated. Samples of wastewater and river water were taken before and during the interruption of the sewage treatment and analysed for various microbial indicators and pathogens: faecal indicator bacteria (E. coli and total coliforms); F-specific RNA bacteriophages; pathogenic viruses (norovirus GI and GII, adenovirus); protozoan parasites (Giardia and Cryptosporidium). Water at the inlet to the drinking water treatment plant, 20 km downstream from the sewage discharge, was not found to be significantly affected with respect to bacteria and parasites, with higher concentrations measured prior to the sewage treatment interruption, probably associated with a period of heavy rainfall. For viruses, however, the heavy rainfall appeared to be of lesser relevance to the contamination levels. These data demonstrate the importance of water providers having a clear overview not only of sewage discharge in water catchment areas but also of other potential sources of contamination with different pathogens and indicators, and the effects of weather conditions on contamination events.

AB  - The late Pleistocene was a time of environmental change, culminating in an extinction event. Few fossil localities record a temporal series of carnivore fossil populations from this interesting interval as well as Rancho La Brea (RLB). We analysed mandibles of Smilodon fatalis from RLB using 2-D geometric morphometrics to examine whether, and how, mandibular shape changes through time. Smilodon fatalis shows mandibular evolution with oscillations between a small, ancestral-type morph in pits 77 (approximate to 37Kybp) and 2051 (approximate to 26Kybp), a larger, more derived morph in pits 91 (approximate to 28Kybp) and 61-67 (approximate to 13.6Kybp), and an intermediate morph from pit 13 (approximate to 17.7Kybp). These oscillations end in pit 61-67, with greatest body size, and are estimated to have its widest gape and lowest bite force. Additionally, variation is lowest in pit 61-67, which was deposited concurrent with the Bolling-Allerod warming event, which may have important implications for the timing or conditions during the extinction event. Contra to a temporal Bergmann's rule, such rapid warming events appear to be correlated with larger, derived, morphologies whereas static, cooler, climates correlate with gracile, ancestral morphologies.

AB  - To conduct site-specific exposure assessments for contaminants containing reducible functional groups, it is imperative to know the identity and reactivity of chemical reductants in natural sediments and to associate their reactivity with easily measurable sediment properties. For this purpose the reactivity, as defined by pseudofirst order reduction rate constants for p-cyanonitrobenzene (pCNB), was measured in twenty-one natural sediments of different origins that were incubated to attain both anoxic (less reducing) and anaerobic (microbially reducing) conditions. The reactivity of the anoxic sediments increased with pH and an increasing amount of Fe(II) added. A good electron balance between pCNB reduction and Fe(II) consumption was observed for anaerobic sediments of high solids loading (50 g/L), but not when solids loading was 5 g/L. Based on cluster and regression analysis, pCNB reactivity in the anaerobic sediments correlates strongly with aqueous Fe(II) concentrations for sediments with low organic carbon (OC) content (<4.2%), but with dissolved OC concentrations (DOC) for the sediments with high OC content (>6.4%). These observations indicate surface-associated Fe(II) and reduced DOC are the predominant reductants in the anaerobic sediments, and that aqueous Fe(II) and DOC will serve as readily measurable indicators of pCNB reactivity in these systems.

AB  - Water saturation is an important indicator of contaminant distribution and plays a governing role in contaminant transport within the vadose zone. Understanding the water saturation distribution is critical for both remediation and contaminant flux monitoring in unsaturated environments. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a method of remotely determining water saturation levels using gas phase partitioning tracers and time-lapse bulk electrical conductivity measurements. The theoretical development includes the partitioning chemistry for the tracers we demonstrate (ammonia and carbon dioxide), as well as a review of the petrophysical relationship governing how these tracers influence bulk conductivity. We also investigate methods of utilizing secondary information provided by electrical conductivity breakthrough magnitudes induced by the tracers. We test the method on clean, well characterized, intermediate-scale sand columns under controlled conditions. Results demonstrate the capability to accurately monitor gas breakthrough curves along the length of the column according to the corresponding electrical conductivity response, and to adequately determine partitioning coefficients, leading to accurate water saturation estimates. This work is motivated by the need to develop effective characterization and monitoring techniques for contaminated deep vadose zone environments, and provides a proof-of-concept toward uniquely characterizing and monitoring water saturation levels at the field scale and in three-dimensions using electrical resistivity tomography.

AB  - This study described the changes in paleosalinity over the last 10,000 yr in the coastal lake, Soetendalsvlei, on the southern coast of South Africa. Sediment cores collected in 2006 were radiocarbon and Pb-210 dated and analysed for geochemistry, stable isotopes and diatom assemblages. Results indicated that trophic status increased during periods of reduced salinity, as inferred from diatom assemblages and stable isotopes. As freshwater inflow increased to the lake, there was an increase in nutrients and terrestrial organic material input. Increases in salinity could be related to marine intrusion as a result of major marine transgression (similar to 8000 yr and similar to 4000 yr BP) events for the South African coastline. A comparison of the results with historical records showed that drought and flood cycles greatly influenced the paleo-salinity of the lake. Poor diatom preservation possibly due to high alkalinity was also found in this study and highlighted the importance of using multiple proxies in the reconstruction of paleo-environmental conditions. The trophic development in relation to sea level change inferred from this study, is in close agreement with similar studies undertaken in South American coastal systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The river typology 'volcanic rivers' represents a unique typology in the Mediterranean eco-region in Europe but its type-specific diatom assemblages are still poorly investigated. The main aims of this study were (i) to analyse the diatom diversity of this river type, (ii) to investigate the relationships between diatom diversity and environmental variables and (iii) to identify the characterizing diatom community structure of different environmental groups. To this end, we selected 13 streams located in central Italy, belonging to a single river type and covering the whole quality range from human impacted sites to those in 'reference conditions'. Most frequent and abundant diatom species found were Cocconeis placentula var. lineata, Planothidium lanceolatum, Rhoicosphenia abbreviata and Amphora pediculus. Species richness in reference and less impacted sites was not higher than in intermediate and heavily degraded ones, but non-metric multidimensional scaling (N-MDS) analysis revealed a substantial difference among their diatom community structure. The indicator species analysis defined the characteristic species of three environmental groups identified by N-MDS. The findings of this study represent a contribution to the knowledge on diatom communities of Mediterranean volcanic-siliceous rivers and provide information for a data-driven implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Italy for this specific river typology.

AB  - Leaching tests have demonstrated that metals and other inorganic contaminants are released from pulverised fuel ash (PFA) under laboratory conditions. Consequently, it is necessary to review the potential risks posed by large earthwork structures constructed of PFA. In this study, the findings of the recently completed risk assessment for unbound PFA in the Waste Protocols Project are compared to the results of equivalent risk assessments carried out using leachate data for PFA samples collected from the Barlow PFA storage mound at Drax Power Station. Current recommendations for an environmental code of practice for the construction of earthworks using PFA are considered in relation to the results of the generic risk assessments. A tiered methodology for the impact assessment, investigation and risk assessment to be adopted for the placement of PFA fill in large construction projects or within above ground storage mounds is presented. This methodology is intended to provide a framework for earthwork design engineers to use in order to ensure that a thorough assessment is made of the possible effects of PFA bulk fill earthworks or above ground storage mounds on the environment.

AB  - Leaching and external sulphate attack on concrete lead to dissolution of hydration products, mainly portlandite, and in case of ingress of sulphate ions to formation of expansive products such as gypsum and ettringite. Durability of concrete exposed to these environments is still based on prescriptive specifications. The aim of the study is to provide experimental data to design performance based tests and specifications for a comparative approach. Tests have been developed to study these degradations in controlled conditions at constant pH. A leaching test has been performed on concrete. Indicators can be deduced from the leaching test and they are sensitive to the variations of potential durability. An accelerated test using a high sulphate concentration has been performed on mortars. Expansion results are sensitive to mortar mix proportions and the test could be used to qualify cements or binders in a comparative approach. Concrete specimens are exposed to external sulphate attack at two levels of sulphate concentration to provide long-term data that can be used to study the relevance of the accelerated tests and models which are being developed. Results from both series of tests show a correlation between the resistance to leaching and the resistance to external sulphate attack. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Runoff from agricultural land into watercourses may transport and deposit animal-derived waste contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 onto beaches, which may in turn lead to human infection. To simulate contamination, freshwater mixed with cattle slurry containing E. coli O157:H7 was added to sand from three recreational beaches. The sand was then maintained in a dry state (nontidal) or subjected to a repeated seawater tidal simulation. The pathogen could still be recovered from all sands by day 5. Although survival of the pathogen did not statistically vary between sands of different origin under nontidal conditions, significant differences in numbers occurred between sands when subject to tidal simulation. In the tidal simulations, a considerable proportion of the E. coli O157:H7 rapidly dissipated from sand into the seawater. In a separate experiment, the activity of bioluminescent (lux-marked) E. coli O157:H7 cells was monitored in various mixtures of contaminated runoff water and seawater over 5 days. Pathogen activity declined with increasing seawater concentration; however, cells remained viable in all treatments over the 5-day period. The addition of nutrients to water rapidly increased pathogen activity in all treatments. Our findings highlight the resilience of E. coli O157:H7 in aquatic and marine environments.

AB  - The shores of the Golden Horn-once most important seaport of the region-represented throughout history a romantic and recreational venue. This tributary to the Bosphorus, however, became seriously polluted with the extensive industrialization and rapid population growth in Istanbul over the past century. Two main tributaries, the Alibeykoy and the Kagithane, dumped both liquid and solid waste from residential areas and industry (small and large-scale) into the Golden Horn. As a result of this pollution, the landward three to four kilometers of the estuary became swamped with sediment. The dominance of anaerobic activity resulted in a highly unpleasant smell, and the shallow depth as one progressed up the bay restricted navigation. In early 1997 The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality began a dredging operation and gradually diverted all domestic and industrial wastewater discharge from the Golden Horn. Since then there have been remarkable improvements in water quality.
   This paper presents the state of eutrophication through the water body of the Golden Horn; parameters such as DO, TKN, NH3-N, NO3-N, the total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved phosphorus (PO4-P), phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a have been were analyzed in samples of water taken from various points in the Golden Horn. The presence of DO and the phytoplankton, both indicators of primary productivity in an aquatic body, has been evaluated in relation to former conditions.

AB  - The length of the snow-free season has a significant influence on reproduction and growth in northern alpine environments, and these life history traits may provide sensitive indicators of the responses of organisms to climate change. We examined growth rates and timing of parturition of collared pikas (Ochotona collaris) from 1995-2002 in the Ruby Range, Yukon Territory, Canada. Growth rates were best described using a Gompertz model, in which the asymptotic mass, determined from the average male and female weights, was 157 g, the growth rate constant (K) was 0.0557, and the age at inflection (1) was 18.12 days, for a birth weight of 10 g. The maximum growth rate for North American pikas (O. collaris and O. princeps) increased with latitude, with maximum growth rates being approximately one-third greater in northern populations where the snow-free season is less than three months long. The mean parturition date varied significantly among years from 3 June to 3 July, and delayed parturition was correlated with indices of high snow accumulation and, to a lesser extent, late spring snowmelt. However, parturition date did not significantly affect the subsequent over-winter survival of juveniles in this population, suggesting that pikas are able to adjust to seasonal uncertainty associated with highly variable spring conditions.

AB  - The work is aimed at die study of changes in structure and quantity of epicuticular waxes of birch (Betula pendula) leaves in the air-polluted region of die Krusne hory Mts (Ore Mts, Erzgebirge). Samples were taken in the course of three years, regularly twice during the vegetation period on two localities of the air-polluted region and on regions without air pollution. On the air-polluted areas the destruction of epicuticular waxes increases with increasing altitudes of forest stands. This phenomenon is accompanied by a shrinkage of epicuticular waxes on leaves, In the last two years there was a considerable decrease in air pollution load on the whole territory of the Ore Mts, which resulted in a lesser destruction of epicuticular waxes and in an increase of the total amount of those waxes on leaves. This favourable change manifested itself at the most with stands in higher attitudes. In spite of the environmental recovery in the Czech Republic, die air pollution in die region of the Ore Mts is still higher than it would correspond to the good growth conditions for birch. The stands are continually being weakened by die immission stress together with action of the unfavourable climate. The epicuticular waxes can serve as a bioindicator of die immission load.

TI  - Magnetic susceptibility as indicator of environmental pollution of soils in Tallinn
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH PART A-SOLID EARTH AND GEODESY
LA  - English
AB  - Low-field magnetic susceptibility (kappa) and concentration of 40 elements were determined for 531 samples collected from top-soils on the territory of the biggest industrial centre of Estonia. This study was carried out during a small-scale geochemical mapping and monitoring of soils in the frame of the project "Urban geochemistry of Tallinn" supported by NATO. The main purpose was to establish the sources of pollution and to study applicability of kappa for determining geochemical anomalies. Relationship between kappa and element concentrations in the topsoil was studied by means of correlation and factor analyses. Higher than average kappa values were observed in soils on the territory of phosphorite deposits at Maardu. The susceptibility anomaly is caused by particular geological circumstances and can be related to high contents of ferromagnetic minerals in the host rocks. Strong positive correlation of magnetic susceptibility with Cr, Pb, Zn and Cu observed in soils from the central part of the city are conditioned by industrial contamination mainly by metalworking factories and by traffic. These heavy metals, known as the most hazardous elements, are easily extracted by plants from the soils in the studied area. In addition to traditional geochemical mapping, the magnetic susceptibility was successfully applied in determining heavy metal pollution of soils on the city territories.

AB  - Given the difficulty in quantifying the interparticle forces, both experimentally and numerically, most studies have considered only the humidity effect in powder caking. In this work, the interparticle forces in caked powders were quantified using the simplified Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model to account for all the material and environmental factors that influences powder caking. The cohesion energy density, which is the ratio of cohesive energy to volume of the particle, was used as the indicator of caking in powders. Simulated force chain network was used to track the relay of interparticle forces (IPFL) under compression. The model was validated experimentally by using caked isomalt powder. At a consolidation pressure of 9 kPa, an increase in moisture from 6 to 8% increased the predicted IPFL from 0.41 to 1.31 N while the experimentally measured IPFEL ranged from 0.33 to 1.11 N. The corresponding cohesion energy density varied from 4.05 to 6.98 MJ/m(3). This study shows the potential of using cohesion energy density as the predictor and indicator of powder caking. The conditions at which a powder is stored can be related to the cohesion energy density which then can be used as an input parameter for analyzing the caking behavior. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An important management strategy for the development of sustainable agriculture in orchards is the management of ground cover. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the effects of ground cover on fruit yield and quality. We performed a meta-analysis of 580 observations collected from 116 peer-reviewed field studies, to assess the effects of ground cover on fruit yield and quality indicators. Overall, ground cover significantly increased fruit yield, soluble solid content, sugar content, and vitamin C content by 6.98%, 6.77%, 7.83%, and 14.59%, respectively, and significantly reduced fruit acidity by 10.63%. The effects of ground cover on fruit yield and quality were greater in subtropical regions and semi-humid, humid zone. These effects also mostly depended on ground cover types. Cover crops and mulch both significantly improved fruit quality. However, compared to clean tillage practice, legume cover crops substantially enhanced fruit yield while non-legume cover crops significantly decreased fruit yield. This effect was attributed to greater soil moisture and fertility with legume cover crops. Our analysis synthesized the scientific evidence on ground cover management to help orchard managers and policy makers improve orchard fruit yield and quality.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of different plant growth promoters (PGPs) such as ascorbic acid (500 mu M), thiourea (250 mu M) and moringa leaf extract (3%) to mitigate salinity stress (120 mM NaCl) in four different milk thistle [Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn.] ecotypes from Faisalabad (FSD), Gujranwala (GUJ), Kallar Kahar (KK), and Quetta (QTA) under field conditions for two years (2017-2018). In the present study, oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and activities of different antioxidant enzymes and levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants were significantly differed among ecotypes, salinity, and PGPs. Supplementation with ascorbic acid and moringa leaf extract improved antioxidant defense machinery during the acclimation process against salinity, and milk thistle ecotypes represent their background of ecological zones and inherent tendency to face and confronting stress with improving antioxidant levels to a significant extent in varying ways. Ecotypic variations showed that QTA ecotype Followed by FSD, GUJ, and KK had more antioxidant capacity, with minimum reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, the correlation data revealed that MDA and H2O2 had a positive correlation with each other and showed a negative correlation with all the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants.

AB  - Winding condition assessment is an essential task for operating transformers, and the vibration method provides a low-cost and non-intrusive approach. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method based on vibration analysis is proposed, which converts the vibration monitoring data with load information into a vibration image. Then, a deep learning approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify the images belong to different classes. In the laboratory experiment, free vibration tests are performed on an on-load winding model, which are used to verify the relationship between the natural frequency and the electromagnetic force under different clamping forces. During the field experiment, transformers are divided into three categories, including normal, degraded and anomalous, and the proposed scheme is trained and tested by using the vibration samples acquired from more than 100 operating transformers. The performance of the CNN classifier under different input sizes is investigated, which achieves 98.3% overall accuracy. Besides, the confusion matrices obtained by other methods are compared, such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes classifier (NBC). The results show that the proposed scheme including the vibration image extraction method and the CNN classifier offers superior performance in winding fault diagnosis.

AB  - The properties of a soil, either in situ or at a hydraulic reclamation site, may change if influenced by the chemical status of the surroundings. Acidity, indicated by the pH, and magnesium (Mg2+), sometimes used to reinforce soil, are good indicators of the chemical environment. It is therefore worth investigating how acidity and Mg2+ affect the settling of dredged fill. In this study, a cylinder model test and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) titration were used to investigate the mechanisms behind self-weight consolidation settlement. The results indicated that the settlement process of the dredged fill occurred in three stages and that the consolidation settlement process of the dredged fill varied as the pH and mass percentage of Mg2+ varied. As the pH increased from an initial low value, the settlement amount and settlement rate of the dredged fill approximated to a quadratic function trend and increased first and peaked when the pH was 4 and then decreased, reflecting the influence of the mineral composition of the soil and the Zeta potential of the soil particles. Under medium pH conditions, the settlement amount and settlement rate increased in an approximately linear manner, reflecting increases in the mass percentage of Mg2+ and changes in the double electric layers on the clay mineral surface.

AB  - Coal extraction remains supported in many countries despite a global context challenging the industry. A large evidence base links coal with negative consequences for human health. Environmental assessments (EAs) are regulated in nearly every country to assess and set conditions for large industry projects, including coal mines, but tend to exclude health impacts. This study investigated the institutional dynamics surrounding the inclusion of health in coal mining EAs in New South Wales, Australia. Semi-structured interviews with varied stakeholders were supported by a review of legislation, relevant case law and media analysis. Using insights from theories on power and institutions the findings show how EA practice is influenced by the politicization of coal mining that excludes potentially negative narratives surrounding the known human health impacts of coal. Poor EA practice is compounded by legislative ambiguity and lack of conceptual understanding about assessing health. EA's legislative purpose of approving projects undermines confidence that a balanced assessment of impacts has been made. EA is seen as a pro-industry process that disempowers those with dissenting voices. The research explains how the institutional dynamics of a policy process like EA challenge its potential to meaningfully engage with the impact of coal mining on human health.

AB  - Native breeds of farm animals, despite their unique characteristics and adaptability to diverse and often adverse environmental conditions, are at risk due to their lower profitability and corresponding declining use. According to FAO data, there are currently around 8800 livestock breeds in the world (http://www.fao.org/dad-is/en/ update: 09.11.2019), of which 17% have been assessed to be endangered. The objective of the study was to develop a model for estimating the risk status of Polish native breeds. The proposed new model is based on 3 factors: demographic, genetic, and socioeconomic. The last factor is composed of 6 elements: geographical concentration, demographic trend over the last 5 years, cultural value of a breed, parentage control, ex situ conservation and anthropogenic factors. Using the factors and elements above, among the exami n ed 30 breeds of cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, 1 was assessed as being critically endangered; 24 were determined to be endangered and in need of conservation; 5 were less endangered, but in need of constant monitoring. Out of 35 populations of poultry 29 were assessed as endangered as they were being kept in only single public collections. Six flocks of ducks were given a critical risk status, due to a very low number of females.

AB  - Along with recognition of environmental effects on the performance and welfare of livestock animals, studies have been proposing new methodologies and parameters to diagnose the heat stress of animals through the physical properties of air. This article aims to present the state-of-the-art on the use of the specific enthalpy of air as an indicator of heat stress in livestock animals. As a starting point, conceptual considerations were made about the connection between homoeothermic animals and the environment. Variables for heat stress evaluation based on psychrometric air properties are then described, including dry bulb temperature and relative humidity, which are often used microclimate variables, and the specific enthalpy of dry air, which acts as a thermal comfort index. Final considerations highlight the recent history of the use of specific enthalpy of air equations as indicators of heat stress in livestock animals, with the intention of better understanding the relationship between animals and the environment. As a conclusion, the specific enthalpy of air is recommended as an indicator in the assessment of livestock housing conditions as, unlike other indices, it is based on thermodynamic air properties and not on linear regressions.

AB  - Paleoenvironmental reconstructions in coastal environments have been carried out using indicators of relative sea level oscillation (RSL), among them, mollusk shells, beachrocks and sedimentary records. Data from eleven geological-geotechnical drilling cores (from 15 m to 30 m long) distributed along the Ipanema - Leblon coastline and on the edge of the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon and respective stratigraphic profiles were analyzed in this work. Ten radiocarbon ages obtained from shell samples calibrated to eliminate the effect of reservoir were used to perform the time evolution of the study area.
   The obtained results allowed to identify five distinct stages on the sedimentary evolution of the Southern Zone of the Rio de Janeiro City related to the Holocene RSL variations: the first stage under continental environmental conditions, with sea level approximately 4.5 m below the current; the second stage corresponding to a paleo-cove formed due to the sea level rising; the third stage associated with the mid-Holocene maximum transgression, in which the entire study area was flooded; the fourth stage following the gradual lowering of the RSL and marked by the formation of a paleo-bay; the fifth stage corresponding to the current configuration of the coastline.

AB  - Burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.) are important indicators of mesotrophic water conditions, and have been studied for several decades in conjunction with the changing trophic status of western Lake Erie. However, most studies on the biology of burrowing mayflies have failed to differentiate between immature H. limbata and H. rigida, the life stages that are most commonly collected. We developed a simple molecular assay to facilitate species-level identification of the two mayflies as an easier alternative to sequencing the COI gene. We analyzed a total of 152 cytochrome c oxidase, subunit I barcoding sequences from the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) for these mayfly species and developed a diagnostic primer set. We tested our primers on 46 random burrowing Lake Erie mayfly nymphs using both conventional PCR and qPCR. Results of the two methods were consistent and unambiguous. Sequencing of the COI barcoding region in the mayflies confirmed that the PCR assays correctly identified mayflies in all cases. Our assay is simple and effective, and will facilitate species-level identification of burrowing mayflies in future studies on their biology where the two species co-occur.

AB  - In order to explore the factors and their complex mechanism affecting the price dynamics under the clean development mechanism (CDM), this article employs the secondary Certified Emission Reduction (sCER) carbon price as the study object, and analyzes its influencing factors from aspects of the international carbon-reduction policies, macroeconomic fluctuations, energy and similar carbon products prices. The innovation of this paper lies in: Introducing necessary factor (the developing countries pricing power) and the application of several international representative indicators to underline the "world" nature of CDM; utilizing different econometric models to obtain noteworthy and more robust results. The authors test the theoretical findings with multiple stationary time series from the launch of CDM to present (2008-2016). The results reveal that sCER price fluctuation shows the characteristic of asymmetry and substantial persistence. There is a strong statistically significant relationship between macroeconomic conditions, coal and oil prices, with the price of sCER. The authors discover that the pricing power of developing countries indeed has a clear but small impact on the sCER price changes, whereas the price elasticity of supply under CDM is so weak. The interaction between EU emission allowances (EUAs) and sCER presents a shift from dependency to substitution.

AB  - This study was conducted on the soils originating from a reclamation area of the former sulphur mine in Tarnobrzeg, Poland. Soil was sampled 16 years after the completion of mining works with the open-pit method at Machow, as well as 7 years after sulphur mining via the 'smelting' method in the Jeziorko mine was abandoned. Several biological parameters were examined: soil respiration, soil microbial biomass and the activity of rhodanese and arylsulphatase enzymes taking part in sulphur transformation within the site's soils. The soils showed a high total sulphur and sulphates content. The SO42- constituted a large fraction of total sulphur, in some cases, exceeding 80% or even 95% of total sulphur. The soil pH decreased due to the degrading effects of sulphur mining. In the soils studied from the locations with the lowest soil pH value, no activity of arylsulphatase was reported and the activity of rhodanese was lowest. The highest soil respiration values were recorded from the 0-5 cm layer in the areas covered with forest vegetation. A high soil respiration value at the waste heap at Machow wherein a very high concentration of S-tot and SO42- was observed can be due to the ability of fungi to produce hyphal strands and to survive unfavourable conditions.

AB  - The study aims to assess the landscape vulnerability to forest fire susceptibility of Rudraprayag district, India, using frequency ratiomodel. Firstly, forest-fire-affected pixels were identified by using normalized difference burning ratio and ground survey. A total of 19,834 forest fire pixels were identified; out of these, 14,876 (70%) pixels were used to generate forest fire susceptibility map and the remaining 4958 affected pixels (30%) were used to validate the susceptibility model. Twelve forest fire conditioning indicators were selected: slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, elevation, topographic wetness index, soil texture, land use/land cover, normalized difference moisture index, annual average rainfall, road buffer, distance from settlement and distance from drainage to build the forest fire susceptibility model. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to validate the forest fire susceptibility map, and 85% prediction accuracy was found. Final landscape vulnerability to forest fire susceptibility was assessed by using overlay function in GIS environment. The result shows that 73% area of Rudraprayag district falls into low and moderate susceptibility classes and approximately 16% area falls into high and very high susceptibility classes. Landscape vulnerability analysis revealed that moderate and very high forest fire susceptibility occupies the inaccessible parts of the core forest area of the district.

AB  - The timing of the colonization of Sardinia by mammalian fauna and anatomically modern humans (AMH) is currently under debate. The understanding of the geological and palaeoclimatological conditions that characterized the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene is essential to investigate colonization processes and requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach. In this research we combine for the first time new radiometric dating, field evidence of relative sea-level changes (RSL), sea-level and glacial-isostatic adjustment modelling, stratigraphical, palaeontological, palaeoecological and isotope analyses that were performed on sites and finds from the Porto Conte and Capo Caccia area (Alghero, MAI Sardinia). The most important Late Pleistocene fossiliferous deposits in Sardinia have been discovered in this part of the island. Modelled palaeogeographical reconstructions of the Porto Conte area combined with the inferred environmental context and chronology of Late Pleistocene faunal assemblages from Medusa-Dragonara Cave suggest that Homo sapiens did not inhabit this area before the Holocene. Our results support the hypothesis that human presence in Sardinia during the Last Glacial Maximum was at best sporadic. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Depressive disorders lack objective physiological measurements to characterize the affected population and facilitate study of relevant mechanisms. The melanopsin-mediated light signaling pathway may contribute to seasonal variation and can be measured non-invasively by pupillometry. We prospectively studied changes in melanopsin-mediated pupillary constriction in 19 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 10 control across the summer and winter solstices. The melanopsin-mediated response, as measured by the pupil's sustained constriction six s after a high intensity blue light stimulus, was marginally attenuated in those with MDD relative to controls (p=0.071). The participants with MDD unexpectedly showed a significantly reduced transient pupillary response to low intensity red (p=0.011) and blue light (p=0.013), but not high intensity red and blue light. Sustained pupillary constriction in response to high intensity blue light was more pronounced with increasing daylight hours (p=0.037) and was more strongly related to objectively measured versus estimated light exposure. Melanopsin-mediated impairments in pupil response may serve as a biological marker for vulnerability to depression in low light conditions. Assessment of these and other responses to light stimuli, such as response to low intensity light, may be useful for the study of the neurobiology of MDD and related mood disorders.

AB  - The effect of insecticides (acephate and imidacloprid) on a freshwater microalga Chlamydomonas mexicana was investigated with respect to photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrate and protein contents, fatty acids composition and induction of stress indicators including proline, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). C. mexicana was cultivated with 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg L-1 of acephate and imidacloprid. The microalga growth increased with increasing concentrations of both insecticides up to 15 mg L-1, beyond which the growth declined compared to control condition (without insecticides). C. mexicana cultivated with 15 mg L-1 of both insecticides for 12 days was used for further analysis. The accumulation of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids), carbohydrates and protein was decreased in the presence of both insecticides. Acephate and imidacloprid induced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and increased the concentration of proline in the microalga, which play a defensive role against various environmental stresses. Fatty acid analysis revealed that the fraction of polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased on exposure to both insecticides. C. mexicana also promoted 25 and 21 % removal of acephate and imidacloprid, respectively. The biochemical changes in C. mexicana on exposure to acephate and imidacloprid indicate that the microalga undergoes an adaptive change in response to the insecticide-induced oxidative stress.

AB  - Floodplain surface topography is an important component of floodplain ecosystems. It is the primary physical template upon which ecosystem processes are acted out, and complexity in this template can contribute to the high biodiversity and productivity of floodplain ecosystems. There has been a limited appreciation of floodplain surface complexity because of the traditional focus on temporal variability in floodplains as well as limitations to quantifying spatial complexity. An index of floodplain surface complexity (FSC) is developed in this paper and applied to eight floodplains from different geographic settings. The index is based on two key indicators of complexity, variability in surface geometry (VSG) and the spatial organisation of surface conditions (SPO), and was determined at three sampling scales. FSC, VSG, and SPO varied between the eight floodplains and these differences depended upon sampling scale. Relationships between these measures of spatial complexity and seven geomorphological and hydrological drivers were investigated. There was a significant decline in all complexity measures with increasing floodplain width, which was explained by either a power, logarithmic, or exponential function. There was an initial rapid decline in surface complexity as floodplain width increased from 1.5 to 5 km, followed by little change in floodplains wider than 10 km. VSG also increased significantly with increasing sediment yield. No significant relationships were determined between any of the four hydrological variables and floodplain surface complexity.

AB  - Background
   Continuous culture devices can be used for various purposes such as establishing reproducible growth conditions or maintaining cell populations under a constant environment for long periods. However, commercially available instruments are expensive, were not designed to handle small volumes in the milliliter range, and can lack the flexibility required for the diverse experimental needs found in several laboratories.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We developed a versatile continuous culture system and provide detailed instructions as well as a graphical user interface software for potential users to assemble and operate their own instrument. Three culture chambers can be controlled simultaneously with the proposed configuration, and all components are readily available from various sources. We demonstrate that our continuous culture device can be used under different modes, and can easily be programmed to behave either as a turbidostat or chemostat. Addition of fresh medium to the culture vessel can be controlled by a real-time feedback loop or simply calibrated to deliver a defined volume. Furthermore, the selected light-emitting diode and photodetector enable the use of phenol red as a pH indicator, which can be used to indirectly monitor the bulk metabolic activity of a cell population rather than the turbidity.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This affordable and customizable system will constitute a useful tool in many areas of biology such as microbial ecology as well as systems and synthetic biology.

AB  - Environmental assessments have been developed with increasing emphasis since the wide-scale emergence of environmental concerns in the 1970s. However, after decades there is still plenty of room left for development. These assessments are also rapidly becoming more and more crucial as we seem to be reaching the boundaries of the carrying capacity of our planet. Assessments of the emissions from the built environment and especially of the interactions between human communities and emissions are in a very central role in the quest to solve the great problem of sustainable living. Policy-makers and professionals in various fields urgently need reliable data on the current conditions and realistic future projections, as well as robust and scientifically defensible models for decision making. This recognition was the main motivation to call for this Focus Issue, and the published contributions truly highlight the same point. This editorial provides brief summaries and discussions on the 16 articles of the Focus Issue, depicting the several interesting perspectives they offer to advance the state of the art. Now we encourage academics, practitioners, government, industry, individual consumers, and other decision makers to utilize the available findings and develop the domain of environmental assessment of the built environment further. Indeed, we hope that this Focus Issue is merely a kernel of a significantly large future body of literature.

AB  - In this paper, I develop an optimization model for integrated coastal management in which decisions arise from an area-based algorithm that minimizes predicted damage caused by beach erosion and inshore flooding, while accounting for economic, social, and environmental losses. The model favors the involvement of stakeholders in coastal management, but does not use complicated assessment procedures for non-economic indicators or relative weights to combine economic, social, and environmental indicators. Instead, the integration between economic activities or properties and the environmental status and landscape is represented objectively and non-linearly by referring to initial and sustainability conditions, combined with budgetary and environmental constraints. The model successfully accounted for both human and environmental dynamics by depicting delayed effects, neighborhood externalities, and feedback effects. It calculated a single optimal value for each integrated coastal management strategy, which permitted the support of future decisions and the evaluation of past decisions. The model's insights were based on reliable estimates, with reliability determined by calculating the confidence level. The model was successfully applied to Italy's Comacchio coastal municipality, where it revealed the priorities for optimal beach nourishment, dune fixation, and residential and holiday housing development based on budget constraints, beach losses, flood damage, pollution impacts, and land-use constraints.

AB  - Fallow with Psiadia altissima is one of the most common post-slash and burn' vegetation successions described in the evergreen forests of eastern Madagascar. Some fallows consist of almost pure stands of this species, of which the leaves produce an essential oil offering international commercial interest. The present research aims to evaluate the production potential of essential oil derived from different fallows rich in P. altissima. The study has revealed that fallows aged 4 and 6 years since the last crop abandonment produce the most essential oil (around 20 l ha(-1)), but relative to fallow duration, the youngest fallows (1- or 2-year-old) are the most productive, respectively producing 12 and 6 l ha(-1) year(-1). Additionally, the trees from the youngest fallows have a substantial capacity for regeneration from coppice shoots, on condition that the cut is performed well above the root collar. Although farmers earn five times less from harvesting leaves than from cultivating rice from tavy, the possibility is there for them to complement their income and diversify their production. The overall results show that sustainable exploitation of fallows of P. altissima is a conceivable option. However, this can only be achieved through an integrated approach that takes into account the environmental and social constraints associated with the development of this new activity.

AB  - Diatom-based models to infer nutrient concentrations are proven robust indicators, but evidence suggests that in the future these models will be little improved by using larger training sets. I present a simple means to summarize the water quality (WQ) data from a suite of coastal Great Lakes locations and develop a diatom-based WQ model using standard weighted-averaging methods. A one-dimensional WQ index was derived by summarizing measured environmental data (nutrients, pigments, solids) using dimension-reducing ordination and calculating the primary WQ gradient of interest. Evaluations of weighted-averaging diatom model predictions (WQ index model: r(jackknife)(2) = 0.62, RMSEP = 1.32) indicate that the model has reconstructive power similar to a comparative model for total phosphorus concentrations (TP model: r(jackknife)(2) = 0.65, RMSEP = 0.26 log[mu g/L + 1]), but that predictive bias was lower for the WQ model. Also, inferred WQ index data had a higher correlation to adjacent watershed characteristics than inferred TP data. We attribute this to the ability of an integrated WQ index to better characterize the overall quality of a site than a single nutrient variable such as phosphorus. The diatom-based WQ model may be advantageous for management where it is necessary to provide a summary inference of water quality condition at a coastal locale.

AB  - We tested the effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) on the murine model of ulcerative colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate. The effect of LcS was tested either as a prophylactic 10 days before the onset of the disease, simultaneously with ulcerative colitis induction or continued 10 days after the disease was induced. LcS was not able to prevent the disease induction in any of the experiments. However, important clinical parameters including blood anemia indicators, body weight, and organ weight were improved in the animals receiving LcS as compared with the ulcerative colitis-induced controls. Increased colonic epithelial regeneration in the LcS treated animals was observed in the chronic stage. The results seemed better for the simultaneous short LcS treatment where some parameters remained similar to the PBS controls, including disease activity scores measured in the acute stage. We can conclude that although LcS alone cannot prevent the induction of ulcerative colitis by dextran sodium sulphate, it can improve the clinical condition of the mice. This could imply important biological consequences for the human situation. Further studies including LcS or other probiotic bacteria together with the available treatment are encouraged.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of thermal remote sensing for estimating ecosystem surface CO2 flux. Ecosystem surface CO2 flux was measured by an eddy covariance method for more than 3 years, in conjunction with thermal and optical remote sensing measurements as well as micrometeorological, soil and plant measurements. The soil was Andisol (Hydric Hapludands), a humic volcanic ash soil, which is the major cultivated soil for upland crops in Japan. The soil surface CO2 flux under bare soil conditions was best correlated with the remotely sensed surface temperature, while air temperature was less well correlated and soil temperature and soil water content were poorly correlated. The relationship was well expressed by an exponential Q(10) function (r(2) =0.66, RMSE=0.098). The value of Q(10) and the threshold temperature at which the CO2 flux approached zero were estimated to be 1.47 and 10.0degreesC, respectively. Results suggested that the soil surface temperature had the dominant effect on the microbial respiration as well as on the physical processes determining the CO2 gas transfer at the soil-atmosphere interface. Remotely sensed surface temperature will provide useful information for investigation of CO2 transfer processes near the soil surface, as well as for quantitative assessment of ecosystem surface CO2 flux.

AB  - The role of water chemistry on metal bioavailability was investigated in river water affected by effluent-originated contamination with the aim to evaluate the effect of interactions between metal and river water toxicity. Two Lambro river sites, located upstream and downstream of a highly industrialized area in Northern Italy, were selected as study area and compared for copper bioavailability. The high-sensitivity chronic test based on S. capricornutum 72h-growth inhibition was used within an experimental framework which was set-up combining TRE (Toxicity Reduction Evaluation) with WER (Water Effect Ratio) procedures. While discriminating between toxicants, the sample treatments of LiChrolut solid phase extraction (SPE) and EDTA addition proved to be effective showing the role of the dissolved organic matter on metal toxicity. In spite of the original toxicity found in the downstream water (Dw) sample, copper bioavailability was lower than expected when the metal was experimentally added, the Dw-WER being three times higher than the upstream water (Uw)-WER. Effluent-originated organic ligands are suggested to have an important role in metal complexation, thus reducing copper toxicity. The link found between effluent contribution and complexing capacity, however, suggests the risk associated to the variability over time and flow conditions of the effluent itself.

AB  - Bioassays were carried out in the culture media for Vibrio-qinghaiensis sp.Nov-Q67 and the influences of alkalinity and different concentrations of chloride, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and natural derived fulvic acid (FA) on the labile concentration and toxicity of Cu were investigated. The labile concentration of Cu was obtained by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry with a double acidification method (DAM-DPASV). Changes in water alkalinity and chloride concentrations did not affect the labile concentration of Cu, but increases of alkalinity and concentrations of chloride reduced the toxicity on Q67 In the presence of EDTA and FA, both labile concentration of Cu and toxicity were reduced. By excluding Cu-carbonate complexes and Cu-chloride from labile concentration, a bioavailable concentration of Cu (or [Cu*]) was obtained and used to predict the acute toxicity of Cu on Q67. For natural waters, the labile concentration of Cu was measured by DAM-DPASV and [Cu*] was calculated by a MINTEQ A2 software based on composition of waters. This procedure was tested for Guanting Reservoir waters by spiking different concentration Cu. The results showed that [Cu*] was a good indicator for Cu toxicity and could be used in field conditions.

AB  - Ciliated protozoa have been widely used as water quality indicators because their main morphological characteristics are relatively simple to identify microscopically. The species and individual numbers in wastewater treatment systems are a consequence of the operational and environmental conditions of the process. The main objective of this research was to relate the effluent quality of a pilot aerated biofilter with the presence and relative abundance of ciliated protozoa when operated under different organic loading rates. The experimental work was done in a pilot aerated bioflter using 12 mm volcanic porous stones as filtering media and it was fed with municipal wastewater adjusting the experiments to 3 organic loading rates (3, 7, and 9 gCOD/m(2).d). Temperature in the filter varied from 11 to 14degreesC during the experimental work. COD and BOD removal rates do not change significantly with the different organic loads. Nitrification improves inversely to the organic load and it does not show dependence on the slight temperature changes observed. Eighteen species were identified as typical residents in wastewater systems. Free swimming species prefer higher organic loads. Crawling and attached species did not show significant changes with the organic load. According to the saprobity index of Pantle and Buck, the system, independently of the organic load, presented typical alpha-mesosaprobe level.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a heterogeneous condition with long-term consequences for individuals and families. Goal-oriented rehabilitation is often applied, but there is scarce knowledge regarding types of goals and goal attainment. This study describes goal attainment in persons in the chronic phase of TBI who have received an individualized, SMART goal-oriented and home-based intervention, compares goal attainment in different functional domains, and examines indicators of goal attainment. Goal attainment scaling (GAS) was recorded in the intervention group (n = 59) at the final session. The goal attainment was high, with 93.3% increased goal attainment across all goals at the final session. The level of goal attainment was comparable across domains (cognitive, physical/somatic, emotional, social). Gender, anxiety symptoms, self-reported executive dysfunction, and therapy expectations were indicators of goal attainment. These results indicate a potential for the high level of goal attainment in the chronic phase of TBI. Tailoring of rehabilitation to address individual needs for home-dwelling persons with TBI in the chronic phase represents an important area of future research.

AB  - We study an extraction site reclamation problem in a two-player differential game setting over a finite time horizon. Environmental regulation requires each firm to engage in reclamation efforts during the entire lifespan of the extraction site and to pay an abandonment reclamation fee at the end of its lease term for the unclaimed pollution caused by firms' activities. Firms determine their reclamation efforts in order to minimize their reclamation cost. We analyze and compare individual firms' choices and the pollution stock in the noncooperative and the cooperative cases by distinguishing between situations in which firms are homogeneous and heterogeneous. We study the case in which firms have different lease durations and different degrees of environmental liability. We show that the dynamics of the reclamation efforts may be substantially different under noncooperation and cooperation, and in both cases, it is mainly determined by how the rate of time preference and the growth rate of firms' liabilities compare. Moreover, in all scenarios, the reclamation efforts generally rise with the degree of liability and fall with the lease duration, suggesting that in order to promote better environmental outcomes, the regulators should carefully determine the lease conditions by introducing intra-term reclamation fees along with stringent environmental accountability.

AB  - Freshwater systems are projected to experience increased hydrologic extremes under climate change. To determine how small streams may be impacted by shifts in flow regimes, we experimentally simulated flow loss over the span of three summers in nine 50 m naturally fed stream channels. The aquatic insect community of these streams was sampled before, during, and after experimental drought treatments as well as following one unforeseen flood event. Abundance, richness, and beta diversity were measured as indicators of biotic effects of altered flow regimes. Abundance declined in proportion to flow loss. In contrast, we observed a threshold response in richness where richness did not decrease except in channels where losses of surface flow occurred and disconnected pools remained. The flood reset this pattern, but communities continued their prior trajectories shortly thereafter. Beta diversity partitions suggested no strong compositional shifts, and that the effect of drought was largely experienced uniformly across taxa until flow cessation. Pools served as a refuge, maintaining stable abundance gradients and higher richness longer than riffles. Upon flow resumption, abundance and richness returned to pre-treatment levels within one year. Our results suggest that many taxa present were resistant to drought conditions until loss in surface flow occurred.

AB  - Traffic areas have been the subject of interest due to the high antimony (Sb) concentrations in the topsoils and atmosphere. The release of Sb from brake pad abrasion into two texturally different standard soils was studied through a leaching experiment. The source abrasion was placed 1 cm below the surface of the soil column, which was saturated with water to the constant value (60%-70% of saturation). The soil solution was collected regularly in an identical regime for both investigated soils. For the sandy soil only 4% of the Sb from the source of the abrasion was leached, while the clay soil was able to drain up to 40% of Sb under the same conditions. Sb flow rates exhibited comparable breakthrough profiles for both soils, with the peak of maximum Sb release in the first 3 days and subsequent equilibration of the system over the next 5-15 days. With the repeated saturation, the maximum release shifted by about 10 days, with only half the amount of Sb leached. The clay soil represented a more balanced system in terms of Sb, Fe, and TOC migration, but a much greater contamination risk due to a significantly higher gradient of transported Sb.

AB  - The sustainable development of micro-hydropower (MHP) plants is a challenge for rural electrification in developing countries, especially in Indonesia, which has diverse ethnic groups, cultures, and traditions in several isolated locations due to its complex terrain. The uniqueness of a social situation in a location can affect the sustainable electrification development. This study aimed to assess the sustainable development of MHP plants in the Kasepuhan Ciptagelar, which has unique traditions and cultural characteristics. The assessment was conducted using the sustainable development indicator (SDI) method, the Ilskog method, which can include social, economic, environmental, technical, and institutional dimensions. Data were collected through field investigations and qualitative dialogs to understand the culture and ways of thinking. The results of the Ilskog method analysis revealed that the environmental dimensions had the highest scores, whereas economic dimensions had the lowest scores, indicating that the cultural background of the Kasepuhan Ciptagelar impacted the SDI scores. This was attributable to the decision of Kasepuhan's traditional leader, which strengthened the community commitment to renewable energy use. However, the cultural background adversely impacted monetary income to sustain MHP plants. This study proposed that community innovation and microcredit availability could improve productive activities, resulting in better economic conditions to sustain MHP plants.

AB  - In indoor environments such as hotels, the light intensity is generally insufficient for managing plants, and flower buds often fail to open. Lamps placed above (downward lighting) take up space. We assessed the applicability of lighting from underneath (upward lighting) for the indoor management of roses. We grew plants indoors in dim light for 2 weeks under three conditions: 1) without supplemental lighting, 2) with downward light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, and 3) with LED lighting. We quantified photosynthetic components (chlorophyll and rubisco) and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm, an indicator of plant health) to determine the effects of each treatment on the quality and photosynthetic abilities of the leaves. We determined the ratios of dead and opened flower buds to elucidate the effects of supplemental lighting on flower bud maturation. Management without supplemental lighting decreased the number of flowers and resulted in lower-leaf senescence. Downward LED lighting promoted blooming but also resulted in lower-leaf senescence. However, upward LED lighting promoted blooming and maintained the photosynthetic abilities of the leaves, including the lower leaves. This study shows a strong case for using upward LED lighting in appropriate settings for indoor plant management and LED-based horticulture.

AB  - The worldwide populace is rising steadily. Urbanization is likewise expanding quickly with the rising populace. Fast urbanization has considerably increased the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW). The MSW management issues have recently been analyzed through various assessment indicators and information and communication technologies (ICTs). This article provides an overview of applications of assessment indicators and ICTs for addressing the environmental issues of waste disposal and management in municipalities. The selection of indicators mainly depends on the stakeholders' specific requirements, such as waste management strategies, urban planning and development, human health, and energy generation. The literature analysis revealed that collection, sorting, recycling, cost efficiency, and environmental aspect were the leading indicators used in waste management studies. And these indicators reduce the complexity of systems and formulate evaluations easier for the decision-maker. Moreover, these are also helpful in assessing the improvement and reporting the waste condition to the expert. These analysis further revealed that information and communication technology is a requirement in the planning and managing of current solid waste disposal problems. The use of ICTs in waste management systems mitigates possible constraints regarding spot selection, inept waste disposal, waste collection monitoring, and proper recycling.

AB  - The contents and chemical speciation of vanadium(V) in different types of soil and soils with different particle were studied by the modified BCR method. The results indicated that the V content was in the order of as red soil > cinnamon soil > chernozem soil, and the content of V in red soil was as high as 264.9 mg/kg, which posesa potential risk to the environment and biosecurity. In cinnamon soil, V exhibitedan obvious gradation effect; that is, the content of V in fine particles was higher than in large particles. In addition, V(IV), with low toxicity, accounted for more than 87% of the total V in the three types of soil, and most V existed in the residual fraction. The pH was the main factor affecting the V valence state in the soil, and when the environmental conditions change due to various agricultural measures, such as applying fertiliser, long-term cultivation and intensive irrigation, V(IV) is easily oxidised to V(V) with high toxicity, and reduceable and oxidisable V is converted into an acid-soluble fraction, which leads to increased bioavailability and a potential threat to the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen environmental risk assessments and monitoring of heavy metals in cultivated soils, especially in areas with high background values.

AB  - In this work an algorithm that integrates the calculation procedure and the mathematical models useful for the determination of the energy efficiency indicators of the boiler of a 250 MW thermal power plant (TPP) was implemented, which has not been studied in previous research. Through the thermal and exergy balance of the steam generator, the indicators were calculated during test that considered four load conditions: 150, 180, 220 and 250 MW. Their average values were 49.95 t/h for the fuel consumption and 92.0% for the gross thermal efficiency. The average steam generation index was 13.4 vapor units produced per unit of fuel, while, the average specific fuel consumption was 231.9 g/kWh and the mitigation cost required by ecological trace was reduced in 3.1 USD/h. The exergy performance and the degree of exergy loss were 61.5 and 38.5% respectively. The proposed algorithm foresees the computation of the relative point and average errors between the measured and calculated values of the fundamental efficiency indicators, as well as the execution of technical-organizational actions in the steam boiler to improve its energy performance. Its further implementation will encompass the analysis of the impacts caused by the aforementioned actions and the corresponding thermo-energy balance of the TPP.

AB  - Vegetation phenology is one of the key indicators for assessing inter annual changes of ecosystems while crop phenology has crucial and practical importance for precise timing of farming practices of today's smart agriculture. The aim of this study is to develop and implement a procedure for filtering and processing daily satellite signals from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites for the operational derivation of vegetation indices and land surface phenology (LSP) metrics. Second, this work investigates and selects precisely adjusted parameters for the calculation of a specific LSP metric - the SOS (start of the season). The SOS obtained from the satellite data was compared with available in situ ground measurements at 80 sites with records from 2000-2012 across the Czech Republic. The coefficients of determination, R2, for the land surface phenology based on Earth observation and traditional ground phenology indicated differences between the two methods. However, the average R2 at all sites for agricultural land was 0.31 for winter wheat onset of leaf sheath elongation; the R2 exceeded 0.5 at 21 sites and was approximately 0.7 at some sites. The developed procedure proved suitable for operational monitoring of actual crop conditions and other influence factors that are important for drought monitoring.

AB  - This research was performed to test the effectiveness of the microclimate body cooling system which belongs to the group of active systems with liquid-cooled technology. The liquid cooling vest efficiency was observed concerning the physiological fitness of the standard protective set used in specific environmental conditions which imply increased thermal strain of the test subjects. Experimental results from the research are based on the examinations carried out in a thermo-physiological laboratory. Ten healthy male volunteers - test subjects aged (23.4 +/- 2.4 years, weight 74 +/- 7 kg, and height 184 +/- 9 cm) were exposed to thermal strain testing (40 degrees C temperature, 40 +/- 3 % relative humidity, without wind) and simultaneously to physical effort caused by walking on the treadmill at a speed of 5 km/h, during 45 minutes. Tests were performed in two variants: without any cooling system and with the KewlFlow Circulatory Cooling Vest with Cooler Kit. Throughout heat exposure, the subject's body core temperature (tympanic temperature - Tty), mean skin temperature, Tsk, and heart rate were measured. Furthermore, sweat rate was calculated in order to determine all changes in the water and electrolyte status. Experimental results confirm that the results of this study have recognized the benefits of a liquid-cooled vest in lowering the thermal strain.

KW  - POLICY
AB  - To satisfy passengers' experiential demand in scenic roads, a study on passengers' comfort in the aspect of horizontal curve design is stated in this study. A new indicator sideway force coefficient (SFC) describing passengers' comfort is introduced, which differs from lateral acceleration. The mechanism of SFC is provided depending on the dynamic balance condition of the vehicle on horizontal curve and SFCc representing passengers' comfort tolerance limitation is investigated. A large scale naturalistic driving experiments along a park road are conducted, and the SFCc value from naturalistic driving experiments is verified through numerical simulation of 15 horizontal curves from 5 scenic roads from the perspectives of both passengers' comfort and driving safety. The statistical analysis on data collected in field tests indicates that age and gender have no effect on SFCc, and the value of SFCc is determined as 0.291. The corresponding minimum radius limits under 20-60 km/h and superelevation 6%, 8%, and 10% are proposed. The numerical simulation denotes, when satisfying the comfort demand of passengers (SFC less than 0.291), the lateral distance path is in a safe range, which could also satisfy the safe driving requirements. Thus, SFCc and minimum radius limits proposed in this study are proved to be credible and appropriate for the curve design of horizontal alignment in scenic roads.

AB  - Bacterial diseases cause production failures in shrimp aquacultures. To understand environmental conditions and bacterial community dynamics contributing to white faeces disease (WFD) events, we analysed water quality and compared bacterial communities in water as well as in intestines and faeces of healthy and diseased shrimps, respectively, via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR of transmembrane regulatory protein (toxR), thermolabile haemolysin (tlh), and thermostable direct haemolysin genes of pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus as a proxy for virulence. WFD occurred when pH decreased to 7.71-7.84, and Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio dominated the aquatic bacterial communities. The disease severity further correlated with increased proportions of Alteromonas, Photobacterium, Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio in shrimp faeces. These opportunistic pathogenic bacteria constituted up to 60% and 80% of the sequences in samples from the early and advances stages of the disease outbreak, respectively, and exhibited a high degree of co-occurrence. Furthermore, toxR and tlh were detected in water at the disease event only. Notably, bacterial community resilience in water occurred when pH was adjusted to 8. Then WFD ceased without a mortality event. In conclusion, pH was a reliable indicator of the WFD outbreak risk. Dissolved oxygen and compositions of water and intestinal bacteria may also serve as indicators for better prevention of WFD events.

AB  - Fisetin (3,3 ',4 ',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a widely distributed natural flavonol. It interacts with albumin, and thereby generates a fluorescence signal quantitatively. Based on such optical characteristics, we postulated that fisetin was applicable to the quantitation of albumin as an indicator. To establish the fisetin-based albumin assay, we examined the optical properties of fisetin and fisetin-albumin complex. The assay conditions were fine-tuned to fit for the actual concentration of serum albumin and to generate an optimal signal with a high signal-to-background ratio. The reaction between fisetin and albumin was linear in a wide range of concentrations. Non-protein serum components did not interfere with the reaction. The reactivity of fisetin was apparently specific for albumin among serum proteins. Both plasma and serum were compatible with the assay. The samples could be stored in a refrigerator or a freezer without the loss of reactivity toward fisetin. The generation and decay rates of the signal were acceptable for manual handling. The recovery of fortified albumin in serum was confirmed and the assay was validated with human sera. Fisetin-based albumin assay is suitable for clinical laboratory testing, considering the simple and short procedure, high specificity and sensitivity, linearity over a wide range of albumin concentrations, and, presumably, potential automatability.

AB  - Water pollution that occurs in the Bulak canal Kenjeran Surabaya was caused by heavy metal Hg2+ and Cr6+ which have characteristics of preservation, bioaccumulation and bioaugmentation. The presence of heavy metal results in decreased water quality. One way to monitor the presence of heavy metals is to use organisms in an indicator or called bio-monitoring. The organisms recommended as bio-monitoring agents are biofilms. The purpose of this study was to analyze the content of Hg2+ and Cr6+ in biofilms, sediments and water in the Bulak canal, Kenjeran, Surabaya. The results showed that Hg2+ concentration on biofilm (93.12 mg/L) was higher than on sediment (1.70 mg/L) and water (1,06 mg/L). The Cr6+ concentration on biofilm (55,50 mg/L) was also higher than on sediment (0,31 mg/L) and water (0,42 mg/L). The results of Anova test showed that the values were significantly different between biofilms with sediment and water. While the results of water quality analysis were showed in normal condition; salinity (1 ppt), temperature (25-32 degrees C), current (0,035-0,081 m/s), depth (32-34 cm), DO (1,321,59 mg/L) and pH (7,14-7,7). Based on this study biofilms can be used as biomonitoring agents in lotic ecosystem.

AB  - Drought is a widespread natural hazard. In this study, the potential factors affecting spatiotemporal changes of drought in the Tarim River Basin (TRB), China, were investigated using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and multiple hydro-meteorological indicators such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil moisture index (SSI), and terrestrial water storage (TWS). The following major conclusions were drawn. (1) Inconsistent variations between SPIs/SSIs and TWS in the TRB indicate a groundwater deficit in 2002-2012. (2) The results of EOF indicate that soil moisture in the TRB was significantly affected by precipitation. However, the variations between the EOFs of SSIs and those of TWS were not identical, which indicates that soil water had less effect on TWS than groundwater. (3) Drought evaluations using SPI and SSI showed that a long drought duration occurred over a long accumulation period, whereas a high frequency of drought was related to a short accumulation period. (4) Hydrological features related to extreme soil moisture conditions in the TRB could also be influenced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The findings of this study are significant for use in drought detection and for making water management decisions.

AB  - Physiological stress in wildlife can be a useful indicator of a population's response to environmental factors. By using non-invasive endocrinological techniques, such as fecal sampling, potential confounding factors associated with the stress of capture can be avoided. A potential drawback of fecal sampling, however, is degradation of samples which may produce aberrant measurements of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites. In vertebrates, glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone, become elevated in response to stress. We sought to gauge the reliability of measurement of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fecal samples exposed to a temperate winter with substantial snow cover and cold temperatures for up to 90 days, by repeatedly subsampling fecal samples every 10 days and performing a corticosterone enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Measurements of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites at 10 days were consistent with initial measurements, after which (20 days) they became aberrant following a period of thawing. Consequently, glucocorticoid metabolite levels in feces appear to remain stable under ambient conditions if temperatures remain below freezing at least for 10 days. While it's possible that samples may remain useful beyond this time frame based on previous laboratory studies of samples stored in a freezer, further work is needed to determine how samples weather in situ under extreme cold (e.g. Arctic) or periods of partial thawing.

AB  - With continued urbanization, public transport infrastructure, e.g., subways, is expected to be built in historically industrial areas. To minimize the transfer of volatile organic compounds and metalloids like arsenic from industrial areas into subway environments and reduce their impact on public health, the transport of pollutants in soil was simulated in this study. During numerical simulations of a contaminated site, the pollutant (arsenic) was transported from layers of higher to lower concentration, and concentration changes were particularly evident in the early simulation stages. The pollutant was transported in soil along the direction of groundwater flow and spread from the center to the periphery of the contaminated zone without inputs from pollution sources. After approximately 400 days, the concentration of all layers became uniform, with slow decreases occurring over time. The pollutant supply rate had a major influence on the pollutant diffusion distance. When other conditions were kept constant, higher supply rates resulted in longer diffusion distances. The simulation results show that a diaphragm wall of a certain depth can effectively control the diffusion of pollutants in soil. These results can be used to improve environmental assessments and remediation efforts and inform engineering decisions during the construction of urban infrastructure at sites affected by historical pollution.

AB  - Agricultural monitoring and assessment based on satellite data increasingly gains importance due to the growing number of available satellite sensors with high geometric and temporal resolution. Such tasks often require multiple images acquired on specific dates that among others account for inter-annual phenological variations to provide accurate results. This contribution presents an approach that links peaks of spectral separability profiles to crop phenological phases. The phases are spatially interpolated using a phenological model and ground observations. The profiles show the respective temporal development of the F-measure which is used as indicator for class-wise separability. It originates from binary classifications of vegetation indices computed for each set of a satellite data archive covering multiple years. Acquisition dates, which repeatedly show a separability maximum define phenological indicator phases. Potential alternative phases can be also defined. Experiments based on multi-temporal RapidEye satellite imagery were performed for three crops at two German test sites under different environmental conditions. The results showed that the phases yellow ripeness, heading and flowering can function as indicator phases for high spectral separability of winter barley, winter wheat and winter rapeseed. We could identify at least two identical, stable indicator phases per crop type for both test sites, which suggests the transferability and robustness of the presented approach.

AB  - Gullies formed in the Velhas River basin in Brazil have been filled with urban construction waste for physical stabilisation purposes. Aimed at rehabilitating gullies, we selected woody species from the Brazilian Cerrado that can grow on rocky substrates under greenhouse conditions. An assessment was made regarding plant growth in both rocky and natural soil substrates by analysing the height, diameter, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, plant water content, root occupation and architecture. Principal component analysis and Chi-squared tests segregated rock-tolerant species based on the specific influence on root dry and fresh weights. Fast-growing species reduced the emergence of their lateral roots under rocks, compromising their growth in height and biomass production. In contrast, slow-growing woody species were particularly suitable for gully rehabilitation because these species exhibited a genetic pattern of low lateral root emergence that prevented damage to their roots. Most slow-growing species demonstrated a similar growth pattern in both substrates, and some of them, such as Copaifera langsdorffii, achieved better growth in height and biomass production on rocks than on soil, a finding attributed to the root plastic response involving primary root elongation and lateral root emergence. Therefore, slow-growing species are recommended for gully rehabilitation procedures.

AB  - Information on situation of air pollution is critically needed as input in four disciplines of research including risk management, risk evaluation, environmental epidemiology, as well as for status and trend analysis. Two normal practices were identified to evaluate daily air pollution situation; first, pollution magnitude has been treated as the common indicator, and second, the analysis was often conducted based on hourly average data. However, the information on the magnitude level alone to represent the pollution condition based on a rigid point data such as the average was seen as insufficient. Thus, to fill the gap, this study was conducted based on continuously measured data in the form of curves, which is also known as functional data, whereby pollution duration is emphasised. A statistical method based on curve ranking was used in the investigation. The application of the method at Klang, Petaling Jaya and Shah Alam air quality monitoring stations located in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, has shown that pollution duration decreases as the magnitude increases. Shah Alam has the longest pollution duration at low and medium magnitude levels. Meanwhile, all the three stations experienced quite a similar length of average pollution duration for the high magnitude level, that is, about 2.5 days. It was also shown that the occurrence of PM10 pollution at the area is significantly not random.

AB  - Copepods of the genus Pseudocalanus are important members of zooplankton communities in temperate and polar shelf regions, but few studies have focused on their species-specific biology due to the very subtle morphological differences between the species. We assess the distribution, population structure and production of four co-occurring species of Pseudocalanus across the Chukchi Sea during 2004, 2009 and 2012. Our approach used a combination of microscopic identification and species-specific polymerase chain reaction to discriminate between the species. Currently, the arctic P. acuspes dominates the genus (50-90%), with the relative distribution of species closely linked to water mass distribution and variations in physical properties, making Pseudocalanus important indicators of water mass origin. Although the temperate P. newmani had a significant presence throughout the Chukchi Sea, its stage distribution suggests that they recruit poorly in cold waters. Direct temperature-manipulation experiments further suggest that the reproductive activity of the two temperate species is inhibited at low temperatures, while the arctic P. acuspes exhibits reduced fitness and lower reproductive capacity when temperatures are increased to 10 degrees C. Our results suggest that shifting oceanographic patterns and climate warming will have unequal impact on this genus, arising from species-specific differences in life histories and tolerance to environmental conditions.

AB  - The primary cilium is a solitary hair-like organelle on the cell surface that serves as an antenna sensing ever-changing environmental conditions. In this review, we will first recapitulate the molecular basis of the polymodal sensory function of the primary cilia, specifically focusing on transient receptor potential (TRP) channels that accumulate inside the organelle and conduct calcium ions (Ca2+). Each subfamily member, namely TRPP2 TRPP3, TRPC1 and TRPV4, is gated by multiple environmental factors, including chemical (receptor ligands, intracellular second messengers such as Ca2+), mechanical (fluid shear stress, hypo-osmotic swelling), or physical (temperature, voltage) stimuli. Both activity and heterodimer compositions of the TRP channels may be dynamically regulated for precise tuning to the varying dynamic ranges of the individual input stimuli. We will thus discuss the potential regulation of TRP channels by local second messengers. Despite its reported importance in embryonic patterning and tissue morphogenesis, the precise functional significance of the downstream Ca2+ signals of the TRP channels remains unknown. We will close our review by featuring recent technological advances in visualizing and analyzing signal transduction inside the primary cilia, together with current perspectives illuminating the functional significance of intraciliary Ca2+ signals.

AB  - Highly coordinated and coincidental patterns of activity-dependent mechanisms ("fire together wire together'') are thought to serve as inductive signals during synaptogenesis, enabling neuronal pairing between specific sub-sets of excitatory partners. However, neither the nature of activity triggers, nor the "activity signature'' of long-term neuronal firing in developing/regenerating neurons have yet been fully defined. Using a highly tractable model system comprising of identified cholinergic neurons from Lymnaea, we have discovered that intrinsic trophic factors present in the Lymnaea brain-conditioned medium (CM) act as a natural trigger for activity patterns in post-but not the presynaptic neuron. Using microelectrode array recordings, we demonstrate that trophic factors trigger stereotypical activity patterns that include changes in frequency, activity and variance. These parameters were reliable indicators of whether a neuron expressed functional excitatory or inhibitory nAChRs and synapse formation. Surprisingly, we found that the post-but not the presynaptic cell exhibits these changes in activity patterns, and that the functional expression of excitatory nAChRs required neuronal somata, de novo protein synthesis and voltage gated calcium channels. In summary, our data provides novel insights into trophic factor mediated actions on neuronal activity and its specific regulation of nAChR expression.

AB  - The study of climate changes is most often based on the analysis of time series of temperature and precipitation in urban areas and the increase in the emission of gases having a greenhouse effect. On the other hand, the selection of representative and relevant stations and comprehensive analysis of climate indicators lead to better and more exact assessments on climate changes at the regional level. In order to connect climate changes with agricultural, biological, socio-economic, and tourism databases, the paper deals with the dynamic analysis of changes in thermal component expressed through the values of regional climate indices in four climatological stations with different geographical positions in Serbia. There are significant differences between the two time series data (1961-1990 and 1991-2013) on temperature and humidity, precipitation, insolation, and wind speed. However, after using the climatic indices as a tool for assessing climate changes, the results of the study suggest the relative influence of the thermal component on the change of climate indices, with a slight increase in the index of significance for human activities. Relying on the results of this alternative approach to the study of climate changes, the fact remains that the climate is not fixed but highly variable factor that should be taken into consideration in terms of monitoring, evaluation, and management of the area.

AB  - Bryophytes constitute an important component of tropical rain forests, which provide microhabitats favorable for their establishment. Bryophytes are also quite responsive to changes in microclimate, which makes them good bioindicators. This study aimed to determine the diversity and distribution of bryophytes in upper and lower montane forests of the Chapada Diamantina region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. To that end, we studied community aspects such as richness, diversity, substrates colonized, life forms and floristic similarity between areas and regions. In 2007 and 2008, we collected specimens from six forest sites, located from the north to the south of the Chapada Diamantina region. We identified a total of 205 infrageneric taxa. In comparison with the lower montane forests, the upper montane forests presented higher diversity and species richness, as well as greater numbers of substrates colonized, life form types, species of restricted geographic distribution and species typical of shaded areas. We also found low similarity in the species composition, the populations of the upper and lower montane forests forming two large and distinct groups. Although presenting relatively high floristic homogeneity among themselves, the Chapada Diamantina areas presented little similarity with those of the Atlantic Forest. This can be explained by the differences between the two regions in terms of environmental conditions, precipitation, seasonality, elevation and continentality.

AB  - In situ chemical oxidation with permanganate has become an accepted remedial treatment for groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents. This study focuses on the immediate and short-term effects of sodium permanganate (NaMnO4) on the indigenous subsurface microbial community composition in groundwater impacted by trichloroethylene (TCE). Planktonic and biofilm microbial communities were studied using groundwater grab samples and reticulated vitreous carbon passive samplers, respectively. Microbial community composition was analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and a high-density phylogenetic microarray (PhyloChip). Significant reductions in microbial diversity and biomass were shown during NaMnO4 exposure, followed by recovery within several weeks after the oxidant concentrations decreased to < 1 mg/L. Bray-Curtis similarities and nonmetric multidimensional scaling showed that microbial community composition before and after NaMnO4 was similar, when taking into account the natural variation of the microbial communities. Also, 16S rRNA genes of two reductive dechlorinators (Desulfuromonas spp. and Sulfurospirillum spp.) and diverse taxa capable of cometabolic TCE oxidation were detected in similar quantities by PhyloChip across all monitoring wells, irrespective of NaMnO4 exposure and TCE concentrations. However, minimal biodegradation of TCE was observed in this study, based on oxidized conditions, concentration patterns of chlorinated and nonchlorinated hydrocarbons, geochemistry, and spatiotemporal distribution of TCE-degrading bacteria.

AB  - The migratory open air nesting Apis dorsata and Apis laboriosa honeybees migrate at least twice a year. DNA genotyping showed that the same swarms return to their natal nesting sites. We examined 23 nesting sites in Nepal, India and Bhutan, on which 587 colonies of A. dorsata and A. laboriosa nested. The results showed that the frequency of the periodic mass flights (PMF) performed by the colonies is a good indicator of the status of current colony performance. During the swarming period, both, A. dorsata and A. laboriosa issue several swarms. In some colonies, so many bees swarmed out, that those remaining in the maternal colonies did not cover the combs. After the rest of the brood emerged, all the bees of such colonies abscond during the swarming period. Thus, absconding appeared in results of total out swarming. The swarms do not migrate directly to the seasonal alternative nesting sites, but establish new colonies in the areas around. After environmental conditions deteriorate, all the bees with their queens abscond and migrate to alternate seasonal nesting sites. The next season, the swarms do not return to their original reproductive natal sites, but to those sites they occupied the previous season lately, where from they absconded.

AB  - Ethylene oxide is currently a dominant agent in medical device sterilization. This work intends to study the main effects and interactions of temperature, ethylene oxide concentration, and relative humidity on commercial spore strips of Bacillus subtilis, var. niger (ATCC 9372) inactivation, the most common microorganism used in controlling the efficacy of the process. Experiments were carried out using a full factorial experimental design at two levels (2(3) factorial design). Limit target exposure conditions for ethylene oxide concentration, temperature, and relative humidity were 250-1,000 mg EO/l, 40-60A degrees C, and 50-90%, respectively. Adopting a different approach from the first-order kinetics, a Gompertz model was successfully applied in data fitting of the inactivation curves. Bacillus subtilis kinetic behavior presented a sigmoidal inactivation with an initial shoulder (lambda), followed by a maximum inactivation rate (k(max)), these being model parameters. It was concluded that temperature and ethylene oxide concentration were the most significant factors and consequently, additional experiments were carried out aiming at describing the parameters' dependence on these process factors. Mathematical relations describing such dependences were successfully developed and included in the Gompertz kinetic model. The predictive ability of this integrated model was assessed, and its adequacy in predicting B. subtilis inactivation was proven.

AB  - Pippi (phosphatidyl inositol phosphate indicator) is a biosensor based on the principle of FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer), which consists of a pair of fluorescent proteins, CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and YFP (yellow fluorescent protein), the PH domain sandwiched between them, and K-Ras C-terminal sequence for plasma membrane localization. Due to marked cross-excitation of YFP with the conditions used to excite CFP, initial FRET images obtained by TPE (two-photon excitation) microscopy suffered from low signal-to-noise ratio, hampering the observation of lipids in three-dimensional structures. To solve this problem, YFP and CFP in the original Pippi-PI(3,4)P-2 was replaced by sREACh (super resonance energy accepting chromoprotein) and mTFP1 (monomeric teal fluorescent protein), respectively. The biosensor was also fused with an internal control protein, mKeima, where Keima/mTFP1 indicates the FRET efficiency, and indeed epidermal growth factor stimulation increased Keima/mTFP1 in HeLa cells. This biosensor successfully showed PI(3,4)P-2 accumulation to the lateral membrane in the MDCK cyst cultured in a three-dimensional environment. Furthermore, other FRET-based biosensors for PIP3 distribution and for tyrosine kinase activity were developed based on this method, suggesting its broad application for visualizing signal transduction events with TPE microscopy.

AB  - It is well established that regular aerobic exercise training reduces all-cause mortality and improves a number of health outcomes. However, a marked heterogeneity in the training-induced changes, e.g. in terms of aerobic fitness, has been observed in healthy human subjects, even with highly standardized training programs. Mean improvements in aerobic fitness, expressed as maximal oxygen consumption, have been about 10-15% of the baseline values, but the training-induced changes have ranged from almost none to a 40% increase. The exact nature of the mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity in response to regular aerobic exercise is not well known. In this review, we consider evidence of the association between the autonomic nervous system (ANS), aerobic fitness and aerobic training-induced changes in fitness. Results of recent studies support the hypothesis that assessment of ANS functioning includes important information concerning acute and chronic physiological processes before, during and after aerobic exercise training stimulus. Moreover, we show that daily assessment of ANS activity could serve as an indicator of appropriate physiological condition for aerobic training. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mechanistic bioaccumulation models are powerful tools in environmental risk assessment as they provide insight in varying accumulation patterns across species, contaminants, and conditions, and they are applicable beyond tested cases. In these models key parameters, as absorption and elimination rate constants, are predicted based on chemical specific properties and physiological characteristics. However, due to the complex environmental behavior of metals, the development of mechanistic bioaccumulation models has lagged behind that for organic chemicals. Absorption and elimination rate constants of organic substances have long been linked to their octanol-water partition coefficient, yet no equivalent quantitative relationships exist for metals. In the present study, we successfully related metal absorption rate constants to a metal specific property, the covalent index, and a species-characteristic, the ventilation rate. This quantitative relationship holds for a wide range of organisms and metals, i.e., 17 aquatic species and 10 metals, suggesting that a generic modeling approach of metal uptake kinetics is feasible for aquatic organisms. In contrast, elimination rate constants show no metal - specific character. Average, weight-corrected elimination rate constants are relatively similar among metals and species, suggesting that a single weight-corrected elimination rate constant can be used in bioaccumulation studies on aquatic species.

AB  - The previously reported Fung double tube (FDT)for Clostridium perfringens and the newly developed EasyPhage test for F-specific RNA coliphages were evaluated as screening tests for fecal contamination of fresh and marine recreational waters in Hawaii. These two tests were used to analyze water samples from marine swimming beaches, streams, nonswimming coastal waters and raw sewage. The major advantages of the FDT test include formation of anaerobic conditions without the need of anaerobic chamber systems and enumeration Of colonies of C. perfringens in the tubes within 6 h. The results showed that 5 mL of water sample and 20 mL of 2x Shahidi Ferguson Perfringens medium were the best combination for the enumeration of C. perfringens in 5-6 It at 42C. This is a candidate, rapid beach monitoring method which can be used to close the beach on the same day the water samples were collected. The major advantages of the EasyPhage method include the rapid formation of gel without the use of heat, and addition of streptomycin and ampicillin to control interfering bacterial contamination. These two test methods allow most water laboratories to monitor environmental waters for C. perfringens and F-specific RNA coliphages as indicators of fecal contamination.

AB  - The ability to continuously monitor chemical properties of hydrothermal vent effluents for extended periods of time is essential to understanding dynamic processes responsible for the temporally variable nature of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. Although instruments do exist for some parameters, there has been no sensor capable of measuring the chloride concentration, an indicator of possible phase separation, on a real-time and long-term basis. In this article, we discuss the construction of a novel instrument which measures solution resistance as a proxy for chloride concentration. The sensor consists of four gold electrodes embedded in a cylindrical ZrO2 ceramic housing. It has been successfully deployed in several high temperature vents at the Main Endeavour Field (MEF) on the Juan de Fuca ridge in the NE Pacific, and calibrated under simulated hydrothermal conditions ranging up to 380 degrees C and 300 bar. The in situ data clearly demonstrate a tidal influence on the effluent from some high temperature vents possibly relating to a subsurface mixing process involving non-seawater end-members. Non-tidal changes are used to constrain the sequence and type of controls operating on fluids circulating within the subsurface. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ultrafiltration (UF) and coagulation-ultrafiltration (CUF) of raw water from the Des Roches Lake were performed and compared in terms of natural organic matter (NOM) removal and in terms of membrane permeability variation. The study was carried out at a laboratory scale with a membrane having a nominal pore size of 0.035 mum. The removal of NOM by UF was significant (10% to more than 50% for UV absorbance at 254 nm and 0% to more than 30% for TOC) but was also very dependent on operating conditions. Membrane fouling occurred rapidly and was strongly accelerated as the permeate flux increased. Fouling also induced a decrease of NOM removal. Coagulation before UF brought a strong increase of NOM removal (TOC removal higher than 60% and reduction of UV absorbance at 254 nm higher than 80%). It also largely reduced membrane permeability loss even for permeation flux higher than 150 L(.)h(-1.)m(-2). In the absence of coagulation, and operating with full recirculation of the concentrate, there was a reduction of the SUVA ratio (UV254/TOC) and iron concentration in the feed water. This indicates a preferential deposit of humic substances onto the membranes and shows that iron either plays a role in membrane fouling or could be an indicator of the presence of fouling substances.

AB  - Using estimates of particulate matter (PM), PM10 and PM2.5 made from the mass size distributions measured regularly using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) impactor for the period October 1998-December 2000 at the coastal station Trivandrum, the long-term average values (for 27 months) of PM10 and PM2.5 are estimated. The season wise shares of PM10 and PM2.5 to PM are computed. Results indicate highest contribution of PM10 to PM during local summer/premonsoon while the contribution of PM2.5 to PM peaks during local winter. These shares are lowest during monsoon months. Average values of PM10 and PM2.5 were found to be around 5 0 and 43 mug m(-3) under ambient conditions. For making an environmental assessment these values are corrected for humidity changes and reduced to a constant RH level of 50%. An order of magnitude estimate is made of the sea salt contribution to the total based on recent measurements during the INDOEX. After these apportionments, it is found that even though the PM 10 concentration is well below the standards set by several national environmental agencies, the PM2.5 concentration appears to be quite critical. The findings are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infrared absorption spectra of the amorphous and phosphorus-rich ferric mineral associated with the biofilm of Monracuta ferruginosa, a marine bivalve, were obtained by applying the KBr disc method. Phosphate absorption bands due to P-O stretching vibrations were observed at 1100 and 1020 cm(-1). This result, as well as the similarity of spectra with other well known (bio)minerals. suggests that the mineral is an amorphous iron oxyhydroxide gel with phosphate sorbed on its surface rather than a pure ferric phosphate. It is suggested that phosphate ions are of microbial origin because phosphate-producing enzymes were detected in vivo. Apart from iron, the mineral phase is devoid of other heavy metals. Despite its similarity with other abiotically precipitated phases, it is argued that the mineral is the result of in situ microbial biomineralization processes in the biofilm and not the result of a simple bioaccumulation process. This is supported by microscopic observations. A geological implication is that the simple presence of such iron minerals in ancient sedimentary environments, where microbes have not been fossilized, might be considered as an indicator of microorganisms performing biomineralization. By comparison with the present-day environment of M. ferruginosa, precise paleoenvironmental conditions may be inferred. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - For paleoclimatic reconstructions based on vegetation history in Iceland, the upper limit of tree or shrub birch growth has been proposed as an indicator of summer temperature. Plant macrofossil and pollen analyses of a series of sections and cores from Vesturardalur on Trollaskagi show that Betula pubescens grew up to an altitude between 450 and 500 m a.s.l. during optimum conditions in the Holocene. The birch pollen and macrofossil record of core Vesturardalur 2 at ca. 450 m a.s.l., which covers the time from ca. 9200 BP to present, thus represents the first continuous high-resolution reconstruction of the variations of Betula pubescens at the ecological upper limit of tree or shrub birch in northern Iceland. Between ca. 6700 and ca. 6000 BP, a distinct maximum in the influx of Betula pubescens pollen at this site indicates a high position of the shrub line. This can be distinguished from a low influx of tree or shrub birch pollen from ca. 6000 to ca. 5600 BP, and a very pronounced minimum of Betula pubescens in the pollen record around ca. 3300 BP. The inferred depressions of the shrub line can be correlated with evidence for glacier advances and increased slope activity in northern Iceland.

AB  - Chironomid midges (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are sensitive indicators of environmental change, but relatively few studies have been made of the response of European midge faunas to the high amplitude climatic oscillations of the late-glacial. In this study, late-glacial assemblages of chironomid midges from four Swiss lakes, or former lakes, [Gerzensee (603 m), Leysin (1230 m), Regenmoos (1260 m) and Heremence (2300 m)] were compared and contrasted. The study focused on the response of chironomid assemblages to the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas cold interval (c. 12690-11485 cal. yr BP) and to minor cold climatic fluctuations (Gerzensee Oscillation, c.13200-12800 cal. yr BP, and Preboreal Oscillation, c. 11365-11100 cal. yr BP). The durations of these climatic fluctuations were defined climato-stratigraphically based on oxygen isotope boundaries and the chronology was derived by correlation with GRIP oxygen isotope records. Major differences in the composition of the four lakes' chironomid assemblages reflected differences in altitude and local environmental conditions. Nevertheless, each lake fauna showed a marked response to the major and minor climatic oscillations, demonstrating that large-scale temperature change had an overriding influence on the distribution of chironomid midges.

AB  - In this article we discuss the treatment of contact-impact modeling in a large deformation explicit transient dynamic setting. Such problems are posed mathematically by demanding the usual satisfaction momentum balance equations and boundary conditions for each body separately, while imposing an additional set of constraints that govern the interaction of these bodies with each other. In applying such methods to contact problems we emphasize two requirements: first, that the treatment of contact should follow from the development of the local tweak) and global (strong) forms of the contact equations in the continuum setting. Algorithms developed from this framework are seen to readily handle the three-dimensional multi-body friction case. Second, and equally important especially in large applications is the practical aspect of computing the closest point projection for contact nodes, an essential component of defining the contact constraints. This calculation is global in nature, accounting for the fact that contact-impact involves multiple bodies interacting in unforeseeable ways. These requirements have guided the development of algorithms capable of treating contact-impact in PRONTO3D (M.W. Heinstein, S.W. Attaway, J.W. Swegle, F.J. Mello, A general purpose contact detection algorithm for nonlinear structural analysis sodes, SAND92-2141, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, N-87185, 1992) are discussed in this paper.

AB  - The abundance of terrestrial pteridophytes was studied in eight sites in Western Amazonia, all representing lowland tropical rain forest in non-inundated terrain (tierra firme). In each site, a sample plot ranging from 0.25 ha to 1.00ha in area was inventoried and all terrestrial pteridophytes were recorded. In total, 27,000 individuals representing sixty-four species were encountered, with each plot having between fourteen and thirty-three species. The plots represented a gradient from nutrient-poor sandy soils to relatively fertile clay soils, and it was found that their floristic compositions clearly correlated with the differences in the soils. Two-thirds of the species were restricted either to poor, intermediate or rich soils, while less than a tenth were found growing on all soil types. Analyses of species lists from another twenty neotropical localities supported the result that some pteridophyte species associate, whereas other species are never found growing together. The floristic similarities among sites showed no relationship to the geographical distances between them, but rather reflected similarities in soils. It is concluded that pteridophytes are good indicators of such ecological conditions, and that when interpreting biogeographical patterns in the neotropical rain forests, it is important to take into account the distribution of edaphically different habitats.

AB  - Two of the largest and deepest endorheic lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, Nam Co and Tangra Yumco, were targeted to infer Late Quaternary (24 ka) responses of their hydrological balance to environmental dynamics. For this purpose, high-resolution multi-proxy records were used to obtain information on lake level variations and how these are related to direct precipitation proxies. Allochthonous minerogenic input as reflected by potassium (K), is directly linked to precipitation driven by variations in Indian Summer Monsoon. Negatively correlated elements such as Ca, Sr and Mg and associated carbonate mineral phases represent autochthonous sediment production, which is coupled to evaporation in these closed systems. delta C-13 and delta O-18 of bulk carbonates represent lake water conditions, i.e., salinity and lake water volume, interpreted as precipitation-evaporation (P/E) balance. In combination with geomorphological features, i.e., lake level terraces and paleo-shorelines, the multy-proxy data set from Nam Co is used to reconstruct lake level dynamics. Low lake levels of >90 m below the recent one between 20 and 16 ka cal BP are associated with most enriched delta 18Ocarb values and the precipitation of aragonite and high-Mg calcite in a shallow lake with highly dynamic allochthonous minerogenic input. Similar conditions are observed between 13.1 and 11.4 ka cal BP matching the Younger Dryas chronozone. Between 15.5 and 13.1 ka cal BP as well as during the Early Holocene (11.4 to 8.0 ka cal BP) distinctly depleted delta O-18(carb) and delta C-13(carb) coupled with high rates of allochthonous minerogenic input suggest substantial strengthening in precipitation. After 9.4 ka cal BP, the terrigenous input and thus precipitation is significantly reduced, whereas delta O-18(carb) reveals only a slight enrichment trend and thus a slowly but steady decrease in lake level througout the Mid-to Late Holocene. The decoupling of this relation between precipitation and lake level suggest that lake level terraces of large endorheic lakes on the TP and also delta O-18(carb) records are not a direct indicator of (monsoonal) precipitiation, whereas the allochtonous minerogenic input can be directly linked to precipitation dynamics. This is supported by the comparison to regional archives from the Arabian Sea and the northern Bay of Bengal, showing the very same pattern in precipitation variability. The presented monsoon precipitation record from Nam Co additionally reveals a link to supra-regional atmospheric circulation components as it is oscillating in-and anti-phase to ElNino strength and frequency. A distinct precipitation change at 2 ka cal BP seems to have affected all archives, however leaving space for future studies to find the cause of this Late-Holocene climatic shift.

AB  - IMPORTANCE In health care systems in which hospital reimbursement is based on a national mean length of stay (LOS), disadvantaged patients with an increased LOSmay be a source of inefficiency. This implication has been reported in adult patients, but pediatric data have been scarce.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association of patient socioeconomic status with hospital efficiency and financial balance in pediatrics.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study obtained data from the French national hospital discharge database covering a 3-year period, from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2014. Statistical analyses were performed between June 2016 and December 2018. All inpatient stays in hospital pediatric wards in mainland France by children older than 28 days or younger than 18 years (n = 4 121 187) were included. Admissions with coding errors or missing values for social disadvantage and/or cost calculations were excluded. EXPOSURE Social disadvantage was estimated with an ecological indicator, the FDep, available at the patient's postcode of residence and divided into national quintiles.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Efficiency was assessed through the variations in patient LOS compared with different national mean LOS (for pediatric patients, pediatric patients with a similar condition, and pediatric patients with a similar condition and severity level). Hospital financial balance was assessed at the admission level through the ratio of production costs to revenues and at the hospital level through the difference between aggregated revenues and production costs. Multivariate regression models examined the association between these indicators and socioeconomic status.
   RESULTS A total of 4 121 187 admissions were included (2 336 540 [56.7%] male; mean [SD] age, 7.4 [5.8] years). In all, 1 561 219 patients (37.9%) were in the 2 most disadvantaged quintiles. Patient LOS was shorter than the national mean LOS (mean [SD], 1.73 [4.21] days) for patients in the least disadvantaged quintile and longer for those in the more disadvantaged quintile (mean [SD], 1.67 [4.33] days vs 1.82 [4.14] days). This difference was higher for diagnosis related groups that included both adult and pediatric patients (mean [SD], 1.46 [4.22] days vs 1.61 [4.13] days) compared with those dedicated to pediatric patients (2.22 [4.13] days vs 2.12 [4.53] days). Patients in the most disadvantaged quintile were associated with a 3.2% increase in LOS (odds ratio, 1.0322; 95% CI, 1.0302-1.0341) compared with the national mean LOS. Social disadvantage was also associated with a significant increase in financial deficit for hospitals with 20% to 60% of patients in the 2 most disadvantaged quintiles (estimate: -(sic)146 389; 95% CI, -(sic)279 566 to -(sic)13 213).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patient socioeconomic status appears to be statistically significantly associated with an increase in LOS and cost in French hospitals with pediatric departments. This finding suggests that initiating reform in hospital payment methods may improve resource allocation efficiency and equity in access to pediatric care.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals, steroids, personal care products, and disruptive endocrine substances are increasingly being used for healthcare objectives and to improve living conditions, resulting in the widespread presence of micropollutants in various water sources. Traditional water/sewage and wastewater treatment plants are limited in their ability to cope with with these pollutants, making it challenging to supply safe and clean water for drinking and other domestic purposes. In this review, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CNTs related composites/ membranes have been considered suitable for settling this emerging issue. The existence of emerging micropollutants and their deleterious effects on human and animal health are discussed in this review. The efficient removal of micropollutants from different water sources using different types of CNTs (pristine/ functionalized) and CNTs-based composites/ membranes have been reviewed and evaluated. Moreover, fabrication approaches CNTs- based composites/membranes are also presented with their merits and demerits. Lastly, the current barriers and future perspectives are discussed in detail. The present review provides an in-depth understanding of the removal of micropollutants from CNTs and CNTs related composites/ membrane and allows future researchers to resolve the barriers related to their applications at an industrial scale.

AB  - This study analyzes the relationship between cost and sustainability indicators in milk farms. The data used came from 20 dairy farms located in the Zona da Mata region, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The farm information was collected through a questionnaire. The analysis period was from May 2018 to April 2019. The farms were evaluated using technical, economic, social and environmental indicators. The indicators were analyzed by descriptive and Pearson correlation analyzes. The total unit cost of milk (IE_5; r = 0.46) and the spent concentrated milk production for raw milk income (IE_4; r = 0.72) have positive correlations with the nitrogen balance (IA_3). The total unit cost of milk directly influences the farm's profit by area (IE_11; r = -0.49). Profit by area (IE_11) is associated with training and professional development (IS_21) for farmers and employees. The result of this research points out that cost management improves the economic, technical, social and environmental indicators, with increased capacity and training of the team. Environmentally, cost management can reduce the nitrogen balance, by optimizing the use of nutrients on the farm. The cost management of the dairy farm is an essential condition for the activity to be sustainable.

AB  - In this paper, the energy diagnostic of tractor performance consists in evaluating the energy (fuel consumption per hectare-dm(3) ha(-1)) for a given agricultural operation and in combining it with working capacity, also called productivity (area productivity-ha h(-1)). One of the methods of solving this problem is the identification of the functioning process of the machine unit. A model of the process of the machine unit performance was developed, considering the operation of the rear linkage system of the implement with the force control adjustment system. In order to analyze the system, a mathematical model of the system function was built: tractor-implement-soil, defining the physical connections and interdependencies between the individual subsystems of the system. Based on this model, a simulation model was developed and implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The Simulink package was used to test the performance of the machine set. The efficiency indicators according to the adopted criteria were calculated in the evaluation block. To evaluate the process, the technical and operational parameters of the tractor, the type and parameters of the tool, and soil properties were taken into account. The results of simulation studies obtained on a validated model are consistent with experimental data from appropriate soil conditions.

AB  - The value of waste heat had led to an extensive study on Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) system in recent decades, but the following three research gaps still need to be tackled to achieve a better economic and environmental performance. Firstly, the complete discreteness of equipment capabilities had not been considered. It means that multiple units with different capacities cannot be selected for a type of equipment. Then, the ambiguity and subjectivity existing in decision-makers/stakeholders' judgments on the importance of objectives are usually ignored. Finally, an easily understood and comprehensive environmental indicator based on life cycle perspective for system optimization had not been established. Thus, the aim of this study is to establish a mathematical framework to help the stakeholders select the optimal configurations, capacities, and operation conditions of CCHP system while narrowing the above three research gaps to avoid the sub-optimal solutions. Subsequently, a hypothetical case was used to verify the validity of the proposed model, along with analysis of system performance. The results indicate that the CCHP system is superior to the conventional systems, and the proposed mathematical model in this paper can improve the performance of CCHP system in terms of economy, environment, and energy.

AB  - The colonias along the United States-Mexico border are generally self-built neighborhoods of low-income families that lack basic infrastructure. While some government assistance has provided roads and electricity, water and wastewater services are still lacking in many colonias. This research is the first to collect a comprehensive dataset on water, sanitation, health, and living conditions in these unincorporated neighborhoods through collection of water samples and surveys; 114 households in 23 colonias across three geographically diverse Texas counties are studied. Water quality is assessed via traditional microbial indicators, chlorine, and arsenic. This complex dataset requires an advanced statistical tool to disentangle relationships among diverse factors. Structural equation modeling is utilized to identify relationships among surveyed and measured variables. The model reveals that colonias residents with well/hauled water accurately predict their water quality, while those with treated+piped water tend to think that their water is worse than it actually is. Dwelling quality and connection to sanitary sewers influence perceived health risks and household health, respectively. Furthermore, these communities have an overwhelming need and desire for point-of-use water treatment. This model can inform decision making and may be adapted to probe other questions and social dynamics for water and sanitation in unincorporated communities elsewhere.

AB  - Burbot (Lota lota) are a freshwater fish that exhibits a circumpolar distribution and is considered an indicator species for climate change. Adult burbot were artificially fertilized from the Sturgeon River, Michigan and eggs were incubated until hatch. For 10 weeks following hatch larvae were photographed, along with comparable samples from the Kootenai River, Idaho. Geometric morphology was used to quantify significant morphological differences between groups (n = 510). During the yolk sac stages, body shape near yolk sacs varied, likely linked to absorption differences. In preflexion and flexion stages, variable body shape in the mid-body region coincided to head and tail positions. Mean linear morphological measurement (n = 919) showed significant differences, indicating variability of size at stage between groups. Sturgeon River preflexion larvae growth patterns were variable and exhibited allometric growth in comparison to Kootenai River larvae. This suggests that development of critical structures occurs at different rates allowing for flexibility in habitat settlement or environmental conditions. Both groups showed isometric growth patterns in the flexion stage, indicating that critical structures have developed, marking an important ontogenetic shift. Variability in larval burbot hatching, morphology, and developmental rates is important to their persistence throughout North America.

AB  - Over 2,000 km of sea coasts with different environmental conditions may provide Egypt with alternative energy solutions that may be used for electricity production and water desalination, required for the vast urban expansion, mainly along the coastal areas to relieve population pressure from the old valley and delta, and to create new community opportunities in new regions. The proposed platform discussed in this paper is a mobile platform in order to supply any costal city with fresh water to prevent any water crisis. The aim of this research paper is to make an economic comparison between floating stations and fixed stations on the ground and to determine the extent of the preference of one over the other to take the appropriate investment decision that can benefit the vast Egyptian coasts. The results of the study showed the possibility of recovering the invested capital during a period of 5 years and 5 months for the floating platform and 5 years and 8 months for the fixed ground station. Economic indicators have also been used to conduct comparison such as net present value of cash flows, cost-to-return standard, internal rate of return, sensitivity analysis ([10% cost increase] [10% decrease in revenue] [both together]). All results were positive in favor of the floating platform of the desalination plant.

AB  - Change in hot extremes is one of the accepted evidence and also a global indicator of an anthropogenic climate change, which has serious environmental and economic impacts. In the present study, the India Meteorological Department gridded temperature data is used to characterize hot extremes over India in terms of frequency and intensity. Results provide compelling evidence that large parts of India, except the Indo-Gangetic plains, have experienced more occurrences of hot days (upsurge by 24.7%) having higher temperatures in the recent period (1976-2018), compared to the past (1951-1975), which suggests a shift in climate. Strong positive geopotential height anomalies at 500 hPa over the northern parts of India, which dynamically produces subsidence and clear sky conditions along with reduced precipitable water and depleted soil moisture are identified to be the crucial factors responsible for an increase of hot extremes in recent decades. Furthermore, the preceding December-February Nino-3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are strongly connected with hot days frequency and the mechanism for the lag of several months is related to 3-4 months delayed response of Indian Ocean SSTs to El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Thus, post-Nino hot extremes over India can be potentially anticipated in advance and this will help society to prepare for such extremes.

AB  - Ground vibration recorded using geophones can provide information on debris flows. This information can be used for debris flow detection and warning. However, real debris flow signals change not only from site to site but also during different times at the same location. Thus, a constant threshold calibrated with historic data at one location may not accurately detect debris flow at the same location, let alone at other locations. Therefore, a debris flow detection method requires a criterion that can transform current environmental conditions into a detection criterion. The characteristic of a debris flow tremor was discussed and transformed into two mathematical indices. We used accumulation energy and the rate of energy change in a specific spectrum domain as the representative indicators. To distinguish debris flows from noise, we assumed debris flow energy to be at least an order of magnitude larger than noise before debris flow arrival. To avoid a short-term spike event confusing the detection of debris flow, accumulation energy at an interval longer than 2 s was used. This method was tested on three debris flow events with complete records at the Ai-Yu-Zi Creek, Taiwan. The detection of arrival time for debris flows using geophone data had a delay of less than 10 s compared with the detection of arrival time through video recording.

AB  - Using herbicides results in environmental impacts and it is necessary employing sustainable technologies to reduce its residues in the soil. Imazapic, used in the sugarcane cultivation, shows persistence and mobility in the environment. This study aimed to identify plant species tolerant to imazapic with the potential for phytoremediation of soils with residues of this herbicide. The tests were conducted under greenhouse conditions involving the species Urochloa decumbens, Urochloa brizantha, Urochloa ruziziensis, Mucuna pruriens, Panicum maximum, Sorghum bicolor, Crotalaria ochroleuca, Crotalaria spectabilis and Canavalia ensiformis grown in two soils: one of sandy clay loam texture and the other of sandy clay texture. In each test, five imazapic doses (0.00, 58.33, 87.50, 175.00 and 350.00 g ha-1) were applied in pre-emergence. In all tests, the treatments were in randomized blocks with four replicates each. The soil of sandy clay loam texture with low organic carbon content decreased the tolerance of the evaluated species to imazapic due to its higher bioavailability. The species Canavalia ensiformis, Mucuna pruriens and Urochloa brizantha demonstrated lower phytotoxicity and higher dry matter production in the presence of the highest imazapic doses in the soil. The tolerance from these species can be considered as an indicator of their phytoremediation potential of soils contaminated with imazapic.

AB  - Current predictions about the responses of species to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on their distributions. In this study, we investigated the effects of future climate change scenarios on the potential distribution of 10 species of scorpions in north-eastern Brazil in the context of their degree of specialisation to closed (Atlantic and Amazon Forests) and open (Caatinga and Cerrado) habitats. Scorpion species were classified as habitat specialists or generalists according to the IndVal index, and present and future species distribution models were prepared using minimum volume ellipsoids. According to IndVal, four species were classified as closed-forest specialists (Ananteris mauryi, Tityus brazilae, Tityus pusillus and Tityus neglectus), four as open-forest specialists (Jaguajir agamemnon, Jaguajir rochae, Physoctonus debilis and Bothriurus rochai), and two as generalists (Tityus stigmurus and Bothriurus asper). All species presented a drastic reduction in potential distribution, ranging from 44% to 72%, when compared with their current distribution. In addition, we found a reduction in scorpion species richness under future climate change scenarios. This finding has implications for scorpion conservation. Further, the results show that climate change may impact the composition of scorpion assemblages in north-eastern Brazil, revealing important implications for human-scorpion interactions.

AB  - Phytoplankton play a key role as the base of the marine food web and a crucial component in the Earth's carbon cycle. There have been a few regional studies that have utilized satellite-estimated phytoplankton functional type products in conjunction with other environmental metrics. Here we expand to a global perspective and ask, what are the physical drivers of phytoplankton composition variability? Using a variety of satellite-observed ocean color products and physical properties spanning 1997-2015, we characterize spatial and temporal variability in phytoplankton community size structure in relation to satellite-based physical drivers. We consider the relationships globally and by major thermal regimes (cold and warm), dominant size distribution, and chlorophyll concentration variability. Globally, euphotic depth is the most important parameter driving phytoplankton size variability and also over the majority of the high-latitude ocean and the central gyres. In all other regions, size variability is driven by a balance of light and mode of nutrient delivery. We investigated the relationship between size composition and chlorophyll concentration and the physical drivers through correlation analysis. Changes in size composition over time are regionally varying and explained by temporal shifts in the varying physical conditions. These changes in phytoplankton size composition and the varying underlying physical drivers will ultimately impact carbon export and food web processes in our changing ocean.

AB  - Storage technologies are progressively emerging as a key measure to accommodate high shares of intermittent renewables with a view to guarantee their effective integration towards a profound decarbonisation of existing energy systems. This study aims to evaluate to what extent electricity storage can contribute to a significant renewable penetration by absorbing otherwise-curtailed renewable surplus and quantitatively defines the associated costs. Under a Smart Energy System perspective, a variety of future scenarios are defined for the Italian case based on a progressively increasing renewable and storage capacity feeding an ever-larger electrified demand mostly made up of electric vehicles and, to some extent, heat pumps and power-to-gas/liquid technologies. Results are compared in terms of crucial environmental and techno-economic indicators and discussed with respect to storage operating parameters. The outcome of this analysis reveals the remarkable role of electricity storage in increasing system flexibility and reducing, in the range 24-44%, the renewable capacity required to meet a given sustainability target. Nonetheless, such achievements become feasible only under relatively low investment and operating costs, condition that excludes electrochemical storage solutions and privileges low-cost alternatives that at present, however, exist only at a pilot or demonstration scale.

AB  - By applying an integrated framework, we developed a new way to quantify the multifunctionality of rural residential land: analyzing the reciprocal relationships between the structure and function of land use, as well as identifying the demand of rural sustainability for residential land functions. In the assessment of the rural residential land functions from the supply and demand perspectives by establishing an indicators system, the results show that there are five substantial functions of rural residential land, i.e., residential, public service, industrial, commercial and ecological function, and a potential function. Unbalanced development patterns between function supply and demand are clearly observed at multilevel: at the regional level, demand exceeding supply refers to the public service, commercial, and ecological function, especially for ecological function; at the town level, the spatial pattern of the difference is closely linked with topographic features; the inferior and complex topographic condition always is associated with inadequate function supply. Strategies based on the arrangements of rural residential land use structure, including function conversion and function enhancement, have been adopted to balance the supply and demand of land functions. Together, alternative strategies (e.g., industrial allocation, population introduction, and location choices) also need to be recognized by policymakers to achieve rural sustainable development.

AB  - Globally, droughts are a recurring major natural disaster owing to below normal precipitation, and are occasionally associated with high temperatures, which together negatively impact upon human health and social, economic, and cultural activities. Drought early warning and monitoring is thus essential for reducing such potential impacts on society. To this end, several experimental methods have previously been proposed for calculating drought, yet these are based almost entirely on precipitation alone. Here, for the first time, and in contrast to previous studies, we use seven climate parameters to establish drought/wet periods; these include: T-min, T-max, sunshine hours, relative humidity, average rainfall, number of rain days greater than 1 mm, and the ratio of total precipitation to number of days with precipitation, using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) algorithm. To test the TOPSIS method for different climate zones, six sample stations representing a variety of different climate conditions were used by assigning weight changes to climate parameters, which are then applied to the model, together with multivariate regression analysis. For the six stations tested, model results indicate the lowest errors for Zabol station and maximum errors for Kermanshah. The validation techniques strongly support our proposed new method for calculating and rating drought/wet events using TOPSIS.

AB  - Intelligent food packaging can provide consumers with reliable and correct information on the quality and safety of packaged foods. One of the key constituents in intelligent packaging is a colorimetric oxygen indicator, which is widely used to detect oxygen gas involved in food spoilage by means of a color change. Traditional oxygen indicators consisting of redox dyes and strong reducing agents have two major problems: they must be manufactured and stored under anaerobic conditions because air depletes the reductant, and their components are synthetic and toxic. To address both of these serious problems, we have developed a natural component-based oxygen indicator characterized by in-pack activation. The conventional oxygen indicator composed of synthetic and artificial components was redesigned using naturally occurring compounds (laccase, guaiacol, and cysteine). These natural components were physically separated into two compaiiments by a fragile barrier. Only when the barrier was broken were all of the components mixed and the function as an oxygen indicator was begun (i.e., in-pack activation). Depending on the component concentrations, the natural component-based oxygen indicator exhibited different response times and color differences. The rate of the color change was proportional to the oxygen concentration. This novel colorimetric oxygen indicator will contribute greatly to intelligent packaging for healthier and safer foods.

AB  - Introduction: Biomarkers are characteristics measured as indicators of normal biological processes. Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are associated with neurological symptoms. In this setting, unique disease or process specific biomarkers show promise to identify symptomatic and presymptomatic disease and/or provide surrogate end-points to demonstrate clinical efficacy of new treatments, such as neuroprotective agents.Areas covered: Neuroimaging can interrogate brain structure, biochemistry and networks noninvasively. Because the pathophysiologic process underlying cognitive and neurological decline in a number of IEMs involves progressive neurodegeneration of selective brain regions, repeatable, noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging measures of brain anatomy, chemistry, physiology, and pathology are promising as a class of potential biomarkers. Multimodal neuroimaging allows complementary information, each of which addresses a different aspect of pathology, function or biochemistry. It is critical to understand their uses and limitations. We discuss the utility of biomarkers in the context of our work in urea cycle disorders.Expert commentary: Because of the frequency of hyperammonemic injury in this condition, noninvasive measures to assess neurological function must be developed. Neuroimaging continues to gain credibility as a primary outcome for clinical trials and the technology continues to advance. Methods for standardization across sites will enable more efficient study of rare disorders.

AB  - This study investigates the role of coliforms in the carriage of class 1 integron and biocide resistance genes in a drinking water treatment plant and explores the relationship between the carriage of such genes and the biofouling abilities of the strain. The high incidence of class 1 integron and biocide resistance genes (33.3 % of the isolates) highlights the inherent risk of genetic contamination posed by coliform populations during drinking water treatment. The association between the presence of intI1 gene and qac gene cassettes, especially qacH, was greater in biofilm cells. In coliforms recovered from biofilms, a higher frequency of class 1 integron elements and higher diversity of genetic patterns occurred, compared to planktonic cells. The coliform isolates under the study proved to mostly carry non-classical class 1 integrons lacking the typical qacE Delta 1/sul1 genes or a complete tni module, but bearing the qacH gene. No link was found between the carriage of integron genes and the biofouling degree of the strain, neither in aerobic or in anaerobic conditions. Coliform bacteria isolated from established biofilms rather adhere in oxygen depleted environments, while the colonization ability of planktonic cells is not significantly affected by oxygen availability.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Self-reported bodily symptoms are of primary importance in healthcare and in health-related research. Typically, they are assessed in clinical interviews or by means of traditional questionnaire formats that require the respondent to provide retrospective symptom estimates rated along intuitive frequency and/or intensity standards and aggregated across varying or unspecified time windows.
   Recent findings
   Retrospective symptom assessments are often biased when compared to (averaged) momentary assessments of symptoms. A variety of factors and conditions have been identified to influence the amount of bias in symptom reporting. Recent research has focused on the underlying mechanisms for the discrepancy between memory and experience. It is suggested that different types of questions and formats assess different types of information, and each may be relevant for different purposes. Knowledge of these underlying mechanisms also provides a relevant framework to better understand individual differences in symptom reporting, including somatoform and somatic symptom disorder.
   Summary
   Accuracy of self-reported bodily symptoms is important for the clinician and the researcher. Understanding the mechanisms underlying bias may provide an interesting window to understand how symptom episodes are processed, encoded, and consolidated in memory and may also provide clues to modify symptom experiences.

AB  - Interest in measuring well-being, as opposed to the more traditional economic indicators of growth, has increased significantly over recent years. This paper aims to contribute to the empirical literature on well-being indicators and dispersion across regions in terms of both quality of life and economic progress. Italian regions are used as case studies and 10 different multidimensional determinants of well-being are considered: culture and free time; education; employment; environment; availability of essential public services; health; material living conditions; personal security; research and innovation; and the strength of social relations. We calculated, by applying principal component analysis, synthetic indicators for each well-being determinant and for each region so as to generate-again, by means of the same methodology-an index of overall well-being. The study was conducted for every year over the period 2004-2010. Results clearly show that differences in well-being between regions are not necessarily in line with those based on per capita GDP, suggesting a need to give more attention to quality-of-life features of economic progress in public policy goals and design. Furthermore, the paper looked at dispersion across regions and regional rank mobility over the same period. Italian regions have tended to become more similar in terms of well-being over time, but no evidence of significant intra-distributional mobility emerges.

AB  - Sixteen existing multi-family buildings (94 apartments) in Finland and 20 (96 apartments) in Lithuania were investigated prior to their renovation in order to develop and test out a common protocol for the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) assessment, and to assess the potential for improving IEQ along with energy efficiency. Baseline data on buildings, as well as data on temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), radon, and microbial content in settled dust were collected from each apartment. In addition, questionnaire data regarding housing quality and health were collected from the occupants. The results indicated that most measured IEQ parameters were within recommended limits. However, different baselines in each country were observed especially for parameters related to thermal conditions and ventilation. Different baselines were also observed for the respondents' satisfaction with their residence and indoor air quality, as well as their behavior related to indoor environment. In this paper, we present some evidence for the potential in improving IEQ along with energy efficiency in the current building stock, followed by discussion of possible IEQ indicators and development of the assessment protocol.

AB  - Geo-located information is increasingly important for regional decision making and spatial assessment. Toronto has witnessed rapid demographic and economic change over the last decades, making the Toronto region the fourth largest economic centre in North America. From a policymaker's perspective, understanding land use for planning purposes is critical for better urban planning. Such information is, however, conditioned by classical surveying and sophisticated remote sensing techniques, which are often costly and spatially not feasible. Only local knowledge and information can really bridge this gap, as urban land use in denser urban regions is often very fine-grained information. Volunteered geo-information (VGI) sources are fundamental tools for the assessment of urban land use patterns. This article identifies land use patterns using VGI and offers a comparative assessment with traditionally classified land use features from remote sensing imagery for Toronto. A parcel-based analysis of the voluntarily shared spatial information is used and extended at a regional level, with an overall accuracy of 75 percent. Additionally, a per-class analysis confirms which land classes can be well (or poorly) mapped, and what level of disagreement exists between our approach and official records. The findings confirm a promising outlook for harnessing VGI for urban land use mapping for Toronto.

AB  - Levetiracetam (LT) is an FDA-approved orally active anticonvulsant drug. A high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method for the analysis of LT in a tablet formulation has been developed and validated. Separation is performed on silica gel 60 F-254 with toluene-ethyl acetate-methanol, 2:1:1 (v/v/v) as mobile phase. Densitometric evaluation of the separated zone is carried out at 204 nm. There is no chromatographic interference from the tablet excipients, and compact spots are observed for LT (R-F = 0.50 +/- 0.02). Regressional analysis of the calibration plot revealed good linearity over the concentration range of 0.1-1.0 mu g/mL. The method is validated for linearity, precision, robustness, and recovery in accordance with ICH guidelines. The LOD and LOQ were found to be 0.03 and 0.1 mu g/spot, respectively. Stability was checked under acidic, alkaline, and aquatic environmental stress conditions. The drug was found to be more than 65% undegraded after 14 days of study. The developed method might be useful in the quality control of LT in the pharmaceutical industry and environmental toxicity assessments.

AB  - Cynara cardunculus can be grown as high biomass crop for energy or biofuel. Marginal land rather than farmland should be used for such crops. Here we evaluated the tolerance of Cynara plants to Cd and As using controlled-environment conditions and hydroponic culture. The aim was to ascertain whether this species could be potentially useful for phytoremediation of marginal soils with excess Cd or As burdens. Plants were exposed to 5 mu M Cd or to 5 or 10 mu M As in the form of arsenate or arsenite. Root elongation, malonyldialdehyde production and total concentrations of total acid soluble thiols were used as indicators of stress response. Biomass production and root and shoot accumulation of Cd and As were determined. The plants exhibited considerable tolerance to Cd and As. Biomass was hardly affected by the potentially toxic concentrations of Cd and As. Cadmium was preferentially accumulated in old leaves. Contrastingly, As was efficiently retained in the roots. Results indicate that C. cardunculus can be a useful species for phytoextraction of Cd from polluted soils. On soils rich in arsenic, cardoon could be grown as an energy crop that can help to stabilize these soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate (eO)(R), a biological time temperature integrator (TTI) as a quality and safety indicator for ground beef packed under modified atmosphere and spiced cooked chicken slices packed under modified atmosphere. Storage trials and challenge tests were thus performed on several batches of the studied food to monitor and model the behavior of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and the indigenous food flora. Then, two different prototypes of the TTI (eO)(R) were set and manufactured according to the studied products shelf lives. The TTI evolution with time at static and dynamic temperatures was monitored and modeled. Finally, exposure assessment models were set and used under several realistic storage profiles to assess the distributions of the concentration of the indigenous food flora and the distributions of the increase in the pathogens populations obtained at the end of the product shelf life or at the end point of the TTI, taking into account the TTIs batch variability. Results showed that in case of poor storage conditions, TTI can reduce the consumer exposure to altered or hazardous foods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Whereas exogenously acquired proteins are the major source of antigens feeding the MHC class II pathway in antigen-presenting cells, some endogenously expressed antigens also access that pathway but the rules governing such access are poorly understood. Here we address this using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-coded nuclear antigen EBNA1, a protein naturally expressed in EBV-infected B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and a source of multiple CD4(+) T cell epitopes. Using CD4(+) T cell clones against three indicator epitopes, we find that two epitopes are weakly displayed on the LCL surface whereas the third is undetectable, a pattern of limited epitope presentation that is maintained even when nuclear expression of EBNA1 is induced to high supraphysiological levels. Inhibitor and siRNA studies show that, of the two epitopes weakly presented under these conditions, one involves macroautophagy, and the second involves antigen delivery to the MHC II pathway by another endogenous route. In contrast, when EBNA1 is expressed as a cytoplasmic protein, all three CD4 epitopes are processed and presented much more efficiently, and all involve macroautophagy. We conclude that EBNA1's nuclear location limits its accessibility to the macroautophagy pathway and, in consequence, limits the level and range of EBNA1 CD4 epitopes naturally displayed on the infected cell surface.

AB  - In this study, we examined the hypothesis that the microbial communities in mangrove sediments with different chemical and historical characteristics respond differently to the disturbance of a hydrocarbon spill. Two different mangrove sediments were sampled, one close to an oil refinery that had suffered a recent oil spill and another that had not been in contact with oil. Based on the sampled sediment, two sets of mesocosms were built, and oil was added to one of them. They were subjected to mimicked mangrove conditions and monitored for 75 days. Archaeal and bacterial communities were evaluated through PCR-DGGE. Both communities showed the emergence of small numbers of novel bands in response to oil pollution. 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from both mesocosms before the addition of oil and at day 75 after oil addition. LIBSHUFF analysis showed that both mangrove-based mesocosms contained similar communities at the start of the experiment and that they were different from the initial one, as well as from each other, after 75 days. These results hint at a role of environmental history that is not obvious from community diversity indicators, but is apparent from the response to the applied stress.

AB  - Diel and tidal variations of fish assemblages were assessed at Pontal beach, southern Brazil, using a seine net. Species richness was greater at night, whereas fish number, weight, and richness (community indicators) were all influenced by the tidal state. Samples from rising tides were more representative, probably due to onshore fish movements for feeding purposes. However, lower catches were associated with high tides, mainly through net avoidance, indicating that sampling in these conditions is not highly informative. Clupeoids exhibited greater variation in a 24 h period, and the night occurrence of A. tricolor and daylight shoaling of Harengula clupeola, Anchoa parva and Sardinella brasiliensis suggested distinct strategies for avoiding daylight predators. In some species, this behaviour may have been induced by the bottom morphology and tidal state, facilitating nearshore grouping. In addition to being caught at night, the occurrences of Menticirrhus littoralis, Pomadasys corvinaeformis, Umbrina coroides and Hyporhamphus unifasciatus indicated a spatial niche partition according to tidal state. Although not evaluated properly, temporal fluctuations could reflect species recruitment patterns. Seasonal fluctuations have to be considered when analysing short-term changes in the community as such fluctuations are synchronized with the natural history of the species, making it difficult to interpret short-term variations in isolation.

AB  - Many industrial processes and sewage treatment facilities produce odours, most of which are of decomposed sulphur compounds. Hydrogen sulphide, which is a toxic and corrosive gas, may be the standard indicator among the obnoxious odours and therefore the amount released into the air is required to be regulated strictly. Hydrogen sulphide was efficiently removed from contaminated air by a pilot-scale biofilter: a column prepared with soil, sawdust and activated sludge materials from the leather industry was used for preparation of a biodegradation unit. The biodegradation unit was used under several working conditions which were designed for 48 h repetition intervals, with different hydrogen sulphide concentrations, loading rate increased from 10 to 100 mg m(-3) and different gas flow rates (25, 50 and 75 m s(-1)). The removal efficiencies of the biodegradation unit were measured mainly from the outflow concentrations and degradation activity. The main by-product obtained in the biodegradation process was sulphate in the drainage water. as it accounted for more than 90% of the total sulphur compound decomposed in the packing material. Sulphate removal from the system was carried out by drainage water during the operation periods. In the recent study, about 100% hydrogen sulphide removal was found at lower gas flow rates by the biologically produced reactor.

AB  - We tested the efficacy of two biodiversity indices, average taxonomic distinctness and variation in average taxonomic distinctness, for indicating environmental stress in seaweed assemblages from the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada. These indices, which measure the average number of taxonomic levels between species in a sample, offer a potential panacea for biomonitoring because their calculation requires only a species list and a regional taxonomic hierarchy, they offer a statistical framework for testing whether assemblages deviate from an expected taxonomic breadth, and previous studies involving animal assemblages have demonstrated an independence from sampling effort. However, our results were not consistent with previously published studies or with our perception of site conditions. Specifically, putatively impacted sites scored above-average taxonomic distinctness values, while sites otherwise regarded as healthy were indicated as environmentally degraded. We also demonstrate that average taxonomic distinctness values can be negatively correlated with species richness, Shannon diversity and with functional diversity. Further, increasing the breadth of the regional species list to which specific sites were compared resulted in a more conservative test of impact. We recommend that a qualitative understanding of how specific biotic assemblages respond to stress is a necessary prerequisite to use the taxonomic distinctness indices for environmental stress assessments.

AB  - Pastures constitute an important terrestrial ecosystem. In France, pastures occupy 21% of the total area. A big effort is being made to develop a real-time systematic approach to estimate biomass production at a national level, focusing on spatial and seasonal variability in relation to drought. The absence of indirect low-cost methods that could be applied to large areas contributes to this situation. Advances in remote sensing and crop models offer new methodological and operative possibilities to solve this problem. In this paper, 13 forage regions (FR) in France were selected on the basis of their different geomorphologic, climatic and soil conditions with regard to pastoral production. Images from Systeme Probatoire de l'Observation de la. Terre (SPOT) 4-VEGETATION were used to forecast productive variables estimated by the STICS-Prairie simulation model. In general terms, both satellite and productive data agreed properly. Particularly, the relationship between the middle infrared based vegetation index (SWVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) demonstrated the best results whatever the FR. Results obtained confirm the capabilities of remote sensing data as an accurate predictor of productive variables estimated as from simulation models. Differences between satellite information and model estimations of pasture systems, especially during the harvesting periods, could be good indicators to improve model estimations at a regional scale as well.

AB  - Although the association of lipophilic drugs with plasma lipoproteins has not been fully characterized, there are several reports of lipoprotein association being influential in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of important therapeutic agents. The current studies utilized a series of aliphatic esters of halofantrine to evaluate the role of several physicochemical properties on the interaction of the different compounds with plasma lipoproteins. Density gradient ultracentrifugation techniques were employed to determine drug association in triglyceride rich (TRL), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), under both fasted and post-prandial conditions. Compound solubility in medium or long chain triglycerides was a useful indicator of the extent of drug-lipoprotein association, particularly for the triglyceride rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins). This is likely a function of the compounds being solubilized within the apolar (triglyceride and cholesterol ester) lipid core. However, molecular size also played an important role in determining lipoprotein distribution, particularly for association with the more protein abundant lipoproteins, such as HDL. Lipoprotein association of Hf analogues containing longer unsaturated esters was best correlated with total lipoprotein surface area rather than with lipoprotein core lipid volumes.

AB  - Analyses are made of the evolution of selected polarimetric radar data fields during periods immediately preceding the onset of near-surface hail indicators [high reflectivity and low differential reflectivity (Z(dr))] in two nonsupercellular northeastern Colorado hailstorms. The primary data were obtained from the 11-cm-wavelength, dual-polarization Colorado State University (CSU)-University of Chicago and Illinois State Water Survey radar. In one of the storms, dual-Doppler wind field syntheses were available using additional velocity data collected by the CSU Pawnee S-band radar. In both events, linear depolarization ratio (LDR) values exceeding 225 dB began to appear in the right flank of the 50-dBZ echo core region, within the 0 degrees to -20 degreesC environmental temperature range, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of hail at the surface. Scattering calculations suggest that the LDR enhancement may have been caused by an increasing water fraction within the growing hailstones (spongy hail), or the development of a liquid water coat under wet growth conditions. Vertical structure of the Zdr fields was also examined. As hypothesized by Conway and Zrnic, it was found that the distinctness of the positive Zdr column associated with supercooled raindrops and incompletely frozen particles above the 0 degreesC height varies from storm to storm.

AB  - Thirty-six Coleoptera (beetle) taxa and other insects were identified from the late-glacial and early-Holocene sediments at Krakenes Lake. Compared with other Scandinavian late-glacial sites, this is a rather sparse record. The water beetles found in the Allerod are characteristic of a poorly vegetated clear-water lake. The terrestrial fauna is indicative of dwarf-shrub and moss vegetation. A marked decline in the number of species at the start of the Younger Dryas was rather rapid, probably over less than 80 calendar yrs. No obligate tundra species replaced the Allerod fauna. Most of the Younger Dryas is virtually devoid of beetles. The increase in numbers and diversity of both aquatic and terrestrial species at the Younger Dryas/Holocene transition is very rapid. After an initial pioneer stage, beetles associated with dwarf-shrub heath and willow scrub appeared, but no obligate tree or forest taxa were recorded.
   Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) temperature reconstructions suggest that the Allerod was colder and more continental than present. The near absence of beetles in the Younger Dryas probably reflects very cold conditions. A rapid temperature rise at the start of the Holocene resulted in a warmer and more continental climate than present.

AB  - Shigella flexneri was shown to possess a homologue of the Escherichia coli K-12 topA gene which encodes DNA topoisomerase I. The S. flexneri topA gene was replaced by a copy of the E. coli K-12 topA gene which has been insertionally inactivated by transposon Tn 10. The topoisomer distribution of reporter plasmids showed that the presence of this topA lesion in S. flexneri correlated with an increase in the level of negative DNA supercoiling in the mutant, indicating that topoisomerase I is required to relax DNA in S. flexneri as it is in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The introduction of the topA mutation also resulted in repression of transcription of a thermally regulated invasion gene located on the 230 kb virulence plasmid. In addition, the topA mutant was hypersensitive to growth medium osmolarity, was unable to grow on MacConkey indicator plates and exhibited an increased doubling time under all growth conditions tested. All of these phenotypes were fully complemented in trans by a cloned copy of the E. coli topA gene carried on a recombinant plasmid. Unlike E. coli topA mutants which acquire compensatory mutations at a high frequency, such compensatory mutations were not detected in the S. flexneri topA::Tn10 mutant.

AB  - Environmental pollution has been a problem waiting for solutions worldwide in recent years. Pollution with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), oil, and petroleum derivatives, may have long- and short-term environmental and health effects. Bee products are used as bioindicators to determine environmental pollution. In this work, 16 PAHs compounds were analyzed in honey samples from different Turkey regions by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS). In this work, the modern extraction method (QuEChERS) was selective and sensitive enough to extract 16 PAHs from honey samples. High amounts of naphthalene (22.5 mu g kg(-1)), acenaphthylene (16.2 mu g kg(-1)), acenaphthene (17.3 mu g kg(-1)), fluorene (13.3 mu g kg(-1)), phenanthrene (14.5 mu g kg(-1)), fluoranthene (11.9 mu g kg(-1)), benzo(b)fluoranthene (12.6 mu g kg(-1)), benzo(k)fluoranthene (12.7 mu g kg(-1)), and benzo(a)pyrene (11.7 mu g kg(-1)) were detected. Besides, PAHs levels in the Marmara region were very high. The differences in PAHs content between honey from rural and urban areas could be related to atmospheric conditions such as exhaust gases, dust, and airborne particles or from soils in which the plants grow.

AB  - We report the first survey of shallow-water foraminifera from the Selvagens Islands, an isolated archipelago located in the subtropical Northeast Atlantic. In our samples, we identified 63 species of foraminifera belonging to 43 genera in the >63 mu m fraction, including eight species of symbiont-bearing Larger Benthic Foraminifera (LBFs). The assemblages consist mostly of epiphytic species and species associated with coarse grain and hard substrate habitats. Analysis of dead assemblages revealed two main clusters that mostly correspond with the two island groups within the archipelago and relates to their environmental characteristics. Our results provide illustrated baseline information for this remote and relatively pristine habitat, wherein foraminifer community assemblages show a higher degree of similarity to those of the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and Bermuda as compared to those of Mauritania, Northwest Africa. Hence, this study suggests that geographic proximity and oceanic barriers plays a lesser role than environmental parameters when determining foraminiferal biogeography. In addition, given that all LBF species reported in Selvagens are also present across the Atlantic Ocean, our results suggest that the previously defined 'Caribbean' LBF realm should be extended to the subtropical North Atlantic, taking into account local conditions, particularly minimal temperatures, controlling specific LBF assemblages.

AB  - Sensitive detection of biological events is a goal for the design and characterization of sensors that can be used in vitro and in vivo. One important second messenger is Ca++ which has been a focus of using genetically encoded Ca++ indicators (GECIs) within living cells or intact organisms in vivo. An ideal GECI would exhibit high signal intensity, excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), rapid kinetics, a large dynamic range within relevant physiological conditions, and red-shifted emission. Most available GECIs are based on fluorescence, but bioluminescent GECIs have potential advantages in terms of avoiding tissue autofluorescence, phototoxicity, photobleaching, and spectral overlap, as well as enhancing SNR. Here, we summarize current progress in the development of bioluminescent GECIs and introduce a new and previously unpublished biosensor. Because these biosensors require a substrate, we also describe the pros and cons of various substrates used with these sensors. The novel GECI that is introduced here is called CalBiT, and it is a Ca++ indicator based on the functional complementation of NanoBiT which shows a high dynamic change in response to Ca++ fluxes. Here, we use CalBiT for the detection of Ca++ fluctuations in cultured cells, including its ability for real-time imaging in living cells.

AB  - Pyrethroids (deltamethrin) are increasingly being used in modern agriculture. In addition, cadmium (Cd) has considerable use in a wide spectrum of industrial fields. Consequently, combined pollution with deltamethrin (DM) and Cd is a common phenomenon in soil. In this study, the toxic effects of DM and Cd were investigated alone and in combination. Plant tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were treated with deltamethrin (25 mu M) or Cd (100 mu M) or with DM-Cd co-contamination for 7 days. Both DM and Cd were significantly affected growth rate and reduced the levels of photosynthetic pigments though Cd seemed to be more deleterious than DM. Furthermore, DM and Cd induced hydrogen peroxide accumulation, lipid peroxidation, upregulated of anti-oxidative enzyme activities (APX, CAT, POD and PAL) and non-enzymatic such as proline, and reduced glutathione. These results revealed that oxidative stress is involved in the toxicity of DM and Cd, and proved that under a co-exposing condition, DM and Cd had a synergistic effect on the growth and content of photosynthetic pigments and an antagonistic interaction on antioxidant defense. Further studies on mixture toxicities are needed to explore the detailed mechanism of synergetic interaction to improve the environmental risk assessment of chemicals by applying the OMIC approaches.

AB  - Decline in total phosphorus (TP) during lake reoligotrophication does not apparently immediately influence carbon assimilation or deep-water oxygen levels. Traditional monitoring and interpretation do not typically consider the amount of organic carbon exported from the productive zone into the hypolimnion as a measure of net ecosystem production. This research investigated the carbon-to-phosphorus ratios of suspended particles in the epilimnion, (C:P)(epi), as indicators of changing productivity. We report sestonic C:P ratios, phytoplankton biomass, and hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates in Lake Hallwil, a lake whose recovery from eutrophic conditions has been documented in 35 years of historic water-monitoring data. This study also interpreted long-term (C:P)(epi) ratios from reoligotrophication occurring in four other lakes. Lake Hallwil exhibited three distinct phases. (i) The (C:P)(epi) ratio remained low when TP concentrations did not limit production. (ii) (C:P)(epi) increased steadily when phytoplankton began optimizing the declining P and biomass remained stable. (iii) Below a critical TP threshold of similar to 15 to similar to 20 mg P m(-3), (C:P) epi remained high and the biomass eventually declined. This analysis showed that the (C:P)(epi) ratio indicates the reduction of productivity prior to classic indicators such as deep-water oxygen depletion.

To find NK-92 indicator to cytolytic activity, we have evaluated the potential markers by quantifying the expression of well-known cytotoxicity functional molecules (cytokine IFN-gamma, Granzyme B, perforin, CD69 and CD107a), and explored candidate markers by a sweeping transcription picture of NK-92 using a direct cytolysis model (incubation with K562). We found that IFN-gamma secretion was highly correlated to cytotoxicity of NK-92, neither Granzyme B, perforin secretion, nor CD69, CD107a positive population were upregulated by K562 stimulation. RNAseq revealed 432 genes expression changed during cytolysis, several genes (BIRC3, CSF2, VCAM1 and TNFRSF9) mRNA expression were validated by real time RT-PCR under K562 being killed or protected from being killed conditions. Results suggested IFN-gamma secretion, BIRC3 and TNFRSF9 transcription in NK-92 were responsive to K562 cytolysis. In a word, our results confirmed one marker and reveal an array of novel candidate markers associated with NK-92 cytotoxicity. Further studies are greatly needed to determine the roles these new makers play in NK-92 cytolysis process.

AB  - Cucurbita crops are among the most valuable and widely cultivated vegetable crops in global agriculture. Cucurbit seed oil meets the requirements of functional nutrition; it is material for the food industry and medicines based on natural ingredients. The present research was aimed at studying features of the biochemical composition of oil in seeds of the main cultivated Cucurbita L. species from the collection of the N.I. Vavilov Institute (VIR) grown in the conditions of the Astrakhan Experiment Station (AES) of VIR. The oil content in seeds of Cucurbita L. species varied from 40 to 49.7%. Over 80% of the fatty acids (FA) composition (FAC) was represented by oleic (13.6-49.6) and linoleic (33.5-69.3%) acids. The accessions of Cucurbita mixta Pang. were noted for high values of saturated FAs (palmitic and stearic), those of Cucurbita pepo var. melopepo (L.) Harz. of linoleic and linolenic, and those of Cucurbita pepo L. of oleic acid. The multiple factor analysis showed significant differences in FAC in accessions of C. pepo var. melopepo, Cucurbita maxima Duch. and C. pepo. The performed study allowed us to reveal FAC features in seeds of each Cucurbita species from the VIR collection and to identify the accessions with the best economically important indicators.

AB  - The relevance of this article is conditioned by the need to take into account environmental risks, reduce the negative impact of industrial production on the environment. An effective tool solving these problems is the concept of a circular economy, which is a promising area of modern economic science. The purpose of this article is to determine the principles that enable the introduction of a circular economy in Russian industry. Using the methods of content analysis, the authors determined the origins of the studied concept in the USSR, as well as its relationship with the theory of sustainable development and the green economy. It is proved that the existing principles of industrial recycling, which define the concept of a circular economy, need to be supplemented, since they do not contain the description of the economic effects of their implementation in production. The authors indicated that the key principles are the principle of accounting and assessing the potential cost of waste, the principle of resource differentiation, the principle of saving from the use of renewable resources, and the principle of a product life increase. The developed principles are supplemented by the description of business strategies, the measures of institutional regulation, as well as the criteria for economic efficiency evaluation. The results of the study can be used to develop the strategies introducing a circular economy in industrial organizations.

AB  - Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) is a type of reactive oxygen species involved in numerous physiological activities. We previously reported that O-1(2)-specific oxidation products are increased in patients with prediabetes, suggesting that measurement of O-1(2) may be an important indicator of physiological and pathological conditions. The turnover in the generation and quenching of O-1(2) is extremely rapid during biological activities owing to it high reactivity and short lifetime in solution. However, the dynamic changes in O-1(2) generation in living cells have not been fully explored. In this study, we investigated whether the kinetics of O-1(2) generation can be quantified using a far-red fluorescent probe for mitochondrial O-1(2), Si-DMA, following addition of the O-1(2) generator, endoperoxide, to mammalian cells. The kinetics of Si-DMA fluorescence intensity dose-dependently increased following treatment of mammalian living cells with endoperoxide. Alternatively, treatment with O-1(2) quenchers decreased the fluorescence intensities following endoperoxide treatment. Our results indicate that the kinetics of intracellular O-1(2) can be readily obtained using Si-DMA and time-lapse imaging, which provides new insights into the mechanism of O-1(2) generation in mammalian cells and the exploration of O-1(2) generators and quenchers.

AB  - This paper elaborates the concept of the renewable district heating system (DHS) in Municipality of Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of the CoolHeating project funded by the EU's Horizon 2020 programme, which is going to be integrated into the planned DHS supplied by a combined heat and power facility (CHP).
   Forecast of the demand, type and capacities of the production units, as well as optimization of the production plan, was performed by the software EnergyPRO. Calculations are based on inputs such as climate conditions, connection rate for housing facilities, prices of all energy sources, energy efficiency performance of the facilities, temperature level of DHS, heat losses, investment costs, operating costs such as maintenance costs, fuel and electricity prices, taxes, subsidies and finally operating time, while the period for the optimization was calculated per hour throughout the year.
   The overall approach leads to a flexible modular DHS solution based on RES and CHP. Much better economic and environmental sustainability indicators, demonstrated on real inputs of the Visoko project, have been noticed as opposed to the existing heating solution. Similar concepts can be developed for other communities to ensure replication and thus multiply the effects and contribution to sustainable development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) represents a potential secondary source of valuable materials, whose recovery is a growing business activity worldwide. In low-income countries, recycling is carried out under poorly controlled conditions resulting in severe environmental pollution. High concentrations of both metallic and organic pollutants have been confirmed in air, soil, water, and sediments in countries with informal recycling areas. The release of these contaminants into the environment presents a risk to the health of the exposed population that has been widely acknowledged but still needs to be quantified. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relative risk from inhalation associated with the open burning of different kinds of WEEE. The shrinking core model was applied to estimate the concentration of the metals which would be released into the environment during the incineration of different types of WEEE. In addition, the potential generation of dioxins during the same informal practice was estimated, based on the plastic content of the WEEE. The results provided for the first time a comparative analysis of the risk posed from the open burning of WEEE components, proposing a methodology to address the absolute risk assessment to workers from the informal recycling of WEEE.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the major source of carbon in aquatic environments and may be derived from allochthonous or autochthonous sources. This study presents the first DOM characterisation in streams from two contrasting Argentinean regions (the Pampas and Patagonia). We found that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and absorption coefficients at 254 and 350nm (a(254) and a(350)) were higher in Pampean than in Patagonian streams. DOM from streams in both regions contained compounds with high molecular weight and highly variable a(350) per DOC; it has been suggested that this could be an indicator of lignin content. The characterisation of DOM reflects the agricultural signal and the effect of autochthonous sources in Pampean streams, whereas a more pristine condition with high input from terrestrial environments was recorded in Patagonian streams. No sign of DOM photodegradation was observed in either region. Fluorescence-based indices suggest a more recent input of DOM in Pampean streams, whereas a highly humified component was recorded in Patagonian streams. The combined use of absorbance and fluorescence-based techniques was useful for understanding the quantity and quality of DOM in these contrasting regions in Argentina.

AB  - The aim of this study is to establish if the San Luis Potosi Plateau (SLPP), which is part of the southern edge of the Chihuahuan Desert, is generating desertification processes, indicating a progression of the desert toward the central part of Mexico. Therefore, we analyzed the temporal evolution of four environmental indicators of desertification: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Iron Oxides Index (IO) and Surface Temperature (ST). Landsat TM images are used to cover a period from 1990 to 2011. A new equation of total balance is proposed to generate an image of the overall evolution of each factor which is applied to get a probability map of desertification. The evolution of NDVI, NDWI and IO shows a behavior almost stable over the time. In contrast, the ST shows a slight increase. The outcomes of this study confirm periods of vegetation re-greening and 8.80% of the SLPP has the highest probability to develop desertification. The most affected area is the portion west of the region, and the east and south are the least affected areas. The results suggest a slight advance of the desert, although most of the area doesn't have the necessary conditions to develop desertification.

AB  - Previous studies revealed large differences in the transformation of pharmaceuticals in rivers with similar characteristics. The present work aimed at answering the question whether these differences are related to the transformation capacity of the specific river sediments. More generally, we also aimed at evaluating the overall diagnostic power of water/sediment tests. Incubation experiments with 9 pharmaceuticals were carried out with sediments sampled from three rivers. All compounds expect carbamazepine were removed at dissipation half-lives between 2.5 and 56 days; biotransformation was identified as the major removal process. Interestingly, sediment from river Roter Main was more efficient in removing pharmaceuticals than sediment from river Griindlach, while the opposite pattern was observed in previous field studies. Obviously, the physical boundary conditions are governing the actual elimination of pharmaceuticals and not the transformation potential of the specific sediments. In a separate experiment, an immediate onset of transformation was observed after introducing oxygen to an anoxic water/sediment system. Transformation rates in sediments sampled from several sites within one river varied up to a factor of 2.5. This considerable in-stream variability is a critical factor for environmental risk assessment where single cutoff values are being used for evaluating a compound's persistence.

AB  - This study aimed to quantify the light organic matter mass (LOM) in water, free light fraction (FLF) of soil organic matter (SOM) and carbon (C), nitrogen (N) contents and natural abundance of delta C-13 e delta N-15 contained in the mass of LOM, C and N in the FLF in land use systems in the Cerrado region of Goias State, Brazil. Were evaluated a crop-livestock integration system - CLIS (corn+brachiaria/bean/cotton/soybean) and no-tillage system - NTS (sunflower/millet/soybean/corn). The vegetal coverage of natural Cerrado, adjacent to NTS and CLIS, was considered as the original soil condition. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0.0-5.0 and 5.0-10.0 cm in full random experimental design. The CLIS showed the greatest mass and levels of C-LOM (5-10 cm), and too greatest mass and levels of C and N of FLF (0-10 cm) when compared with the NTS. Regarding the Cerrado, the CLIS showed higher values for N-LOM and 1 delta 15N-LOM (0-5 cm), C and N of FLF (0-5 cm). Through physical indicators LOM and FLF, it was possible to infer that the CLIS increased the SOM fractions when compared to the NTS.

AB  - Hilly regions are prone to landslides that cause heavy losses of life and properties every year. A number of researches and analyses are carried out in the GIS environment to identify landslide vulnerability in the region. The important conditioning factors identified by the researchers are slope, geological, geomorphologic features, and land use coupled with triggering factors like rainfall and a few of the anthropogenic activities. Soil forms the uppermost part of the earth crust, and it is expected that various soil characteristics like depth, surface texture, depth texture, soil erosion, hydraulic conductivity, stoniness, etc., play significant roles in causing landslide in the area. These factors have been ignored so far by most researchers while identifying landslide hazard-prone areas. This paper attempts to assess the vulnerability status in parts of East Sikkim, India, by integrating the influence of the various soil attributes. A composite index called soil stability value was determined by aggregating the weights assigned to different soil parameters. Finally, based on the soil stability values, the study area was classified into least vulnerable, moderately vulnerable, and most vulnerable zones of landslide occurrences. Comparison between the vulnerability zones and the actual landslide occurrences yielded a 90% agreement with the density of landslides in the most vulnerable zone, demonstrating the efficacy of soil characteristics as potential indicators of landslide events.

AB  - The potential use of specific somatic coliphage taxonomic groups as viral indicators based on their persistence and prevalence in water was investigated. Representative type strains of the 4 major somatic coliphage taxonomic groups were seeded into reagent water and an ambient surface water source of drinking water and the survival of the added phages was measured over 90 days at temperatures of 23-25 and 4 degrees C. Microviridae (type strain PhiX174), Siphoviridae (type strain Lambda), and Myoviridae (type strain T4) viruses were the most persistent in water at the temperatures tested. The Microviridae (type strain PhiX174) and the Siphoviridae (type strain Lambda) were the most resistant viruses to UV radiation and the Myoviridae (type strain T4) and the Microviridae (type strain PhiX174) were the most resistant viruses to heat. Based on their greater persistence in water over time and their relative resistance to heat and/or UV radiation, the Myoviridae (type strain T4), the Microviridae (type strain PhiX174), and the Siphoviridae (type strain Lambda) were the preferred candidate somatic coliphages as fecal indicator viruses in water, with the Microviridae (type strain PhiX174) the most resistant to these conditions overall.

AB  - Forest biodiversity cannot be measured and monitored directly. Indicators are needed to tackle this task and must be based on scientifically valid relationships concerning different levels of biodiversity. In addition, indicators must provide tangible goals for forest policy and other relevant stakeholders. Here, we propose a single aggregated measure - the Austrian Forest Biodiversity Index (AFBI) - which is composed of different indicator values being weighed depending on their significance for the maintenance of forest species richness and genetic diversity. The AFBI consists of nine state and four response indicators. Selection of state indicators was based on the general hypothesis that forests which mimic natural conditions or are characterised by structural elements of old-growth forests maintain a high number of forest dependent species and a high genetic richness therein. Among the response indicators we considered the establishment of natural forest reserves, genetic reserve forests, seed stands and seed orchards as most relevant. Proposed operational tools, especially for state indicators, are mainly based oil the Austrian forest inventory. The sum of all weighted indicator measures is rescaled as a total score that may vary from 0 to 100, so that the AFBI is simple to communicate and straightforward to apply. The AFBI gives certain weight to genetic parameters which are often neglected in previous approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three ethylene diurea (EDU) concentrations (0, 150 and 300 mg/L) were used to evaluate the negative impact of ozone (O-3) on two cultivars of Trifolium repens L. cv. Vardan and Bundel grown under natural field conditions in a suburban area of Varanasi, India. Mean O-3 concentrations varied from 30.3 to 46.6 mu g/L during the experimental period. Higher photosynthetic pigments and ascorbic acid concentrations were noticed in both EDU-treated cultivars over non-EDU-treated ones, but a reverse trend was found for lipid peroxidation. Growth parameters and biomass also showed increments under EDU treatment of both cultivars. The ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence increased significantly in Vardan but not in Bundel upon EDU treatment. Results revealed that EDU concentration of 300 mg/L was more effective to combat the oxidative stress as well as protecting plants from O-3 injury symptoms. The test cultivar Vardan is relatively sensitive to O-3, thereby can be used as a bioindicator of O-3 pollution in areas having higher O-3 concentrations. Results also indicated that Bundel has more efficient antioxidant defense system than Vardan and hence was more tolerant to O-3 stress.

AB  - A mapping population of 114 lines from Bala x Azucena was grown under drought stress at two field sites with contrasting soil physical properties. Drought was imposed between 35 and 65 days after sowing (DAS) and root density at 35 cm depth was measured 70 DAS. Leaf rolling, leaf drying and relative water content were recorded as indicators of drought avoidance. Root density correlated with indicators of drought avoidance. Two significant and two putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root density and 28 QTLs for drought avoidance were identified. Most QTLs did not agree between sites. There was also reasonable agreement between leaf-drying QTLs and previously reported root-growth QTLs detected under controlled conditions (in contrast to a previous screen on soil with a higher penetration resistance). These data also reveal QTL x environment interaction, which will need to be understood more clearly if progress towards breeding for drought resistance via alterations of root morphology is to be achieved.

AB  - Fishers often rely on their social capital to cope with resource fluctuations by sharing information on the abundance and location of fish. Drawing on research in seven coastal fishing communities in Loreto, Baja California Sur, Mexico, we examine the effect of resource scarcity on the bonding, bridging, and linking social-capital patterns of fishers' information-sharing networks. We found that: (1) fishers' information sharing is activated in response to varying ecological conditions; (2) resource scarcity is an ambiguous indicator of the extent to which fishers share information on the abundance and location of fish within and between communities; (3) information sharing is based on trust and occurs through kinship, friendship, and acquaintance social relations; (4) friendship ties play a key and flexible role in fishers' social networks within and between communities; (5) overall, the composition of fishers' social networks follows a friendship>kinship>acquaintance order of importance; and (6) the function of social ties, internal conflict, and settlement histories moderate the effects of resource scarcity on fishers' social capital. We conclude by arguing that the livelihoods of fishers from Loreto have adaptive capacity for dealing with fish fluctuations but little or no proactive resilience to address resource- management issues.

AB  - Comprehensive morphometric analysis of osteological and necropsy specimens indicates that blunt heads and wide jaws, both of which create a more circular mouth opening and thus improve water flow for suction feeding, are common in Odontoceti and found in all families except freshwater river dolphins (Platanistoidea), which are exclusively long-snouted. Mandibular bluntness, here termed amblygnathy, correlates with dental reduction in odontocetes there is a further association of reduced dentition with increased body length. Examination of quantitative data reveals that many odontocetes, especially globicephaline delphinids, have a blunter cranial profile (partly from facial musculature and other soft tissues) and fewer exposed teeth for grasping prey than is generally supposed, especially when the researcher relies solely on examination of skeletal materials. Numerous teeth present in cleaned skulls and jaws remain unerupted even in adults, as verified by necropsy tooth counts, rendering tooth counts from museum specimens unreliable indicators of in vivo conditions. Amblygnathy and smaller, rounder mouth openings correlate with other anatomical, ecological, and behavioral traits associated with suction feeding. It is likely that odontocete suction ingestion evolved independently in multiple lineages from use of suction to transport grasped prey in long-jawed ancestors, with consequent loss of the grasp and transport step as prey are sucked directly into the oral cavity or oropharynx.

AB  - Nematodes of the genus Heterorhabditis are insect parasites that are widely used as biological control agents. When conditions are unfavourable for reproduction in H. bacteriophora, a long-lived, non-feeding, survival and dispersal stage, the dauer juvenile (DJ), is formed. This DJ stage is also adapted for host finding and infection. When it infects a suitable host, the DJ recovers and resumes growth and development. We describe a series of methods for improved detection of recovery in H. bacteriophora. We also describe some of the physiological changes that occur immediately after the onset of recovery in these nematodes as revealed using fluorescent nucleic acid binding SYTO dyes. Although recovery could be monitored using morphological changes, we found that observation of the uptake of fluorescent latex microspheres by recovering nematodes was a far more sensitive and efficient means of detecting recovery. SYTO dyes were also found to be useful indicators of recovery, binding to the pharyngeal glands and genital primordia as little as 3 h after the onset of recovery. The use of SYTO dyes also indicated that the pharyngeal glands produce large quantities of RNA following the onset of recovery, implying that these structures may produce proteins important in the infection and/or feeding process of H. bacteriophora.

AB  - Excessive fecal coliform bacteria in public swimming waters can potentially threaten visitor health. Fecal coliform bacteria (1984-1989) and Escherichia coli (1990-1995) density were monitored weekly at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore beaches for 12 summers, and park officials closed swimming areas when fecal coliform density exceeded the state water quality criteria (400 CFU fecal coliforms/100 ml; 235 CFU E. coli/100 mi water). Due to a 24-hour incubation in the fecal coliform and E. coli assays, beaches were closed the day after collection of high fecal coliform. Our analysis suggests that it is not possible to predict one day's fecal coliform count based on the previous day's results in waters taken from southern Lake Michigan beaches. Dispersal and deposition of bacteria were not uniform among sites or across time apparently due to interactions among environmental variables including rainfall, wind direction, water temperature, and bacteria source. Rainfall combined with northwest winds increased bacteria concentrations. Escherichia coli followed a seasonal trend with similar fluctuations in density among beaches. We suggest that the current beach monitoring protocol is inadequate for predicting fecal coliform density at the time of beach closure, and, subsequently, its use for ensuring visitor safety remains questionable.

AB  - Petroleum production in Papua New Guinea is limited to the Papuan Fold Belt. Present-day oil accumulations in fields such as Iagifu, Hedinia and Gobe are thought to be mainly derived from clay-rich, Jurassic marine source rocks containing terrestrially-derived organic matter that were deposited under oxic conditions. In this study. other generative source rocks in the Papuan Foreland are indicated using fluid inclusion (FI) oil data from three wildcat wells Koko-1. Bujon-1 and Kimu-1. which were drilled on the Bosavi Arch. Detailed organic geochemistry of these FI oils. and associated free oils or oil stains, suggests that none of these were generated from the aforementioned Jurassic source rocks. Instead, at least three different generative source rocks are indicated. Firstly, a marine, probably Late Cretaceous or younger source rock deposited under reducing conditions is indicated by the Bujon-1 FI oil. This source rock had a moderate contribution from higher plant organic matter, including oleanane and/or lupane. The Bujon-1 FI oil has similarities with FI oils from the Iagifu-7x and P'nyang-2X wells in the Papuan Fold Belt. Secondly, an algal-dominated. lacustrine source rock is indicated by the biodegraded Koko-1 R FT crude oil. the unbiodegraded FI oil from Koko-1. and the Bujon-1 oil stains from the Toro and Imburu formations. These lacustrine oils have high abundances of tricyclic terpanes, pregnane, homopregnane and gammacerane, contain beta-carotane. and have high C-26/C-25 tricyclic terpane ratios. The source of the lacustrine oils is inferred to contain moderate amounts of terrestrial organic matter. indicated by a dominance of C-29 steranes and abundant aromatic higher plant biomarkers. and could be gypsiferous shales embedded in Oligocene-Miocene carbonates, or Triassic-age sediments deposited on igneous basement during early rifting associated with the break-up of Gondwana. The Kimu-1 FI oil was generated from a mature, marine, suboxic source rock, but has a different geochemical composition to free oil from a similar interval. which was derived from a carbonate-rich source rock.
   None of the FI oils correlate well with oil families previously described in Papua New Guinea. Accordingly. the oils recovered from FIs in this part of the Papuan Basin support the presence of laterally varying source rock compositions and qualities, and indicate that there are opportunities to develop new charge models for features across the Papuan Foreland. Furthermore, Koko-1, Bujon-1 and Kimu-1 FI oils have different geochemical compositions compared to the associated free oils or oil stains, indicating that each of these localities has a multi-phase charge history. Further work to lower exploration risk in the Papuan Foreland should be directed to understanding the distribution, maturity and expulsion history of these newly recognised potential source rocks.

AB  - Three different global earth system models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were used to explore anticipated changes in the Bering Sea under high (SSP126) and low (SSP585) carbon mitigation scenarios (i.e. low and high emission scenarios), via dynamical downscaling. A multivariate pattern analysis, based on Empirical Orthogonal Functions applied to monthly time series, reveals strong coupling of changes across several biophysical variables and the global forcing itself, on both yearly and multidecadal time scales. Rising air and ocean temperatures from the global models are strongly coupled with rising regional temperatures and reduced ice cover/thickness, as well as strong changes to the phenology of the plankton food chain, including reduced biomass of large zooplankton in the fall. This method ultimately provides a compact way to estimate the changes to many regional attributes under a variety of global change scenarios. Application of this method to a broad ensemble of the CMIP6 global model air temperatures suggests that compared to present conditions, the Bering Sea shelf bottom temperatures in July will warm by an average of -4 degrees C by the end of the 21st century under SSP585, as compared with -1 degrees C under SSP126, with greatest warming focused on the outer northern shelf.

AB  - The Late Devonian witnessed landscape evolution, increased atmospheric O2 level, intense organic and volcanic activities and initial expansion of earliest wildfires. This paper is focused on petrographic and geochemical studies of Famennian inertinite-bearing marine shale facies in northern Kerman (central Iran), a Late Devonian key area in north of Gondwana.Our studies point to a wildfire activity. During the Famennian, the wildfire activity occurred in lowland vegetation (covered by lycopods) under warm and humid conditions. The moderately hot burning temperature (446.7 degrees C to 487.9 degrees C) of the fire and the type of the land vegetation suggest prevalence of a surface wildfire. Following the burning of the land plants, the ground became exposed to weathering that could result in erosion of the soil. Inputs of terrestrial organic matter, nutrients (particularly phosphate) and detrital materials into a nearshore marine environment were mainly controlled by proximity of the depositional environment to the terrestrial source, intense continental weathering of rocks and the soil in the land, wildfire and continental runoff during rainfall. Generally, preservation and enrichment of organic matter and formation of macerals were controlled by wildfire activity, transportation, oxidation, bacterial/fungal degradation and detrital input.

AB  - This study identified the role of and challenges faced by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) proponents in Punjab, Pakistan. Expected roles of proponents in EIA were taken from regulations, legislation and guidelines. The comments of consultants, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) regarding the role played by proponents were extracted from literature and used for evaluation. To identify the challenges of proponents in each step of the EIA, 40 semi-structured interviews were conducted with private and government proponents in Punjab. Oftentimes, projects start prior to obtaining an environmental approval. Proper scoping is seldom conducted. Stakeholder involvement in EIA is limited. Proponents sometimes do not share complete project information with consultants, which compromises the report quality and timely decision making. Moreover, some proponents attempt to influence the review and decision making and do not ensure compliance to approval conditions except for few multinationals. The key challenge highlighted by proponents was the discrimination on part of the EPA between private and government projects. Other challenges included lack of professionalism of some consultants and delayed and non-transparent decision making. Although regional in scope, the results of the study hold importance for EIA systems worldwide particularly in countries with similar economic systems who are facing a trade-off between economic growth and environmental sustainability.

AB  - The pollution performance of insulators installed in transmission and distribution lines plays a key role in maintaining the reliability, safety and cost-effectiveness of power systems. Among the different insulator monitoring techniques, leakage current stands out as one of the most meaningful pollution performance indicators as it gives a measure of how close the insulators string is to flashover. This paper presents a novel methodology for the prediction of the leakage current on insulator strings considering the environmental and weather information of the insulators location. It is based on the combination of a new developed Cumulative Pollution Index (CPI), which estimates the soluble pollution deposit on the insulator string, and a machine learning technique such as Random Forests algorithm. The method is valid for ceramic insulators, i.e., toughened glass, as well as RTV silicone-coated insulators with hydrophobic transfer properties. The research is supported by an extensive field monitoring program where three different insulator strings composed by non-coated, half-coated (bottom part) and full-silicone-coated glass insulators were monitored in a period covering twenty-two consecutive months. Finally, the performance of the proposed prediction model is evaluated using real data.

AB  - Organ preformation in overwintering buds of perennial plants has been known for almost two centuries. It is hypothesized to underlie fast growth and early flowering, but its frequency, phylogenetic distribution, and ecological relevance have never been systematically examined. We microscopically observed inflorescence preformation in overwintering buds (IPB) in the autumn. We studied a phylogenetically and ecologically representative set of 330 species of temperate perennial angiosperms and linked these observations with quantitative data on species' flowering phenology, genome size, and ecology. IPB was observed in 34% of species examined (in 14% species the stamens and/or pistils were already developed). IPB is fairly phylogenetically conserved and frequent in many genera (Alchemilla,Carex,Euphorbia,Geranium,Primula,Pulmonaria) or families (Ranunculaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Violaceae, Boraginaceae). It was found in species of any genome size, although it was almost universal in those with large genomes. Compared with non-IPB species, IPB species flowered 38 d earlier on average and were more common in shaded and undisturbed habitats. IPB is a surprisingly widespread adaptation for early growth in predictable (undisturbed) conditions. It contributes to temporal niche differentiation and has important consequences for understanding plant phenology, genome size evolution, and phylogenetic structure of plant communities.

AB  - Hybrid photovoltaic installations, defined as on-grid PV system in cooperation with battery energy storage system (BESS), are still rare among the typical investors because the investment cost of the hybrid installation is significantly higher than the one of the on-grid system. However, while considering the broader perspective, such as environmental or technological aspects, the mentioned solution can be competitive with photovoltaic on-grid systems and therefore should be carefully tested in the widest possible context. In this study, the authors compared 3.05 kW of peak power hybrid and on-grid installations operating in temperate climate conditions (Eastern Poland) using economic indicators, such as dynamic generation cost (DGC) and benefit-cost rate (BCR); environmental impact indicators (IMPACT 2002+ and GWP 100a) determined using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); and technological aspects consideration, including the reliability of examined systems. Creating a ranking of the considered solutions based on the equal weighting factors assigned to the appropriate features allows indicating the technological areas where the competitiveness of hybrid systems justifies the increased investment costs. One such area is business, where the economic criterion, the only negatively assessed one in the standard operation, can be radically changed by the possible financial losses due to interruption of energy supply.

AB  - Rice production in Ecuador is steadily affected by extreme climatic events that make it difficult for farmers to cope with production risk, threatening rural livelihoods and food security in the country. Developing agricultural insurance is a policy option that has gained traction in the last decade. Index-based agricultural insurance has become a promising alternative that allows insurance companies to ascertain and quantify losses without verifying a catastrophic event in situ, lowering operative costs and easing implementation. But its development can be hindered by basis risk, which occurs when real losses in farms do not fit accurately with the selected index. Avoiding basis risk requires assessing the variability within the insurance application area and considering it for representative index selection. In this context, we have designed an index-based insurance (IBI) that uses a vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index - NDVI) as an indicator of drought and flood impact on rice in the canton of Babahoyo (Ecuador). Babahoyo was divided in two agro-ecological homogeneous zones (AHZs) to account for variability, and two NDVI threshold values were defined to consider, first, the event impact on crops (physiological threshold) and, second, its impact on the gross margin (economic threshold). This design allows us to set up accurate insurance premiums and compensation that fit the particular conditions of each AHZ, reducing basis risk.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) adjacent to the Kruger National Park (KNP) are divided into fenced and unfenced properties. We discuss land-use development to provide context of how these savannas have evolved over the past century. Although the PAs have embraced the basic philosophies of the KNP management approach and have similar high-level objectives, they function at different spatial, and consequently temporal scales, largely because of fencing and the subsequent provision of water in these areas. We examine bottom up (environmental, rainfall) conditions using rainfall as a percentage of the mean and the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) leading into five drought periods dating back to 1982/1983 and top-down drivers focusing on animal number and type (geo-referenced data from annual helicopter counts) on fenced versus areas open to the larger KNP system. We then examine the response variables, grass species composition, cover and standing crop (all using the Multiple Indicator Method) and the capacity of these to attain a variety of potential land use objectives. Using a dataset spanning some 30 years, we provide scenarios that offer an early warning system to managers irrespective of land use objectives and management approach (laissez-faire or active).

Methods to predict microbial turnover and biogenic NER have been developed, having limited use when metabolites accumulate, the chemicals are not the only C source, or provide for other macroelements. To improve predictive capability, we extended a recently developed method for microbial growth yield estimation to account for incomplete degradation and multiple-element assimilation and combined it with a dynamic model for fate description in soils and sediments. We evaluated the results against the unique experimental data of C-13(3)-N-15 co-labeled glyphosate turnover with AMPA formation in water-sediment systems (OECD 308). Balancing C-13- and N-13-fluxes to biomass showed a pronounced shift of glyphosate transformation from full mineralization to AMPA formation. This may be explained by various hypotheses, for example, the limited substrate turnover inherent to the batch conditions of the test system causing microbial starvation or inhibition by P release. Modeling results indicate initial N overload due to the lower C/N ratio in glyphosate compared to average cell composition leading to subsequent C demand and accumulation of AMPA.

AB  - This paper reconceptualises absorptive capacity as a strategic human resource construct and analyses its role in determining R&D cooperation and innovation in firms. In spite of widespread consensus on the role of absorptive capacity in innovation, the literature has so far concentrated only on traditional R&D and human capital based indicators of absorptive capacity. Furthermore, most firm-level studies investigating this relationship are cross-sectional in nature and there is need for longitudinal evidence. Employing the IAB Establishment Panel Survey on about 1200 private sector establishments in Germany during 2007-2011, we apply a structural model that links firms' human resource practices, R&D collaboration strategies and finally their innovation outcome. Findings from the first stage of the empirical analysis suggest that adoption of employment practices positively affects horizontal, institutional and consulting-based R&D cooperation, while compensation programs positively affect only horizontal R&D cooperation. In the second stage, the effect of cooperative R&D conditioned upon human resource practices on innovation performance is examined. Results indicate that firms having institutional and consulting-based R&D cooperation relationships are more often associated with higher incremental product, process and new-to-market innovation, whereas the effect is relatively weaker in case of horizontal R&D cooperation.

AB  - Two formulated diets were evaluated to replace live crab (C) as feed for juveniles Enteroctopus megalocyathus. Formulated diets consisted of crab paste (CP) and a mixture of freeze-dried meals of crab and squid (C&S). After 10weeks of feeding, the effect of each diet was analysed on productive performance, nutritional and physiological condition and immune system. Both the crab and C&S diets produced the best values for specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio. The diet C&S proved to be the most digestible with greatest metabolized energy. The CP diet was similar to the C diet in terms of biological value and protein apparent digestibility; nevertheless, its performance was weaker for the other indicators. Furthermore, the highest -amylase, lipase and alkaline proteolytic activity values were observed in octopuses fed live crab, as opposed to those fed formulated feeds. The type of diet did not affect lysozyme activity in neither mucus nor haemolymph. The production of reactive oxygen species was highest in octopuses fed CP diet. It is proposed the use of C&S diet to study the nutritional requirements and to develop an optimal formulated diet for juvenile Patagonian red octopus.

AB  - Studies were conducted on the eleven largest and oldest ponds in the mesoregion Western Polesie in Eastern Poland. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of environmental variables on species richness and vegetation cover of ponds. The analyzed variables included hydraulic parameters of ponds, water quality and buffer zone management. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied to reveal principal variation patterns within the data. There were a different number of species comprising the phytolittoral zone in the investigated ponds. This study also showed that ponds are valuable for plant biodiversity. In total 75 species of plants occurred in the studied complex. The total number of species ranged from 10 to 49 in pond. The water of the ponds is characterized by very low value for most tested water quality indicators. The ponds are characterized by statistically significant differences of the buffer zone management. They have similar environmental conditions (temporariness of flooding period, low depth, water quality) and they potentially can share similar species. Our results also showed that the relationships between macrophyte species and cover depends on buffer zone management and some physicochemical variables of water.

AB  - The role of soil could be decisive for the neutralization of the acid solution and immobilization of the metallic contaminants produced by mining industry. We studied micromorphological indicators of the interaction between the acid solution and soil material in the profile of Fluvisol at the Bacanuchi river (Sonora River Basin, Mexico) terrace affected by the catastrophic mine spill and in analyzing sample from a soil column treated with an acid liquid imitating the spill. Original unaffected soil is sandy with poorly developed pedogenetic features, however, frequent primary and secondary micritic and sparitic carbonates define high pH values. In the soil influenced by acid solutions under natural and laboratory conditions, carbonates were absent whereas neoformed gypsum crystals with radial intergrowth were observed together with accumulation of fine material enriched in ferruginous pigment. Micromorphometric quantification of the iron-rich fine material has shown its increase after interaction with the acid solution. We conclude that the interaction consisted of the neutralization reaction between the more reactive phases of the soil and the acid solution during which carbonates were consumed and gypsum was neoformed. Fine iron oxides precipitated after neutralization of acidity, the pH increased and the color changed. It is highly probable that other metallic contaminants co-precipitated with the ferruginous components.

AB  - Saffron essential oil has a pleasant aroma and medicinal activities. However, it is sensible into the environmental condition. Therefore, it should be protected against unwanted changes during storage or processing. Encapsulation is introduced as a process by which liable materials are protected from unwanted changes. In the present study, different ratios (0: 100, 25: 75, 50: 50, 75: 25, and 100: 0) of B-cyclodextrin (B CD) and arabic gum (GA) were used as wall martial for encapsulation saffron essential oil. In order to calculate of loading capacity (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE), and release (RE), safranal was determined as indicator of saffron essential oil using GC. According to the results, the highest LC and EE were related to the mixture of B-CD/GA at a 75: 25 ratio. In contrast, the lowest encapsulate hygroscopicity (EH) and RE were observed when only B-CD was applied as wall material (P< 0.05). Comparing the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the control and encapsulate of B-CD/GA (75: 25) confirmed encapsulation of saffron essential oil. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images with high magnifications showed the rhombic structure that partially coated by GA. The mixture of B-CD/GA at a 75: 25 ratio can be recommended for saffron essential oil encapsulation.

AB  - Environmental assessments and palaeoreconstructions can take advantage of the high diatom diversity present in mountain lakes. There are only a few studies dealing with the diatom flora of the Pyrenees and research on species taxonomy, distribution and ecology are still at an initial stage. With the aim of updating the list of species present and providing iconographic information for harmonising past and future studies, we report 549 taxa from a survey of 83 lakes across the geographical extent of the Pyrenean lakes comprising a broad range of environmental conditions and in the sedimentary record of the Burg lake. This study is a first step in the development of a comprehensive on-line atlas of Pyrenean diatoms including species occurrence, distribution and ecology (www.diatopyr.com). Samples were collected both from littoral epilithic substrates and the top of the sediment in the deepest zone of the lake. Additionally, we include also taxa that were present in the Late Glacial and Holocene sedimentary records of the Burg palaeolake, which were not found in the survey. The genera including more diversity were Pinnularia, Gomphonema, Eunotia and Nitzschia. About 25% of taxa remain to be determined at fine taxonomic resolution, many of them are likely to be species or varieties not described yet.

AB  - The requirement for nitric oxide (NO) of lysosomes has motivated the development of a sophisticated fluorescent probe to monitor the distribution of this important biomolecule at the subcellular level in living cells. A near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent Si-rhodamine (SiRB)-NO probe was designed based on the NO-induced ring-opening process of Si-rhodamine. The probe exhibits fast chromogenic and fluorogenic responses, and high sensitivity and selectivity toward trace amounts of NO. Significantly, the spirolactam in Si-rhodamine exhibits very good tolerance to H+, which in turn brings extremely low background fluorescence not only in the physiological environment but also under acidic conditions. The stability of the highly fluorescent product in acidic solution provides persistent fluorescence emission for long-term imaging experiments. To achieve targeted imaging with improved spatial resolution and sensitivity, an efficient lysosome-targeting moiety was conjugated to a SiRB-NO probe, affording a tailored lysosome-targeting NIR fluorescent Lyso-SiRB-NO probe. Inheriting the key advantages of its parent SiRB-NO probe, Lyso-SiRB-NO is a functional probe that is suited for monitoring lysosomal NO with excellent lysosome compatibility. Imaging experiments demonstrated the monitoring of both exogenous and endogenous NO in real time by using the Lyso-SiRB-NO probe.

AB  - Some efforts to assess sustainability on the urban scale have been made and different tools for measuring the impact on and caused by cities have emerged. However, the sustainability concept varies from region to region, and indicators to measure it should be suitable for the context-specific conditions of the region under study. After doing a comprehensive review of the indicators included in 13 tools developed to assess urban sustainability of cities, this article proposes a new structure of indicators adapted to a Mediterranean city in Spain. The proposed structure is based on a two-level scheme that consists in 14 categories and 63 subcategories, which agglutinate urban sustainability indicators according to their purpose. This structure suggests a set of comprehensible qualitative and quantitative indicators that are easily applicable on neighbourhood or city scales. Given the similar features of Mediterranean countries in terms of environmental and socio-economic aspects, the proposed structure could be extrapolated to other countries with climatic and cultural similarities. Otherwise, the system is a useful tool in the decision-making process to help the different stakeholders involved in new urban developments and regeneration projects in existing neighbourhoods, such as developers, urban planners and public administrations.

AB  - The development of accurate measures of animal emotions is important for improving and promoting animal welfare. Cognitive bias indicates the effect of emotional states on cognitive processes, such as memory, attention, and judgement. Cognitive bias tests complement existing behavioural and physiological measures for assessing the valence of animal emotions indirectly. The judgement bias test has been used to assess emotional states in non-human animals; mainly in laboratory settings. The aim of this review is to summarise the findings on the use of the judgement bias test approach in assessing emotions in non-human animals, focusing in particular on farm livestock. The evidence suggests that it is possible to manipulate affective states and induce judgement bias effects in farm livestock. In addition, the results support the effectiveness of manipulating environmental variables for inducing negative or positive affective states. However, the evidence from farm livestock does not consistently confirm the directionality of the hypotheses. The use of specific strategies to induce positive or negative judgement bias, such as the manipulation of housing conditions, could account for the inconsistency of findings. The study of cognitive processes related to emotional states in livestock has great potential to advance and improve our understanding of animal welfare.

AB  - The La Brea Tar Pits, the world's richest and most important Late Pleistocene fossil locality, offers unsurpassed insights into southern California's past environments. Recent studies at Rancho La Brea document that insects serve as sensitive and valuable paleoecological and taphonomic indicators. Of the thousands of fossil bird and mammal bones recovered from the Tar Pits, insect trace damage is thus far almost exclusively confined to the foot bones of large herbivores, especially bison, camel, and horse species. Our laboratory experiments with dermestid and tenebrionid beetles establish that the larvae of both consume bone, producing different characteristic feeding traces and providing the first documentation that tenebrionids consume bone. The presence of carcass-exploiting insects in the Rancho La Brea biota provides insight into the taphonomy of the asphaltic bone masses and the environmental conditions under which they accumulated. The succession of dermestids, tenebrionids, and indeterminate traces on many of the foot elements, combined with the climate restrictions and life cycles of these insects, indicate that carcasses could remain unsubmerged for at least 17-20 weeks, thus providing the most reliable estimate to date. Attribution of these traces also suggests that the asphaltic fossils only accumulated during warmer intervals of the Late Pleistocene. Forensic studies need to reevaluate the role of tenebrionids in carcass decomposition and other additional insects that modify bone.

AB  - The relationship between individual fitness and antioxidants and oxidative stress has come under increasing scrutiny of late. In particular, associations between oxidative balance indicators and reproductive success in the wild have been inconsistent in the limited prior work on this topic. Studies spanning multiple seasons and antioxidant types are particularly lacking. Here, we examined associations between reproductive success over two breeding seasons and several metrics of circulating antioxidants (antioxidant capacity, uric acid, carotenoids, and vitamin E, measured in the intervening nonbreeding season) in Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens (Bosc, 1795)). We found that carotenoid levels in the nonbreeding season were negatively associated with reproductive success in the preceding breeding season but unassociated with that in the subsequent breeding season. This correlation may be driven by the cost of reproduction (i.e., carotenoid depletion while breeding) or some other unmeasured and intercorrelated variable such as diet. Antioxidant capacity, uric acid, and vitamin E were not associated with reproductive success. These data are consistent with an emerging theme in physiological ecology: that antioxidants and oxidative stress are but one part of a suite of integrative physiological systems that interact and trade-off in complex ways, making full understanding of their ecological roles challenging.

AB  - Most butterfly monitoring protocols rely on counts along transects (Pollard walks) to generate species abundance indices and track population trends. It is still too often ignored that a population count results from two processes: the biological process (true abundance) and the statistical process (our ability to properly quantify abundance). Because individual detectability tends to vary in space (e.g., among sites) and time (e.g., among years), it remains unclear whether index counts truly reflect population sizes and trends. This study compares capture-mark-recapture (absolute abundance) and count-index (relative abundance) monitoring methods in three species (Maculinea nausithous and Iolana iolas: Lycaenidae; Minois dryas: Satyridae) in contrasted habitat types. We demonstrate that intraspecific variability in individual detectability under standard monitoring conditions is probably the rule rather than the exception, which questions the reliability of count-based indices to estimate and compare specific population abundance. Our results suggest that the accuracy of count-based methods depends heavily on the ecology and behavior of the target species, as well as on the type of habitat in which surveys take place. Monitoring programs designed to assess the abundance and trends in butterfly populations should incorporate a measure of detectability. We discuss the relative advantages and inconveniences of current monitoring methods and analytical approaches with respect to the characteristics of the species under scrutiny and resources availability.

AB  - Zooplankton community composition and diversity have been analysed for the period 1988-2007 at the coastal station L4 off Plymouth in the Western Channel. The seasonal cycle of the total zooplankton was characterized by two peaks. The total zooplankton abundance did not show any long-term trend and its interannual variations were not directly related to changes in environmental conditions. However, different periods of change in total zooplankton abundance were observed that appeared to be consistently related to changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and wind. The number of taxa (22) contributing 80-90% of the total zooplankton abundance was consistent over the 20 years and their cumulative contribution to the community showed only small interannual variations. A significant long-term increase in species richness of the copepod community was detected and its maximum annual value was significantly related to annual average SST. There was evidence of long-term changes: numbers of Oncaea spp., Cirripede larvae, Calanus helgolandicus and Chaetognaths have increased, whereas numbers of Pseudocalanus elongatus, Temora longicornis, Acartia clausi, Evadne nordmanni, Appendicularians, Podon spp. and Ctenocalanus vanus have decreased. The use of indicator species to monitor hydroclimatic changes in the Western Channel is discussed.

TI  - The relative advantages of criminal versus administrative environmental enforcement actions in Israel
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
LA  - English
AB  - Most environmental enforcement programs have separate criminal and administrative procedures for addressing violations. Pitting "criminal'' versus "administrative'' enforcement as mutually exclusive alternatives constitutes a "false dilemma''. Clearly, the government response should be influenced by the severity of pollution and the specific circumstances of the polluter. Yet, policy makers seeking to improve environmental compliance need to have a clearer picture about the merits of each approach and their relative effectiveness. This research empirically assesses the effectiveness of criminal versus administrative enforcement activities in Israel. After considering the philosophical implications associated with each regulatory approach, the results of a year-long study are presented. A series of performance indicators are utilized, with particular weight on compliance status in the field, to assess the condition of environmental violations several years subsequent to completion of enforcement activities. The state of 100 violations of air, water and hazardous materials laws that had been addressed through the criminal process were matched with results of comparable violations, against which administrative actions were taken. Results suggest that while criminal enforcement is a longer process, compliance following these actions was significantly greater than in administrative enforcement cases. The findings also underline the significance of a systematic follow-up system for tracking violations after enforcement actions are complete. Finally, the study confirms the benefits of targeted assistance to improve compliance among violators of environmental standards.

AB  - A survey, based on the use of vascular plants to describe the distribution of selected elements ( 21 in total) was performed in 11 sites in the area of Castelfiorentino ( Tuscany, Central Italy) differing for land use, from urban to industrial and rural areas. Lettuce plants grown under standardized conditions were positively used as biodeposimeters of airborne trace elements. Washing was found to be highly significant in reducing concentrations of many elements in the samples, suggesting a general surface contamination of leaves. The typical crustal element Al showed good correlations with Co, Fe, Li and V; on the contrary, Zn and Cd were intercorrelated and showed no connection with crustal indicators. Lead was still a relevant environmental presence, as the experiments were carried out before the ban of leaded gasoline. Source apportionment by factor analysis put in evidence a major contribution of crustal materials, followed by man-related activities; a minor role was ascertained for marine aerosol. A comparison was made between analytical data of lettuce plants grown in our experimental sites and a bulk of commercial lettuce purchased at a local supermarket. It should be stressed how Cu concentrations of commercial material were significantly higher than those found in our plants; this is likely caused by phytosanitary treatments.

AB  - The recovery of a soft sediment benthic invertebrate community from high levels of organic enrichment was evaluated after removal of farmed fish at an Atlantic salmon Salmo salar culture site in southeast Tasmania. Although the pattern of recovery followed established successional principles, after 36 mo neither communities under or at the edge of cages, nor communities 10 m from the edge of the cage, had attained a structure equivalent to that of the reference communities. In the first few months there was little evidence of recovery and the community was dominated by species characteristic of impacted conditions. After 12 mo the system had markedly improved, containing a diverse range of species with functional roles similar to those of the reference sites. Once the ecological function of the sediment was restored, subsequent changes in the community structure were relatively minor, simply reflecting the addition of rarer species with longer reproductive cycles and/or larval stages with a greater sensitivity to the negative effects of organic enrichment. These species may be significant where specific community changes, loss of diversity or the possibility of species extinction are the critical issues. However, restoration of system function may be a more useful indicator of generalized recovery from organic enrichment than of community equivalence.

AB  - Dendroecological techniques were applied to reconstruct stand-replacing fire history in upper montane forests in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Fourteen stand-replacing fires were dated to 8 unique fire years (18421901) using four lines of evidence at each of 12 sites within the upper Rio Grande Basin. The four lines of evidence were (i) quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) inner-ring dates, (h) fire-killed conifer bark-ring dates, (iii) tree-ring width changes or other morphological indicators of injury, and (iv) fire scars. The annual precision of dating allowed the identification of synchronous stand-replacing fire years among the sites, and co-occurrence with regional surface fire events previously reconstructed from a network of fire scar collections in lower elevation pine forests across the southwestern United States. Nearly all of the synchronous stand-replacing and surface fire years coincided with severe droughts, because climate variability created regional conditions where stand-replacing fires and surface fires burned across ecosystems. Reconstructed stand-replacing fires that predate substantial Anglo-American settlement in this region provide direct evidence that stand-replacing fires were a feature of high-elevation forests before extensive and intensive land-use practices (e.g., logging, railroad, and mining) began in the late 19th century.

AB  - In a boreal forest in southeast Norway, we evaluated the relative importance of stand-level structures versus historical data on forest age and absence of logging (at two spatial scales; stand and surrounding landscape), on the presence and abundance of the wood-rotting fungi Phellinus nigrolitnitatus and Cystostereum murraii. Both species are often considered to be indicators of long-time continuous presence of downed logs in Scandinavian forest stands.
   Of the stand-level variables, number of logs in late stages of decay was positively related to P. nigrolimitatus presence, while diversity of coarse woody debris was positively related to the abundance of the species. Both the presence and abundance of P. nigrolitnitatus was strongly and positively correlated with the area of forest uninterrupted by major disturbance the past 240 years (equalling 140 years of "old growth continuity") in the surrounding landscape (80 ha). For C murraii, consistent results was not found.
   We conclude that the causal relationships between ecological continuity and possible indicator species must be investigated on a larger scale than the stand-level as the condition of the forest surrounding a stand can have a large influence on these relationships.

KW  - AVAILABILITY
AB  - The fuelwood debate over supply-demand balances is well rehearsed; and the use of simplistic linear models to explain supply-demand differentials hardly captures the complex patterns of use and dynamics of fuelwood in the rural household. This paper shows that households in Nyando District have evolved sophisticated local response mechanisms and strategies in coping with the fuelwood scarcity. Data collected through a multi-method approach revealed, among others, a higher percentage of planted trees in Kochogo than in Awasi study sites. Despite this high proliferation of trees, rural households in Kochogo still identified fuelwood scarcity as a growing problem. The seeming 'abundance' of trees is not synonymous with the supply of fuelwood, or the alleviation of fuelwood scarcity. Rural households in Kochogo therefore resort to the market to purchase fuelwood, as well as adapt various fuel-saving strategies and mechanisms to cope with the apparent scarcity. The purchase of crop residues from the market is a strong indicator of this scarcity, being simply lack of access to or entitlement to trees. The situation is different in Awasi, where there is a higher percentage of natural trees and clump bushes, which provide a relative abundance of fuelwood. This condition has encouraged local households not to keep a stock of fuelwood, but simply to collect from nearby bushes when required. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The sodA gene from Erwinia chrysanthemi strain 3937 was cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli sodA sodB mutant and sequenced. We identified a 639bp open reading frame, which encodes a protein that is 85% identical to the E, coli manganese-containing superoxide dismutase MnSOD. Promoter elements of this gene were identified by transcriptional mapping experiments. We constructed an E. chrysanthemi Delta sodA mutant by reverse genetics. The Delta sodA mutation resulted in the absence of a cytoplasmic SOD, which displays the same characteristics as those of MnSOD. The Delta sodA mutant was more sensitive to paraquat than the wild-type strain. This mutant could macerate potato tubers, similar to the wild-type strain. In contrast, when inoculated on African violets, the mutant produced, at most, only small necrotic lesions. If the inoculum was supplemented with the superoxide anion-scavenging metalloporphyrin MnTMPyP or purified SOD and catalase, the Delta sodA mutant was able to macerate the inoculated zone. Generation of superoxide anion by African violet leaves inoculated with E. chrysanthemi was demonstrated with nitroblue tetrazolium as an indicator. Therefore, at the onset of infection, E. chrysanthemi cells encounter an oxidative environment and require active protective systems against oxidative damages such as MnSOD to overcome these types of conditions.

AB  - A multiproxy paleolimnological study of Douglas Lake, Michigan, was undertaken to elucidate the history of productivity and oxygen depletion in three basins of this multi-depression lake. Indicators investigated in three dated cores included chlorophyll a, Fe and Mn stratigraphy, and fossil chironomid assemblages. The coring sites were chosen to correspond to modern studies of oxygen depletion rates, and to determine if conclusions reached in these studies were supported by paleolimnological evidence. Stratigraphies of chlorophyll a, Fe and Mn indicate that two of the basins, South Fishtail Bay and Fairy Island, have been eutrophic and anoxic for a long period of time, predating European settlement. The third basin, Grapevine Point, has been consistently less productive, and had less severe oxygen depletion. Results of the chironomid analysis agree with these conclusions, including a change from mesotrophic to eutrophic indicator taxa in the Grapevine Point basin. All three cores show evidence of increasing trophic state in the most recent sediments, supporting some of the conclusions reached in the modern studies. It is also demonstrated that deforestation of the watershed had profound effects on littoral chironomid assemblages. Paleolimnological investigations also demonstrated the individual nature of the separate basins in Douglas Lake.

AB  - Bacterial genes are often differentially expressed in response to specific environmental conditions. We have devised a method to identify regulated bacterial promoters, such that transient promoter expression leads to a permanent and selectable change in bacterial phenotype. This system consists of a promoterless derivative of cre, the phage P1 recombinase, carried on a plasmid, and two chromosomal loxP sites, the targets of the Cre recombinase. The loxP sites flank npt, conferring kanamycin resistance, and sacB, which confers sensitivity to sucrose, allowing positive selection for both the presence and absence of this chromosomal cassette. Fusion of active promoters to cre induces recombination of the loxP sites and deletion of intervening DNA, allowing selection on media containing sucrose, while inactive promoters fail to induce recombination and so remain resistant to kanamycin. We tested the system in Salmonella typhimurium using a known regulated promoter, that from the araBAD operon, and found it to be a sensitive indicator of gene expression over a wide range of promoter induction. We then used this system to identify S. typhimurium genes that are specifically expressed when bacteria interact with cultured epithelial cells and identified a novel DNA fragment, not found in E. coli, which might represent part of a new pathogenicity island.

AB  - The impact of organic production practices on soil quality indicators, for selected farms in Nebraska and North Dakota, were evaluated to better understand their effects on soil quality and sustainability. Conventional production practices were the standard to which the effects of organic production were compared. Five organic and conventional farms, matched by soil type, were chosen for the study, Soil properties recognized as basic soil quality indicators were measured on each farm at depths of 0 to 7.6 and 0 to 30.5 cm, Averaged across locations, there was 22% more organic C (12 571 kg ha-(1)) and 20% more total N (970 kg ha(-1)) on organic farms than conventional farms in the surface 30.5 cm, At four of five locations, organic farms had soil pH closer to neutral, lower bulk density, and higher available-water holding capacity, microbial biomass C and N, and soil respiration as compared with conventional farms. Nutrient levels above crop needs were observed in both organic and conventional farms indicating the potential for negative environmental impacts. Despite this, organic farms often had more potentially mineralizable N (anaerobic incubation) relative to NO3-N in the surface 30.5 cm. For conditions of this study, the capacity of organic production practices to improve soil quality was mainly due to use of more diverse crop sequences, application of organic: amendments, and less frequent tillage.

AB  - Plant phenology is the most sensitive biological indicator that responds to climate change. Many climate models predict that extreme precipitation events will occur frequently in the arid areas of northwest China in the future, with an increase in the quantity and unpredictability of rain. Future changes in precipitation will inevitably have a profound impact on plant phenology in arid areas. A recent study has shown that after the simulated enhancement of precipitation, the end time of the leaf unfolding period of Nitraria tangutorum advanced, and the end time of leaf senescence was delayed. Under extreme climatic conditions, such as extremely dry or wet years, it is unclear whether the influence of the simulated enhancement of precipitation on the phenology of N. tangutorum remains stable. To solve this problem, this study systematically analyzed the effects of the simulated enhancement of precipitation on the start, end and duration of four phenological events of N. tangutorum, including leaf budding, leaf unfolding, leaf senescence and leaf fall under extremely dry and wet conditions. The aim of this study was to clarify the similarities and differences of the effects of the simulated enhancement of precipitation on the start, end and duration of each phenological period of N. tangutorum in an extremely dry and an extremely wet year to reveal the regulatory effect of extremely dry and excessive amounts of precipitation on the phenology of N. tangutorum. (1) After the simulated enhancement of precipitation, the start and end times of the spring phenology (leaf budding and leaf unfolding) of N. tangutorum advanced during an extremely dry and an extremely wet year, but the duration of phenology was shortened during an extremely wet year and prolonged during an extremely drought-stricken year. The amplitude of variation increased with the increase in simulated precipitation. (2) After the simulated enhancement of precipitation, the start and end times of the phenology (leaf senescence and leaf fall) of N. tangutorum during the autumn advanced in an extremely wet year but was delayed during an extremely dry year, and the duration of phenology was prolonged in both extremely dry and wet years. The amplitude of variation increased with the increase in simulated precipitation. (3) The regulation mechanism of extremely dry or wet years on the spring phenology of N. tangutorum lay in the different degree of influence on the start and end times of leaf budding and leaf unfolding. However, the regulation mechanism of extremely dry or wet years on the autumn phenology of N. tangutorum lay in different reasons. Water stress caused by excessive water forced N. tangutorum to start its leaf senescence early during an extremely wet year. In contrast, the alleviation of drought stress after watering during the senescence of N. tangutorum caused a delay in the autumn phenology during an extremely dry year.

AB  - The record of fossil mammals from the Shungura Formation, lower Omo Valley of southern Ethiopia, represents one of the largest and most carefully controlled samples for deciphering the responses of land faunas to global-scale climatic change. We use the abundant and continuous fossil record of the family Bovidae to analyze the effects of a late Pliocene climatic shift toward increased aridity in Africa beginning at 2.8 Ma and intensifying at about 2.4 Ma. A database consisting of 4233 specimen-based records collected under well-defined procedures is used to define patterns through time in bovid abundances while also controlling for taphonomic and other potential biases. Univariate and multidimensional (correspondence analysis) methods are used to study changes in bovid abundances through time. Our results indicate that bovids experienced an increase in species richness and a rapid episode of change in taxonomic abundances at 2.8 +/- 0.1 Ma (between Members B and C), and that this shift was followed by gradual and prolonged changes in abundance between 2.8 and 2.0 Ma (between Member C and upper Member G). An analysis of skeletal-element abundances through the Shungura sequence shows that only moderate changes in taphonomic conditions occurred between 3.0 and 2.1 Ma, when the lower Omo Valley was dominated by a large, meandering river, but that significant changes in the mode of preservation accompanied the onset of lacustrine depositional environments at 2.1 Ma (between lower and upper Member G). A juxtaposition of taxonomic with taphonomic patterns shows that the shift in taxonomic abundances at 2.8 Ma occurred in the absence of significant changes in taphonomic conditions. The main changes in bovid relative abundances and diversity appear to have been driven by broad environmental and climatic changes in Africa. As environmental indicators, bovids show a transition in the Omo at about 2.8 Ma from closed and wet environments in Member B to closed but dry environments in Member C. This drying trend intensified in Members D, E, and F, between about 2.5 and 2.3 Ma. In lower Member G, between 2.3 and 2.1 Ma, there was an increase in bovid abundance and diversity, which may be a result of greater environmental heterogeneity. The pattern of environmental change depicted by Shungura bovids is consistent with independently derived evidence of Omo paleoenvironments (from paleosols, paleoflora, and micromammals), and with regional and global evidence of climatic changes, especially acute between 2.8 and 2.3 Ma, that caused the initiation of glacial cycles in the north and drier climate in the tropics of Africa. Even though the Omo bovids showed distinct responses to large-scale climatic and environmental change, the Omo bovid community also had important attributes of long-term stability: two species, Aepyceros shungurae and Tragelaphus nakuae, dominated the community for nearly one million years. This study highlights the importance of carefully controlled collection procedures of fossil vertebrates and provides an important demonstration of the potential complexity in mode and rate of responses of land faunas to climatic change.

AB  - In the Teruel Graben (northeast Spain), laminar and nodular calcretes formed in a variety of Cenozoic deposits, ranging in age from Palaeogene to Pleistocene. These calcretes developed in a relatively small area under the influence of the same highlands. Consequently differences in their microstructure and isotopic composition (C and 0) must be related to differences in host rock, climate, vegetation and duration of development. Nine profiles developed in different sedimentary settings, from proximal areas to lacustrine environments, were studied to determine whether the microstructure and stable isotope composition changed during the Cenozoic. These characteristics might be used as indicators of the prevailing climate and vegetation. and reveal any changes that occurred during this time.
   Most of the laminar calcretes studied are compound profiles that formed on hard substrates (e.g., Jurassic limestones) or coarse detrital deposits (e.g., Palaeogene, Pliocene and Plio-Pleistocene sandstones and conglomerates). These profiles formed in proximal areas of the basin and also in fluvial terraces. Microstructures include biogenic features such as alveolar septal structures. root tubes, calcified root cells and calcified organic filaments. Underside coatings of micrite and fibrous vadose cements are common around gravel clasts. On the other side, spherulites are only preserved at the very top of the youngest calcretes. Nodular calcretes developed on fine detrital substrates (e.g., on Palaeogene, Miocene and Pliocene red mudstones and sandy mudstones of distal alluvial and floodplain environments), and in some places grade vertically into palustrine limestones. The nodules consist of micrite and were elongated vertically, show desiccation cracks and mottling, micritic coatings, some alveolar septal structures, and root traces. Microcodium of type 1 occurs in both laminar and nodular calcretes, but only in those of Palaeogene age, while calcified root cells (Microcodium of type 3) are seen in the Pliocene calcretes.
   The stable isotope composition covers a wide range: -8.23<delta(18)O<-4.29parts per thousand PDB and -7.29<delta(13)C<-3.42parts per thousand PDB. Nodular. laminar and palustrine facies occupy overlapped isotopic fields, displaying an overall negative covariant trend. Location within the basin, prevailing climate and density of vegetation are responsible for differences in isotope values. The Palaeogene samples show a wide range of values and are difficult to separate from the others; however, there is as significant change to lighter carbon values from the Miocene to the Pliocene profiles. This change may be related to the cooler climatic conditions that prevailed during the Pliocene and is reverse to the expected shift to heavier delta(13)C values, which is related to the increase of C-4 vegetation, that occurred in many areas of the world during the Miocene or to the transit to the Pliocene. The formation of these calcretes seems to have occurred in semi-arid conditions with prevailing C-3 vegetation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In degraded agricultural soils, organic C levels can be increased and conserved by adopting alternative management strategies such as no-tillage and increased cropping intensity. However, soil microbial community responses to increased soil organic C (SOC) may be constrained due to water limitations in semi-arid dryland agroecosystems. The purpose of this study was to assess SOC, microbial biomass C (MBC) and community ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) composition under winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in no-till systems of wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow (WCF), wheat-wheat-corn-millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) (WWCM), wheat-corn-millet (WCM), opportunity cropping (OPP), and perennial grass across a potential evapotranspiration gradient in eastern Colorado. Rotations of VVWCM and OPP, in which crops are chosen based on available soil water at the time of planting rather than according to a predetermined rotation schedule, increased levels of SOC to those measured under perennial grass. However, MBC under OPP cropping accounted for the smallest fraction (2.0-3.6%) of SOC compared to other systems, in which MBC ranged from 2.4 to 6.3% of SOC. Microbial community structure was most divergent between OPP-cropped and perennial grass soils, whereas few differences were observed among microbial communities of the WCF, WCM, and WWCM rotations. Compared to perennial grass and other cropping systems, microbial biomass in OPP-cropped soil was low and contained less of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomarker 16:1 omega 5c. Microbial stress, as indicated by the ratio of 17:0 cy to 16:1 omega 7c, was greatest under OPP and WCF cropping. In contrast, soils under perennial grass contained lower ratios of bacterial: fungal EL-FAMEs and higher levels of MBC, ratios of MBC:SOC, and relative abundances of 16:1 omega 5c. Across locations, SOC and moisture content increased as soil texture became finer, whereas trends in MBC and community structure followed the potential evapotranspiration gradient. Soil from the high potential evapotranspiration site contained the lowest level of MBC but greater relative amounts of 16:1 omega 5c and lower ratios of stress indicator and bacterial: fungal EL-FAMEs compared to soil located at the moderate and low potential evapotranspiration sites. Indistinct microbial communities under WCF, WCM, and WWCM could be explained by EL-FAME limitations to detecting slight differences in microbial community structure or to the overwhelming response of microbial communities to environmental rather than management conditions. Further research is needed to assess potential legacy effects of long-term agricultural management that may mask microbial responses to recent management change, as well as to identify conditions that lead to high microbial community resiliency in response to management so that communities are similar under a given crop despite different preceding crops.

AB  - Soil and plant samples from roadside areas contaminated with toxic by-products of vehicular traffic (for example, lead compounds from leaded fuel, metal contaminants derived from spare parts) were analysed in the case of five Hungarian sampling sites. The analyses were carried out with a new analytical method which is based on the use of a high performance sample introduction unit in the conventional ICP spectrometry. By using this system, significantly lower detection limits were obtained related to the conventional ICP-AES method. The analysis results showed a close correlation between the daily mean volume of traffic and metals accumulated in the soil samples. On the other hand, using this method similar heavy metal profiles were gained, ie. the total and plant-available heavy metal concentrations were the highest in the 0-1 m region from the road, and the further sampling points (0-90 m) showed significantly lower and lower heavy metal contents until at about 90 m distance from the road, where heavy metal contamination reached such a low value that can be considered to be the environmental background level. A similar trend was also recognised in plants; the plants very near to the road surface accumulated very high amounts of lead, cadmium and other heavy metals derived from vehicular traffic. The results revealed different behaviours of contaminants in different conditions inside the roadside areas (soil pH and heavy metal content, species and abundance of flora at the different sampling points, etc.). For example, total and available concentrations were apparently low only in one sampling site where each sampling point of the cross-section showed acid soil medium. Generally, acid pH means higher mobility of heavy metals, which was verified in our study too, as low concentrations in soil are associated with high accumulation factors in plants. Both single-and two-factor ANOVA results showed that total and available lead contents were not significantly different between sampling sites, therefore they were considered as traffic as the main contaminating source produced near the same lead content in different conditions. Single-factor ANOVAs showed significant differences, meanwhile two-factor ANOVAs did not show significant differences among mean lead contents detected in plants sampled in the five sites. These different results for lead showed that with the increase of variables (from one to two factors) the mathematical differences between lead contents became less and less significant. It calls for paying attention to the evaluation of bioindication and requires use of all the available variables in order to gain precise results from sampled areas. Some plants such as Echinocloa crus-galli, Clematis recta, Artemisia vulgaris, Crepis biennis, Portulaca oleracea and Lathyrus pratensis were found to be good indicators, as they accumulated three or four different heavy metals in high concentrations. in addition to their sensitive indicating ability, the majority of these plants are weeds of cereals in arable lands, and so are easily available in roadside areas.

AB  - In continental subduction complexes minor volumes of high-pressure mafic rocks (eclogites) often co-exist with much more abundant felsic (granitic) and metasedimentary rocks, which are vital for resolving the origin and metamorphic evolution of subducted continental crust. In SW Mongolia, the Alag Khadny eclogite-bearing accretionary complex (AKC) is assumed to represent either a remnant of oceanic slab, or a continental margin, subducted in the Early Cambrian. Here we present geochronological, geochemical and petrological evidence of subduction records for the three major types of lithologies that host mafic eclogites, including Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic granitic basement and overlying Neoproterozoic continental-margin sediments. Variably deformed, ferroan and peraluminous metagranitoids compose a major part of AKC and are interlayered with eclogites in its southern and eastern margins. They have geochemical features of post-collisional/intraplate high-K calc-alkaline granites. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon geochronology of three distinct metagranite samples show uniform protolith crystallization ages of ca. 0.96 Ga and uncertain re-crystallization in the Late Neoproterozoic or Early Paleozoic metamorphic event, whereas abundant zircon inheritance indicates older, Mesoproterozoic to Paleoproterozoic crustal substrate during granite generation. The existence of Mesoproterozoic crust is highlighted by finding of distinct metagranitoids with the U-Pb zircon crystallization age of ca. 1.6 Ga. Hafnium isotope signatures (T-DM(C) 2.88-1.85 Ga) of zircons from all lithologies preserved the evidence of reworked Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic crust, similar to that of the Baidrag block (southern Mongolia), for both Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic rocks. Regardless of the specific lithology, the rocks display indicators of high-pressure metamorphic re-equilibration, including garnet (X-Ca up to 0.65) + epidote + phengite (Si p.f.u. up to 3.56) +/- rutile assemblage in metagranitoids, garnet + phengite (Si p.f.u. up to 3.42) in quartz-rich semi-pelites and garnet + phengite (Si p.f.u. up to 3.39) + medium-Mg chloritoid (X-Mg up to 0.25)+ kyanite + rutile in metapelites. Corresponding P-T conditions recovered from different lithologies reveal incoherent subduction of rocks, which could be shallow for granitic basement (1.1-1.4 GPa and 600-670 degrees C) and clastic metasediments (1.4-1.6 GPa, 570-620 degrees C), but deeper for metapelites (2.1-2.3 GPa, 500-570 degrees C). consistent with that of eclogites, The combined data show that the Alag Khadny complex represents a remnant of a rifted Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic (ca. 1.6-0.96 Ga) continental margin consequently metamorphosed under HP conditions during Late Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian evolution of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Acquired P-T estimates imply that high-pressure metagranitoids and metasedimentary rocks equilibrated at different depths, but most likely shared a common subduction-related metamorphic evolution.

AB  - Light absorption and light extinction can importantly affect crop growth and yield production. Accordingly, two field (split plot) experiments were conducted to investigate: 1) the most optimum plant spacing (S) and density (D), which result in the highest rate of corn yield and yield components as affected by light absorption (L) and extinction (K), 2) the most efficient corn genotype (G) and the most optimum N fertilization rate (N), which effectively increase corn yield and yield components by affecting corn light properties. D and N were devoted to the main plots and S and G were used as the sub treatments. Light absorption was measured using a light meter and the coefficients of light extinction (K) were calculated. D, N and G as well as their interactions were the most effective factors on corn light properties, growth and yield. The crop density of 10-12 significantly affected corn growth and yield production. D12 resulted in the highest LAI (4.40), L (16.00%), and biological yields (20,623.8 kg/ha). However, the highest K (0.79), grain yield (2398.8 kg/ha), and harvest index (14.36) were related to D6. Although plant height increased up to S60 (234.8 cm) (P = 0.05), the highest and significantly different LAI was resulted by S50 (4.20). S60 also resulted in the highest L (20.91%). Increasing S also increased kappa according to the following: S50 (0.69), S60 (0.80), and S75 (0.93). Elevating N significantly increased (P = 0.05) cob length and LAI at N100 (15.39 cm, 6.574) and N150 (15.72 cm, 6.512). The highest L, (28.58%, P = 0.1), K (0.51), biological (16,230.1) and grain (3623 kg/ha) yields as well as harvest index (22.33) were resulted by N100. Genotype SC704 resulted in the highest LAI (6.381), L (22.80%), K (0.49), and grain yield (3501 kg/ha). Although with increasing D, corn leaf area index (LAI) and L increased, K decreased, which may be used as an indicator of light efficiency utilized by crop. Such results indicate that measurement of K is also essential for the proper determination of corn plant response to light. The most optimum N treatment was 100 kg/ha and the most efficient G was SC704. D, N and G are among the most important factors affecting corn light properties, growth and yield, compared with S. It is strongly suggested that such experiments be conducted under different climatic conditions to indicate the significance of the experimental treatments on corn light properties, growth and yield. The results of these experiments can be used for the proper designing of corn plantation resulting in the highest rate of efficiency with respect to the available resources and the present climatic conditions.

AB  - Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of tooth enamel carbonate were collected from both fossils (50-100 ka) Tammar Wallaby (Macropus eugeneii) and Western Grey Kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) from a Late Pleistocene fossil deposit situated on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. delta C-13 and delta O-18 data were also obtained for modern equivalents of both species located proximal to the excavation site. Trace element compositions were collected for Sr, Ba, V. Cu, Zr, Y, La, Ca, Nd, and U for modern and fossil teeth, and for local soils. delta C-13 data for fossil kangaroo and wallaby range between -5.0 and -18 parts per thousand, while less C-13 enriched values between -18 and -25 parts per thousand are observed in modern tooth enamel. Early-formed molars are C-13 depleted by similar to 2.5 parts per thousand compared to late-formed molars, consistent with isotopic offsets observed in modern molars, and with offsets observed from preservation of original biogenic compositions. Overall, carbon isotopes indicate a shift in diet and environmental conditions from C4-inclusive mixed habitats (woods and open grasslands) during the Late Pleistocene, to C3-only wooded and closed canopy habitats today, delta O-18 values range between 23 and 30 parts per thousand and are indistinguishable for fossil and modern tooth enamel. Oxygen isotope compositions of plants and mammals correlate positively with local water compositions, and negatively with relative humidity. Thus, the lack of oxygen isotope differences for the Late Pleistocene vs. modern day teeth may be attributed to combined lower temperatures (decreasing local water delta O-18) plus decreased relative humidity (increasing plant and mammal delta O-18) in the Late Pleistocene. Trace element data from fossil and modern teeth and from fossil deposit sedimentary material indicate post burial chemical alteration. Excepting Ba and possibly Cu, concentrations of all other elements analysed (Sr, V, Zr, Y, la, Ce, Nd, and U) increased significantly relative to modern teeth (over an order of magnitude shift, with p <= 0.01 for t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests). This diagenetic process may have occurred during the last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a period of localised wet conditions when significant amounts of soluble soil organic matter accumulated at the fossil site. Trace element analysis of local soils indicates that, relative to soils, teeth strongly prefer Stand U [K-D(fossil tooth/soil) similar to 10], and exclude Zr, Cu, and possibly V and Ba [K-D <= 0.5]. Surprisingly, Rare Earth Elements (REEs) indicate K-D values of similar to 1. These data imply that Ba is a poor indicator of chemical alteration, while Sr. U, Zr. V, Y. and REEs are particularly sensitive to alteration. Comparisons with other palaeoclimate data suggest that the environmental change on Kangaroo Island from Late Pleistocene to present was greater than on the Nullarbor Plain. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mineral dust is an important constituent of the solid load in Earth's atmosphere, the total atmospheric aerosol loading being both a function of, and a factor affecting climatic change. Human actions have progressively enhanced atmospheric dust loading, especially in the past century, so that both natural and human-induced effects of atmospheric dust on climatic change require more detailed research. Records of changing climate are preserved in cores from the ocean floors, glaciers and ice sheets, as well as in terrestrial sedimentary sections. Quantitative data on the present-day distribution of atmospheric dust are sparse, but simulation of dust transport and deposition has been modelled with some success. The dust indicators and records of terrestrial and marine palaeoenvironments (DIRTMAP) database was designed to serve as a global validation data set for use with earth system models of the palaeo-dust cycle. Loess, a wind-borne silt deposited on the continents particularly in the past 2.6 Myr, is an important potential source of information on past atmospheric dust accumulation. A recent initiative sought to improve the terrestrial data coverage within the existing DIRTMAP database by involving representatives from key loess regions in coordinating the data synthesis process, so as to facilitate interaction between the dust modelling and the data collection communities. The results are presented in this issue. In order to compare past minerogenic dust records (loess) with those in ice and ocean cores, mass accumulation rates (MARS) have been calculated as fluxes (in g/m(2)/yr). The loess regions covered include North and South America, Europe, Siberia, eastern Asia. and Australasia. It is acknowledged that provision of age models for the calculation of realistic MAR values depends upon a number of conditions, most notably sound chronostratigraphy and realistic values of loess dry bulk densities. The MAR data sets presented here show some notable variation, both within and between the studied regions. Regional MAR coverage also varies, reflecting differences in the availability of key data on loess from one world region to another. Loess facies vary according to specific site and source conditions, as well as in response to post-depositional re-working of primary (wind-lain) loess by surface geomorphic processes. Mean particle size consistently declines downwind, and terrace, valley and upland sites generally yield the highest MAR values, characteristics noted in all regions discussed here. The loess accumulations in two major world regions, central and eastern Asia and the Great Plains region of North America, differ in some important respects from loess elsewhere in that they lie peripheral to deserts and are remote from the former sites of major Quaternary ice sheets. It is concluded that the MARs for terrestrial sites obtained from loess are consistently higher than those obtained from ocean and ice cores, so that future climatic models designed to study the role of global atmospheric dust will have to take full account of the present and past dust records over the continents.

AB  - The concept of stratigraphic base level, or the ratio between accommodation and sediment supply (A/S ratio), has been used to analyse the Rusty and Canyon Creek Members of the Campanian Ericson Sandstone in the Rock Springs Uplift, SW Wyoming, USA. The Ericson Sandstone was deposited under fluvial to estuarine conditions in a foreland basin setting influenced both by Sevier-style (thrust belt) tectonism and by more local, Laramide-style, foreland uplifts. The depositional setting was situated several tens to a few hundred kilometres from the nearest shoreline. Therefore, sea level change at the contemporaneous shoreline probably had little, if any, influence on the development of the sedimentary architecture.
   The Rusty Member shows an alternation between incised valleys filled by multi-storey estuarine channel sandstones showing palaeoflow to the south and delta plain sediments with single-storey channels with no evidence of tidal influence, which show palaeoflow to the east. This cyclicity is interpreted as recording repeated uplift of the Wind River Range to the north, causing valley incision and reduction of the A/S ratio. During quiescent periods, the A/S ratio increased allowing the valleys to fill and delta plain conditions to be subsequently re-established because of increased sediment supply ham the thrust belt in the west.
   A regional unconformity at the base of the Canyon Creek Member truncates the Rusty Member, and represents a significant reduction of the A/S ratio caused by Laramide tectonia: uplift. The Canyon Creek Member is a multistorey, multi-lateral fluvial channel sandstone, where channel preservation and thickness increase upwards, suggesting an increase of the A/S ratio. The Canyon Creek Member channels are interpreted to have been sinuous, meandering channels from the observed sedimentary structures and fill patterns, despite their sand-rich nature. It is argued that grain size is a poor indicator of channel planform, and that there was very law preservation potential for fine material because of a relatively low A/S ratio.
   The top of the Canyon Creek Member is a regionally correlative surface marking an abrupt increase of the A/S ratio. This surface is termed an expansion surface, denoting an abrupt increase in accommodation. The overlying Almond Formation shows a single-storey alluvial architecture with a very high preservation of fine-grained material. An assumed correspondence in time of the Late Absaroka thrust phase in the Sevier belt to the west and the formation of the sharp top of the Canyon Creek Member suggests that the thrust phase caused a basin-wide abrupt increase of subsidence that changed the alluvial architecture.
   As an alternative to sequence stratigraphic: nomenclature defined for strata controlled by shoreline movements, a scheme relating systems tracts and surfaces to changes in stratigraphic base level is proposed. Such a scheme is useful where correlations to shoreline strata are ambiguous or cannot be made, or where tectonics and climate are important controls.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the paper is investigation of the development of the Ukrainian market of insurance products in agriculture with the identification and classification of factors that affect the dynamics of the main market indicators, and determination on this basis the conceptual directions of building an effective system of agricultural insurance in Ukraine.
   Methodology / method / approach. The methodology of the study consisted of the provisions of neoclassical and institutional theories; we used methods of generalization and systematization (by determining current trends in the development of the agricultural insurance market), periodization (to identify common features and differences in the formation of agricultural insurance in Ukraine), statistical analysis (to analyze the dynamics of agricultural development indicators, the agricultural insurance market), factor analysis (to determine the factors influencing the effectiveness of agricultural insurance); correlation and regression analyzes (by revealing dependence of development indicators of agricultural insurance market from macroeconomic indicators and volumes of state financing), prognostic (to formulate conclusions and proposals on conceptual vectors of development of agricultural insurance).
   Results. The study revealed a low level of penetration (implementation) of insurance in the agriculture of Ukraine. Agri-insurance is carried out mainly in crop production. Modern insurance products are presented in the Ukrainian insurance market, but their range is smaller than in the countries with developed agricultural insurance. Regulatory provision of insurance for agricultural products is represented by a large number of documents, the failure of which in full compliance with certain provisions, such as state subsidies for insurance premiums, impedes the development of agricultural insurance. We summarized and classified the factors of development of agricultural insurance in Ukraine and used a mathematical model to identify the main functional factors that influence the dynamics of insured areas. We established an important dependence of the development of agricultural insurance on a set of institutional and functional factors.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The systematic approach to the research of agricultural insurance as a constituent of conditions for sustainable development of the agrarian sphere was further developed. It is determined that implementation of potential opportunities of agricultural insurance as a component of ensuring conditions for sustainable development of the agrarian sector is hampered by the high cost of insurance premiums, insufficient amounts of financing of state programs, inconsistency of state policy, absence in its development and implementation of medium-term planning; incompleteness of information on the part of stakeholders regarding the necessity, availability of agricultural insurance. For the development of agricultural insurance, it is necessary to reduce the negative impact of such factors.
   Practical value / significance. The institutionalization of agricultural insurance, as one of the preconditions for the functioning of Ukrainian agriculture on the principles of sustainable development, will facilitate the transition from multi-risk to index insurance, the formation of a transparent regulatory environment, the introduction of medium-term state programming, the dissemination of information on the necessity, availability, expediency of agricultural insurance at the state level for the stakeholder.

AB  - Very fragile sandy soils have high erosion susceptibility, low water retention, and low nutrient and carbon storage. In southern Brazil, substitution of native grassland by grain, production in conventional tillage has caused severe degradation, even reaching an extreme state of "sandyzation" or non-vegetated sand. We measured indicators to assess soil quality in a Quartzipsamment ("Neossolo Quartzarenico") under different uses and also in extreme state of "sandyzation" or non-vegetated sand, where annual average rainfall is 1511 mm with regular distribution throughout the year. Four land uses/conditions were evaluated: (i) native grassland (NG) (4% clay); (ii) nine years-old eucalyptus forest (EF) (4% clay); (iii) corn production in conventional tillage (CT) (3% clay); and (iv) extreme state of "sandyzation"- or non vegetated sand (NVS) (2% clay). Measured soil chemical properties were soil organic carbon (SOC) in 0-2.5, 2.5-5, 5-7.5, 7.5-10 and 10-20 cm soil layers, Ca, Mg, K, Al saturation, and effective cation exchange capacity (CEC) in 0-2.5 cm layer. Measured soil physical properties were soil bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), macroporosity (Macro), microporosity (Micro), water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) in 0-3, 5-8, and 10-13 cm soil layers, whereas aggregate stability in, water was measured in 0-5 cm soil layer. Soil chemical and physical properties indicate an extreme state of degradation of NVS, which had significantly lowest SOC and thus low CEC, associated to leaching of exchangeable bases and high aluminum saturation. CT also provided a significant decrease in SOC in all soil layers, and other in chemical properties in the 0-2.5 cm layer, whilst EF was the most efficient system to build up SOC compared to NG in surface layers (0-2.5 and 2.5-5 cm) and presented better chemical conditions. In general, soil physical quality was degraded in NVS and improved in EF, whilst there were no significant differences in CT compared to NG for most soil physical properties. Soil physical properties were closely related to surface SOC of the different land uses. NVS provided a significant decrease in Micro, whilst EF provided a significant increase in TP and. Macro in 0-3 and 5-8 cm soil layers. High TP and Macro, low Micro, and very high Ks were observed in NVS. The CT provided significant decrease in water aggregate stability compared to NG and the water aggregate stability rank was EF > NG > CT, whereas NVS soil was completely devoid of aggregation. NVS restricts plant growth, root development, plant nutrient uptake and soil cover, thus creating an environment prone to wind erosion and soil degradation. Management practices that include permanent soil cover, restore SOC, improve soil aggregation and create pores for water retention and availability, increase base saturation and promote nutrient cycling are necessary to preserve these fragile lands.

KW  - PATHOLOGY
AB  - Oral health is an important indicator of general or systemic health. On the other hand, it is well known that oral health is also affected by social, economic, and ecological factors. Thus oral health status and its indicators may be reflected in the condition of a skeletal population. In this study oral health indicators of human skeletons dated to the Middle Byzantine period and unearthed from the Tlos excavations were investigated and sought to answer two specific questions. The preliminary anthropological observations on this skeletal material has already revealed that the population of Tlos was relatively healthy. The answer to the first question is whether it is coincident with the overall health profile to oral health indicators. The second question relates to the prosperity and economic growth that occurred in Byzantine society from 900 to 1200 A.D. and whether this can be traced on the human skeleton.
   The permanent teeth, their sockets, and jaw fragments of fifty-two human skeletal remains unearthed from Great Bath of Tlos excavation were examined odontologically and paleopatho-logically. The skeletal material was dated to the 11th and 12th centuries A.D. according to archaeological findings. The analyses included dental caries, abscess, dental wear, dental calculus, hypoplasia, and number of missing teeth (ante-mortem).
   Our analysis showed that the uncorrected rate of decay for permanent teeth was 8.9% (72/809) and that more than half of the dental caries (55.6%) occur in inter-proximal areas of teeth. A total of 818 teeth and alveolar regions of these teeth were examined in terms of abscess, and a total of nine abscesses (periapical osteitis) were detected. Thus the proportion of this lesion for the community was calculated as 1.1%. The rate of ante-mortem tooth loss (AMTL) among was 7.3%. When all teeth are taken into consideration, the teeth missing most were the first molars. The rate of AMTL among the anterior teeth is obviously low. In 21.9% of the teeth examined, the formation of dental calculus was observed. And as expected, the accumulation in the anterior teeth was greater than those of posterior ones: 41% of the central incisors and 34% of the lateral incisors had tartar. Tooth wear was determined by the technique developed by Smith (1984) for incisors, canines, and premolars, and the scale generated by Scott (1979) for molars. The average wear rate for all teeth examined was found to be 3.05. Hypoplasic lesions were encountered in 37.6% of the teeth observed.
   The oral health indicators of the Tlos skeletons were compared with other skeletal series dated to the Byzantine period. The comparisons showed that the residents of Tlos were relatively "healthy" in terms of oral health indicators. For example, tooth decay, AMTL, abscess, and tartar were observed to be lower than the compared populations. These findings are in line with previous observations derived from the cranial and post-cranial skeletons of Tlos. In conclusion, the prosperity and socioeconomic conditions of the Middle Byzantine period also played a role in reaching this "healthy" status.

KW  - VEGETABLE CROPS
KW  - CENTRAL POLAND
AB  - In Poland, irrigation of plants cultivated in field has been not developed yet on a larger scale mainly due to unfavorable economic conditions and infrastructure. An increase of irrigated area is still prospective, and is a major standby of agricultural production. Factors accelerating the development of irrigation next to providing higher and stable yields of good quality are a need for competitiveness and modernity in farms as well as the projected climate changes.
   Main indicators of the purpose of irrigation are the effects of production; it means absolute increases in yields obtained under the influence of this treatment in agricultural production technology. Quantity and value of the effects of irrigation production can be analyzed in terms of the average (mean years) or in relation to a particular growing season. In the first case, the effects depend primarily on the criterion of the soil, and the secondly on the meteorological conditions, particularly the amount and distribution of rainfall.
   The cognitive aim of this study was finding a significant correlation between the amounts of the production effects under irrigation and selected indicators of meteorological and agricultural drought during periods of increased water needs for tested plants. The utility goal was to propose a forecast method of application of these results based on a temporal and spatial variability of these indicators.
   The research was accomplished on the basis of long-term, field experiments with irrigation of following crops: table potatoes, malting barley, beans and corn harvested for grain. The experiments were conducted in the years 2006-2012 at the Research Station of University of Technology and Life Sciences in Mochelek, located nearby Bydgoszcz on Luvisols, grouped to the class IVa and very good rye complex of valuation on agricultural suitability. The tested crops were optimally irrigated in periods of agricultural droughts, and were guaranteed by moisture content in a layer of soil with a controlled water supply readily available to plants over the whole period of increased water needs.
   In the seven-year research period the production effects of irrigation for the certain crops were characterized by very high temporal variability. For example, for malting barley the effects amounted to an average of 1.44 t.ha(-1), varying from 0 (in the year 2009) to 3.39 t.ha(-1). These effects authors subordinate to selected indicators of meteorological and agricultural droughts during periods of increased water needs for the studied crops: rainfall (P), standardized precipitation index (SPI), the relative rate of precipitation (RPI), climatic water balance (KBW) and agricultural-climatic water balance (RKBW). In all cases, authors obtained significant relationships between the compared data which lead to a determination of variability of production effects with irrigation in the region of Bydgoszcz in different growing seasons (temporal variability), and allowed to predict the effects of irrigation plants in a distinct Polish rainfall zones (spatial variability). Compilation of the variability of production effects of irrigation in field crops is the basis for the analysis of the purpose of the treatment, both in terms of environmental criteria, as well as economic.

AB  - One of the leading roles in treating diabetes mellitus belongs to chrome ions therapy (III), especially in the complex with selenium (IV). Currently selenium is obtained from unicellular algae, which contain biologically active substances and which are capable of accumulating exogenous microelements. By incubating unicellular algae Chlorella vulgaris Biej. in the conditions of aquaculture with sodium selenite (IV) and chromium (III) chloride, we obtained a biologically active lipid substance which contains selenium and chromium. The substance was tested for the impact on energy metabolism of animals exposed to experimentally induced diabetes mellitus. The diabetes was caused by modeling obesity of the animals with further injection of streptozotocin in the amount of 65 mg/kg and nicotinamide at the dose of 230 mg/kg. The rats were intragastrically injected with 1 ml of 1% starch solution which contained a selenium-chromelipid complex extracted from the Chlorella containing 0.6 ae g of selenium, 1.05 ae g of chrome and 0.5 mg of lipids for prophylactic, therapeutic and prophylactic-therapeutic purposes; the other group of rats for therapeutic purposes was injected with starch solution with the same composition of microelements in inorganic form -sodium selenite (IV) and chromium chloride (III). This paper presents the results of our study of the impact of organic and inorganic compounds of chrome and selenium on the energetic metabolism of rats exposed to experimental diabetes mellitus. The analysis determined that in the rats' organism, the selenium-chrome-lipid complex from the Chlorella improved the indicators of the energetic metabolism -in the group of rats which received it for therapeutic purposes, we observed an up to 7.5 fold increase in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase compared to the rats which did not receive therapeutic treatment. The increase in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase corresponded to the increase in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase to 17.2% -in the group of rats injected with the substance for therapeutic purposes. Also, the selenium-chromelipid complex activated NADPH-glutamatedehydrogenase in groups of rats which received it for prophylactic and therapeutic-prophylactic purposes. A decrease in NADPH-GDH was observed in all groups of rats which were injected with the Chlorella complex, and its activation was observed only in the group of rats injected with inorganic forms of selenium and chrome. In rats injected with the Chlorella complex, we observed change in the ratio of NAD and NADPH-GDH towards increase. This indicates the intensification of the energy metabolism in the animals' liver by using aminoacids as energetic substances. In the conditions of injecting inorganic forms of selenium and chrome, the ratio of NAD/NADPH decreased. Therefore, the results allow us to consider the algal complex obtained from Chlorella to be effective for regulating the energetic metabolism of subjects suffering from diabetis mellitus compared to the use of inorganic forms of chrome and selenium.

AB  - In this study, PM2.5 samples collected between October 29 and December 23, 2018 at a roadway site in Gwangju, Korea, were comprehensively characterized by chemical, optical, and spectroscopic methods. Aerosol light absorption was observed with a time resolution of 1 min using a dual-spot aethalometer. An Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy analysis was also applied to characterize organic and inorganic components in the PM2.5 samples. Three PM2.5 pollution episodes which exceeded the 24hr Korean PM2.5 standard (35 mu g/m3) were classified; Episode I was associated with local air stagnation and longrange transportation of aerosol particles from northeast China and upwind regions; Episode II was affected by Asian dust (AD) particles and local pollution under low relative humidity (RH) conditions; and Episode III was strongly associated with accumulation of local pollution due to very high RH and low wind speed, along with regional transport of aerosol particles from eastern China. The contribution of organic aerosols to PM2.5 was higher during episodes I and II than during episode III, while the contribution of NO3- particles was greater during episode III, possibly due to very high RH and low wind speed conditions. Unexpectedly, SO42- was not an important component of PM2.5 during the three episodes. The light absorption coefficient (bBrC,370) of brown carbon (BrC) at 370 nm was estimated to range from 9 Mm-1 during episode II to 14 Mm-1 during episode III, but the contribution of bBrC,370 to total aerosol absorption was the lowest during episode III. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the contributions of the traffic emissions, biomass burning (BB) emissions, and secondary formation processes to bBrC,370 absorption were, on average, 37, 39, and 14% of the total estimated bBrC,370, respectively, suggesting that primary traffic emissions are an important contributor to BrC absorption at the roadway site. ATR-FTIR analysis showed that aliphatic carbon group (C-H), carbonyl group (C--O), ammonium, sulfate, and nitrate were identified in all filter samples collected during the three pollution episodes; the corresponding bands had the highest intensities in the filter sample from episode III. However, the presence of mineral dusts related to hydroxyl group (-OH), gypsum, Al-Al-OH group, CO32-, and SO32- were clearly detected at the absorbance bands at 3400-3700 and 650-900 cm- 1 in the AD sample only (episode II). Furthermore, the absorbance bands observed at 2910 and 2850 cm- 1 during the pollution episodes were assigned to methylene groups (-CH2-), which are associated with BB emissions, and the intensities of those bands during pollution episodes were consistent with the concentrations of BB indicators (e.g., levoglucosan and K+). These FTIR method can provide valuable chemical insights into the nature of the organic and inorganic components present in ambient aerosol particles during different pollution episodes.

AB  - Peripartum metabolism and subsequent reproductive performance of dairy cows are linked, with maladaptation over the transition period associated with poor reproductive success. A herd of seasonal calving, grazing dairy cows was established that differed in their genetic merit for fertility traits. The heifers were produced by a customized mating program to achieve a 10-percentage point divergence in the New Zealand fertility breeding value (FertBV) as follows: +5 FertBV (POS) versus -5% FertBV (NEG), while also limiting divergence in other breeding values, including body weight, body condition score, and milk production. In this study, we aimed to characterize differences in metabolic, mineral, and metabolic stress marker profiles during their first postpartum transition period as primiparous heifers and to examine if animals with longer postpartum anestrous intervals (PPAI; more than 66 d compared with less than 35 d) had greater metabolic dysfunction. Blood was sampled at -21, -14, -7, 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 28, and 35 d relative to calving in 455 primiparous cows and plasma analyzed. The NEG cows had lower concentrations of both plasma nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate at d 7 compared with POS cows. Detailed temporal profiling of various metabolic, mineral, and metabolic stress markers was undertaken in a subset of cows (n = 70). Cows were selected retrospectively to create 4 groups in a 2 x 2 factorial design with either a POS or NEG FertBV and either a short (19-35 d) or long (66-131 d) PPAI. The NEG cows tended, on average, to have lower nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations compared with POS cows across the transition period. Mean NEG cows when compared with the POS cows and an interaction with day demonstrated this only occurred precalving. They also had indications of improved liver health precalving, with higher albumin-to-globulin ratios and lower bilirubin concentrations. Concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase were lower, and the Na-to-Cl ratio was greater in cows with a long versus a short PPAI at d 28 and d 35 after calving, potentially because of cows with a short PPAI (19-35 d) returning to estrous during this time. Magnesium concentrations were lower in NEG cows with a short PPAI from d 21 onwards, indicating NEG cows may metabolically respond to estrous differently than POS cows. The NEG-long PPAI cows had greater gammaglutamyl transferase concentrations from calving until d 28 and lower bilirubin concentrations throughout the transition period. Together, the results demonstrate significant effects of FertBV on peripartum metabolic status. However, most of the markers tested returned to reference intervals within 4 d after calving or remained within those intervals for the whole transition period, indicating relatively minor biological effects of FertBV on transition period adaptation. The profound differences in reproductive performance among the groups was not explained by underlying differences in metabolic responses during the transition period.

AB  - Forest land is the carrier for growing forests. It is of great significance to evaluate the forest land quality scientifically and delineate forestland protection zones reasonably for realizing better forest land management, promoting ecological civilization construction, and coping with global climate change. In this study, taking Hefeng County, Hubei Province, a subtropical humid evergreen broad-leaved forest region in China, as the study area, 14 indicators were selected from four dimensions-climatic conditions, terrain, soil conditions, and socioeconomics-to construct a forest land quality evaluation index system. Based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model, we introduced the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to design the evaluation model to evaluate the forest land quality and analyze the distribution of forest land quality in Hefeng. Further, we used the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) to explore the spatial distribution of forest land quality and delineate the forest land protection zones. The results showed the following: (1) the overall quality of forest land was high, with some variability between regions. The range of Forest Land Quality Index (FLQI) in Hefeng was 0.4091-0.8601, with a mean value of 0.6337. The forest land quality grades were mainly first and second grade, with the higher-grade forest land mainly distributed in the central and southeastern low mountain regions of Zouma, Wuli, and Yanzi. The lower-grade forest land was mainly distributed in the northwestern middle and high mountain regions of Zhongying, Taiping, and Rongmei. (2) The global spatial autocorrelation index of forest land quality in Hefeng County was 0.7562, indicating that the forest land quality in the county had a strong spatial similarity. The spatial distribution of similarity types high-high (HH) and low-low (LL) was more clustered, while the spatial distribution of dissimilarity types high-low (HL) and low-high (LH) was generally dispersed. (3) Based on the LISA of forest land quality, forest land protection zones were divided into three types: key protection zones (KPZs), active protection zones (APZs), and general protection zones (GPZs). The forest land protection zoning basically coincided with the forest land quality. Combining the characteristics of self-correlated types in different forestland protection zones, corresponding management and protection measures were proposed. This showed that the PSO-TOPSIS model can be effectively used for forest land quality evaluation. At the same time, the spatial attributes of forest land were incorporated into the development of forest land protection zoning scheme, which expands the method of forest land protection zoning, and can provide a scientific basis and methodological reference for the reasonable formulation of forest land use planning in Hefeng County, while also serving as a reference for similar regions and countries.

AB  - This research studied the interrelationship between the immune and oxidative-antioxidant systems in a group of individuals who had lived for a long time in areas contaminated with radionuclides after the Chemobyl catastrophe and as a result experienced prolonged exposure to small doses of ionizing radiation. We have examined a group of 100 students aged 18-24, where 50 of them formed the control group and the remaining 50 belonged to the experimental group as they arrived from the territories of enhanced radioecological control (IV radiation zone, density of soil contamination by isotope Cs-137 3.7 x 10(4)- 18.5 x 10(4) Bq/m(2)). Here we determined the level of cortisol, leukocytes and their populations, the levels of lymphocyte subpopulations with phenotypes CD3+, CD5+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD72+, immunoregulatory index CD4+/CD8+, indicators of phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes, IgG (H), IgM (H), IgA (H), malondialdehyde (MDA), ceruloplasmin (CP), transferrin (Tr), sulfhydryl (SH); and also calculated the oxidative stress index (OSI). We performed the analysis twice: in the absence/presence of additional emotional stress such as an examination session. The studies showed an increase in the oxidative stress index in the group examined from the experimental cluster, especially in terms of emotional stress. At the same time, the neutrophil level increased, but phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes, the relative and absolute number of lymphocytes with phenotypes CD3+, CD5+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+, and IgG levels decreased. Consequently we revealed the negative correlation between the indexes of oxidative stress in the group of examined (the oxidative stress index (ISO)/the level of malonic dialdehyde (MDA)) and the parameters of phagocytic activity of monocytes, the immunoregulatory index CD4+/CD8+, and the number of lymphocytes with the CD16+ phenotype. In this study we demonstrated the decrease in the participation of ceruloplasmin (CP) as an important antioxidant factor in maintaining the immune homeostasis of the group examined from radiation-contaminated areas compared with control group. The evidence of this is the lack of reliable correlation between ceruloplasmin level and immune system parameters. Moreover we found that radiationinduced intensification of oxidative processes in the experimental group grew in conditions of additional stresses of an emotional nature. Besides, it was accompanied by a significant correlation in the level of oxidative stress and phagocytic activity parameters. Reducing phagocytic activity and the CD4+/CD8+ index on the background of oxidative stress increase can be considered as a sign of immune system ageing, while a decrease in the number of lymphocytes with the CD16+ phenotype is a sign of antitumor defense inhibition. Thus, we draw the conclusion that the inhabitants of the territories of strengthened radioecological control, undergoing exposure to small doses of ionizing radiation from birth, show a significant imbalance of redox homeostasis, which creates the preconditions for immunoreactivity pathology development at the level of both innate and acquired immunity.

AB  - We investigated the ostracod assemblage structure in springs of a small lowland River Krpiel valley. Environmental factors and the potential of ostracods as indicators of spring type were analysed. The analysis involved the type of spring, substrate, physicochemical parameters, and the river valley's hydrological status as environmental factors. A total of thirty ostracod species were recorded. The average count of ostracod individuals in a sample amounted to 100. The assemblages were dominated by juvenile Candona sp., juvenile Psychrodromus sp., Cypria ophtalmica, and Cypridopsis vidua. The spring species accounted for less than 1% of the individual counts, except for juvenile Psychrodromus sp. with 21% and Eucypris pigra with 4%. The average number of taxa per spring was 5. The ostracod assemblages were significantly influenced by limnocrene springs, spring flooding by the river overflow, the presence of coarse leaf litter, the presence of fine organic matter, a high content of NH4 as well as by BOD5, conductivity, pH, Fe, the river habitat modification index (RHM), the habitat modification score (HMS), and the river habitat quality (RHQ). The habitat conditions for the spring species appeared to be enhanced by the domination of mineral substrate over fine particulate organic matter, an elevated pH, the presence of leaf-derived organic matter, and the absence of flooding by the river. The spring species showed no association with the Krpiel valley hydrological factors.

AB  - The industrial sector is the most important segment of the macroeconomic environment of the country, the performance of which depends on its functioning and development in the global economic environment. The development of industry in the national macroeconomic environment is possible at the expense of an effective regulatory system, which should have modern instrumental support that corresponds to modern trends in the development of global economic systems. The article is based on the theoretical and methodological foundations of the formation of a system for regulating the development of industry and defining its conceptual benchmarks in the conditions of transformation changes in the economy. Methodology. Legislative and normative documents, materials of periodicals, statistical data, and Internet resources were the information base of the study. The paper uses general scientific and special methods: monographic examination, generalization, systematization, economic-statistical analysis, and modelling. This allowed investigating the current state and possibilities of regulating the development of industry in different models of the regulatory system and the forms of its implementation, substantiating the conceptual foundations and directions of the transformation of the system of regulation of the development of the domestic industrial sector and criteria for evaluating its effectiveness. Results. It is proved that the process of regulating the development of industry in the national economy should be considered from the point of view of a systemic approach in the macroeconomic environment, where the basic elements of a defined system are the purpose, strategic guidelines and objectives, principles and limitations, regulatory functions, institutional actors that influence on industry and its structural units with the help of well-grounded tools. The expediency of assessing the system of regulation of industrial development based on the criteria of rationality, regulation, management, and efficiency is proved, and models of the corresponding analytical indicators are proposed. It is proved that the formation of the most perspective and effective mechanism of regulating the development of the industry is to find the optimal combination of vectors of rationality and efficiency in the implementation of all large-scale transformations in the system of regulation in the national macroeconomic environment. The alternative development options in the domestic industrial sector and the relevant conceptual guidelines for the regulation of the development of industry in the national macroeconomic environment are determined. Practical meaning. The introduction of these results in order to change the system of regulation of industrial development will contribute to ensuring the role of the industrial sector as the main driver of innovation and investment development of the country's economy. Value/originality. The author's definition of the process of regulating the development of industry from the standpoint of the system approach, proposed methodological approaches to the assessment of the effectiveness of the development regulation system according to criteria and indicators of rationality and manageability, is aimed at the further formation of system measures to create favourable conditions for the development of industry in the national macroeconomic environment.

AB  - As a major component of land ecological systems, vegetation is generally considered a sensitive indicator of climate change. This study makes use of GIMMS-NDVI3g, as well as conventional climate data observed on the ground by the China Meteorological Administration, to study the spatio-temporal variations and driving factors of vegetation cover during the period from 1982 to 2013 in the "mountain-oasis-desert" coupled system of Xinjiang and its 11 sub-systems including mountains, oasis, plains, and desert. The coefficient of variation is used to study the variability of vegetation cover in this representative system; the Theil-Sen median analysis and Mann-Kendall trend test are used to investigate the vegetation cover patterns and trend in this system; the results obtained from the Hurst index are integrated to study the sustainability of the NDVI pattern in this system. This study demonstrates that 1) the temporal-spatial vegetation cover for the mountain-oasis-desert system shows great differences in different ecoregions and the mountain and oasis regions generally show an increasing trend in each year. 2) In 32 years, the vegetation cover in Xinjiang shows variation at a medium level (average value of CVNDVI is 0.116) and a higher spatial variation in the desert than the oasis and mountain regions; 3) the vegetation cover in each ecoregion of the mountain-oasis-desert system exhibits a trend of improvement or degradation and the vegetation cover trend in the oasis and mountain subsystems have clearly improved. 4) The vegetation cover sustainability of the mountain-oasis-desert system also shows great differences among the different ecoregions; the desert vegetation cover in this system exhibits sustainability and a degradation trend but the vegetation cover of the oasis exhibits a trend of sustainable improvement. In addition, the variations trend of the vegetation cover in the mountain areas shows obvious regional differences. 5) The comprehensive analysis of the vegetation cover variations in different ecoregions of the typical system demonstrates that the vegetation cover variations are affected by the combined or synergetic action of hydrothermal conditions such as temperature, precipitation, as well as humidity. In addition, the fluctuations in the vegetation cover in this system are the result of the combined action of temperature and precipitation (r = 0.35, p < 0.05). The vegetation cover trend of this system is significantly affected by precipitation (r = 0.22, p < 0.05). The climate in this system has changed to warmer and wetter conditions, which has improved the vegetation cover in this typical system (r(al) = -0.20, P-al < 0.05; r(temp) = 0.21, P-temp < 0.05). In addition, the sustainability of the vegetation cover in this system results from the combined effect of temperature and precipitation (r = 0.38, p < 0.05). This study on the variations in the NDVI spatial patterns for the mountain-oasis-desert system is of great theoretical and practical significance for studies of arid areas.

AB  - Since the permanent fixation of pregnant sows is banned in Europe, it has become a matter of discussion as to whether the permanent fixation of lactating sows is still acceptable. A group-housing system for lactating sows offers the sows and their piglets the possibility to live in a more natural structure. The aim of this study was to compare sows from a group-housing system (GH; n = 80) with sows from a conventional single-housing system (SH; n = 64) with regard to health indicators and saliva cortisol levels. Data were collected in four batches with 20 GH sows and 16 SH sows per batch. All sows were moved one week before farrowing to the GH or the SH system, respectively. The nulliparous sows were housed separately from the multiparous sows during pregnancy. Thus, nulliparous and multiparous sows were unfamiliar when they moved to the GH system. The GH sows were housed in a group of ten sows and were separated into their individual free-farrowing pens from three days ante partum until six days post partum. A running area was shared by all sows and piglets. With regard to health indicators, the GH sows had fewer skin lesions of the udder and of the tail compared to the SH sows (p < 0.05). Moreover, the GH sows had more skin lesions on the body (p < 0.05) due to ranking fights and were dirtier (p < 0.05) because they used the running area as a resting and dunging area. Furthermore, the GH sows had a higher body condition after weaning (p < 0.05), which can be explained by ad libitum feeding and the fewer number and lighter weight of weaned piglets (p < 0.05). With regard to health indicators of the piglets, the interaction between housing system and batch showed that the GH piglets had fewer skin lesions of the face (p < 0.05). In addition, they had fewer skin lesions of the face one week post partum (p < 0.05) and did not differ from the SH piglets regarding their incidence of skin lesions of the face four weeks post partum. Furthermore, the GH piglets showed more skin lesions of the body compared to the SH piglets (p < 0.05) across almost all batches. With regard to the saliva cortisol levels, both the GH and SH sows did not differ in their basal levels two weeks ante partum. However, the GH sows had higher cortisol levels during lactation compared to the SH sows (p < 0.05). To conclude, no alarming health problems were documented for the GH sows and SH sows or their piglets. Moreover, the higher cortisol levels of the GH sows could be caused by factors as social interactions and increased physical activity.

AB  - In order to understand fully the factors that determine the stratigraphic architecture of shallow water carbonate systems, the integration of information found in the adjacent basinal sediments is essential. With this purpose a buildup margin-to-basin transition of Upper Devonian (Frasnian) age has been investigated in outcrops in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The study combined the platform margin geometry, as an indicator of relative sea level change, and the geochemical characteristics of the adjacent basin sediments to provide a more complete picture of the evolution of this mixed carbonate/siliciclastic sedimentary system.
   The Frasnian represents a 2nd order transgressive/regressive sequence, which can be subdivided in six 3rd order sequences, each of which is characterised by specific platform margin geometries. Vertical measured sections show a distinct pattern in the cross plots of the carbonate and organic carbon for each 3rd order sequence. Particularly striking is the inverse linear relationship observed in sequences 3 and 4, between the carbonate content, and the organic matter and clay content. This is interpreted as a dilution relationship, whereby low carbonate input and dysaerobic conditions led to the accumulation of large amounts of organic matter in the basin. Maximum accumulation of organic matter occurred in two 3rd order sequences preceding the 2nd order maximum flooding surface (sequences 3 and 4), and highest concentrations are recorded in the lowstand of sequence 4. In addition, rapid lateral changes in sediment composition have also been observed around the carbonate buildup.
   Four sedimentologic phases in the Frasnian basin infill pattern are defined. Sequence 1 is characterised by regional shallow-water carbonate ramps and platforms. In sequence 2, platforms retrograde and buildups are initiated; the topography is low, and the sediment composition is carbonate dominated. Sequences 3 and 4 show buildup aggradation and basin starvation, which caused the development of a pronounced topography. In this phase a dilution relationship appears between carbonate versus organic matter and clays. Carbonate input is low, and a large amount of organic matter accumulated in the dysaerobic basin. In sequences 5 and 6, clays fill in the basin, and isolated platforms prograde. The topography is reduced, and sediment composition is dominated by carbonate and clay.
   The stratigraphic architecture is interpreted to be primarily the result of different orders of (eustatic) fluctuations in relative sea level. In addition, dysaerobic conditions at the sea floor enhanced organic matter accumulation in sequences 3 and 4, while as yet undefined environmental factors probably played a role in the change from regional platforms to isolated buildups (sequence 1 to 2). Finally, circulation patterns in the basin contributed to increased sedimentation of (fine-grained) siliciclastics towards the end of the Frasnian (sequences 5 and 6). Since there is strong evidence for a relative sea level control of the sedimentation pattern, the here proposed model will be predictive for the stratigraphic architecture in the Alberta shale basins, and greatly facilitate correlation with the adjacent subsurface.

AB  - A combination of five techniques was used to infer the paleobathymetry and paleoecology of 103 foraminiferal faunas (>63 mu m, census counts of 384 benthic species) from throughout the lower Miocene Waitemata Basin, Auckland, northern New Zealand. A canonical correspondence analysis ordination showed that environmental factors related to paleobathymetry were the main drivers of benthic foraminiferal composition and samples were sorted in approximate paleo-depth order using increasing planktic percentage and species diversity proxies. Cluster analysis recognised seven associations (A-G) and eight subassociations, which were interpreted in terms of paleo-bathymetry and paleoproductivity by qualitative comparison with modern faunas. Planktic-percentage-based regression (with benthic stress-indicator taxa removed) and a Modern Analogue Technique comparison (at generic level) of fossil benthic assemblages with a modern dataset (626 faunas from 0-5000 m) were both used to provide quantitative paleobathymetry estimates for each Miocene fauna. These paleo-depth estimates were refined using the upper- and lower-depth limits of some of the less common benthics present. No one technique appears to be better than others. All can provide anomalous paleo-bathymetric estimates that need to be explained. Paleo-depth estimates are most consistent and precise for inner-mid shelf faunas and become less precise and more frequently inconsistent with increasing depth. A number of faunas with inconsistent paleo-bathymetric estimates contain both shallow- and deep-water-restricted benthic tests. These are interpreted as resulting from the inclusion of reworked deep-water fossil tests into shallow faunas, or mixing of contemporaneous tests as sediment flowing from shelf depths down into the basin in turbidity currents and debris flows. The eight bathyal-abyssal associations and subassociations have overlapping depth ranges but only 3-4 of them were present in the basin at any one time. Their geographic distribution reflects a crude depth-related zonation, whereas their stratigraphic succession is inferred to have resulted from a period of increased carbon flux and decreased bottom oxygen sandwiched between periods of lower carbon flux and more oxic bottom conditions.
   The recognised associations are: A, Elphidium, intertidal-subtidal beach; B, Nonionella-Notorotalia, sheltered inner shelf; C, Amphistegina-Cibicides, exposed inner-outer shelf; D, Astrononion-Gyvoidina, >= mid-bathyal; E, Bolivina, mid-lower bathyal; F, Cibicides-Bolivina, bathyal; G, Oridovsalis-Neugeborina-Pullenia, >= lower bathyal. The inferred paleoenvironment of the faunas is used to help resolve the paleogeographic history of the Waitemata Basin. Thin basal transgressive sequences of lensing conglomerate, shelly sandstone and limestone containing shelf faunas (Assocs A-C) record initiation of basin subsidence over a wide area (300 x 100 km), similar to 21 Ma. Continued subsidence (estimated from foraminiferal data at similar to 1 mm/yr) was accompanied by sediment starvation with little or no sediment accumulating until the basin reached lower bathyal depths (F, G). This created sufficient slope for turbidity currents from the north to flow down submarine canyons and deposit three interfmgering submarine fans of sandstone (800-1000 m thick). Displaced Cretaceous-Oligocene nappes and melange (Northland Allochthon) moved part way into the basin from the north and large sub-seafloor slides of mixed basinal sediment and allochthon slid off its advancing toe. These slides were triggered by uplift of the northern part of the basin, which created land fringed by a wide shelf (C). A large submarine stratovolcano built up on the west side of the basin and shed volcaniclastic sediment (C, D, F) down its eastern slopes with some debris flows transporting mixed shallow water faunas up to 30 km into the basin. The similar to 4 million-year-life of this subduction-related basin came to an end with complete eversion before the end of the early Miocene.

AB  - Simple Summary Ensuring good health and welfare is an increasingly important consideration for conservation of endangered species, whether free-ranging or managed to varying degrees under human care. The welfare-based design of a new habitat for Asian elephants focused on meeting the elephants' physical, physiological, psychological, and social needs 24 h a day and across life stages. In this study, multiple elephant health and welfare indicators measured throughout transition and acclimation from the previous habitat to this new habitat provided evidence that the complexity, flexibility, space, and resource distribution of the new habitat was effective in improving overall welfare. The elephants were more active and walked farther on a daily basis in the new habitat, with an average walking distance of over 15 km per day. Disbursement of food with less temporal and spatial predictability increased foraging opportunities, which is important for psychological well-being of this species. All individuals showed adaptive and normal adrenal responses to the changes and challenges throughout the construction period and subsequent acclimation to a novel environment. They demonstrated social dynamics of a healthy herd in both habitats with transitions of individuals through life stages; however, in the new habitat they exhibited more autonomy in choosing whom to associate with socially, suggesting increased social equity for individuals. Ensuring good health and welfare is an increasingly important consideration for conservation of endangered species, whether free-ranging or managed to varying degrees under human care. The welfare-based design of a new habitat for Asian elephants at the Oregon Zoo focused on meeting the elephants' physical, physiological, psychological, and social needs 24 h a day and across life stages. The habitat was designed to encourage activity, promote species-typical behaviors, support changing social dynamics, offer increased opportunities for choice, and provide biologically meaningful challenges. In this 4-year study, we monitored elephant health and welfare indicators throughout the transition and acclimation from the previous habitat to the new habitat. Several welfare indicators obtained through longitudinal hormone analyses, behavior assessments, and GPS measurement of walking distance and space use provided evidence that these goals were achieved. The elephants were more active and walked farther on a daily basis in the new habitat, with an average walking distance of over 15 km per day. A switch from primarily caretaker-delivered food to seeking food on their own indicates that the disbursement of food with less temporal and spatial predictability increased foraging opportunities, which better satisfies appetitive motivations important for psychological well-being. All individuals showed adaptive and normal adrenal responses to change and challenge, with the highest fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations and variability during the construction phase, and a return to previous baseline concentrations in the new habitat, suggesting they acclimated well to the new environment. The elephants expressed a diverse range of species-typical behaviors and demonstrated social dynamics of a healthy herd in both habitats with transitions of individuals through life stages. They exhibited more autonomy in choosing whom to associate with socially and also by choosing different aspects of their environment with regular indoor/outdoor access and extensive resource use in the new habitat.
   Findings indicate that the complexity and flexibility of the new habitat and habitat management has been effective in improving overall welfare by providing meaningful challenges and the opportunity to express appetitive behaviors, by offering choice in environmental conditions, and by providing the space and resource distribution to support evolving herd dynamics and increased social equity for individuals.

AB  - To assess how the Exxon Valdez oil spill affected habitat occupancy by communities of marine-oriented birds in Prince William Sound, Alaska, we conducted a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) using data collected between 1989 and 1996 in 10 bays that had been exposed to different levels of oiling. CCA creates a multivariate space defined by a combination of environmental variables and measures of the abundances of the bird species present in the bays. The locations of individual sites (site scores) in this multivariate space indicate how bird-community composition at the sites varies in relation to the combination of environmental variables, while the locations of individual bird species (species scores) indicate the mean values of the response curves (abundance variations) of species on the CCA axes. Relationships among the site scores of sites exposed to different levels of oiling may therefore be used to evaluate the effects of the spill on the bird communities occupying these sites, and the relationship of a species score to the site scores indicates the conditions under which the species is, on average, most abundant.
   In surveys conducted the summer after the oil spill, the site scores for unoiled or lightly oiled ("unoiled") bays occupied a region of the CCA space that was largely separate from that occupied by the moderately or heavily oiled ("oiled") bays, indicating consistent differences in bird-community composition. Although the structure of the CCA ordination and site locations in that space varied among seasons and years, the separation of the unoiled and oiled site scores in the CCA space continued. Rather than indicating continuing spill effects, however the separation of site scores was probably related to environmental differences among the bays and chance differences among bays in the reassembly of bird communities following the spill.
   Consideration of the locations of species scores in the CCA space clarified the patterns of spill impacts and subsequent recovery. The increase in the number of bird species present in early summer surveys between 1989 and 1990 was associated with the occupancy of previously oiled bays by species that were absent in 1989 or that previous analyses had shown to be initially impacted by the spill. Species scores for birds for which the previous analyses showed continuing spill impacts in early summer 1990 were associated most closely with the site scores of the unoiled bays. The species scores of several species that occurred too infrequently to be evaluated in the previous studies were associated with the site scores of the unoiled bays in 1989, suggesting initial spill impacts. In subsequent years, these species scores were associated with the site scores of the previously oiled bays, suggesting reoccupancy of those bays. Patterns for surveys conducted in midsummer generally were similar to those in early summer. Surveys conducted in midsummer 1996 suggested continuing recovery in the use of initially oiled habitats by birds, including some species that did not show clear evidence of recovery in 1991. Overall, these analyses showed that the Exxon Valdez oil spill had clear initial impacts on bird species and communities in the study bays in Prince William Sound, but they also provided clear evidence of increasing occupancy of previously oiled sites. Multivariate analyses such as CCA can provide valuable insights into the complex responses of environments and biological communities to large-scale contamination events when precontamination data are lacking, especially when the analyses are repeated over time and the changing relationships of both species and site scores in the multivariate space are considered.

AB  - Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications v.2 (MERRA-2), Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Operational Analysis (CAMS-OA), and a high-resolution regional Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) were used to evaluate natural and anthropogenic particulate matter (PM) air pollution in the Middle East (ME) during 2015-2016. Two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) retrievals - combined product Deep Blue and Deep Target (MODIS-DB&DT) and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) - and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations as well as in situ PM measurements for 2016 were used for validation of the WRF-Chem output and both assimilation products.
   MERRA-2 and CAMS-OA assimilate AOD observations. WRF-Chem is a free-running model, but dust emission in WRF-Chem is tuned to fit AOD and aerosol volume size distributions obtained from AERONET. MERRA-2 was used to construct WRF-Chem initial and boundary conditions both for meteorology and chemical and aerosol species. SO2 emissions in WRF-Chem are based on the novel OMI-HTAP SO2 emission dataset.
   The correlation with the AERONET AOD is highest for MERRA-2 (0.72-0.91), MAIAC (0.63-0.96), and CAMS-OA (0.65-0.87), followed by MODIS-DB&DT (0.56-0.84) and WRF-Chem (0.43-0.85). However, CAMS-OA has a relatively high positive mean bias with respect to AERONET AOD. The spatial distributions of seasonally averaged AODs from WRF-Chem, assimilation products, and MAIAC are well correlated with MODIS-DB&DT AOD product. MAIAC has the highest correlation (R = 0.8), followed by MERRA-2 (R = 0.66), CAMS-OA (R = 0.65), and WRFChem (R = 0.61). WRF-Chem, MERRA-2, and MAIAC underestimate and CAMS-OA overestimates MODIS-DB&DT AOD.
   The simulated and observed PM concentrations might differ by a factor of 2 because it is more challenging for the model and the assimilation products to reproduce PM concentration measured within the city. Although aerosol fields in WRF-Chem and assimilation products are entirely consistent, WRF-Chem is preferable for analysis of regional air quality over the ME due to its higher spatial resolution and better SO2 emissions. The WRF-Chem' s PM background concentrations exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines over the entire ME. Mineral dust is the major contributor to PM (approximate to 75 %-95 %) compared to other aerosol types. Near and downwind from the SO2 emission sources, nondust aerosols (primarily sulfate) contribute up to 30 % to PM2.5. The contribution of sea salt to PM in coastal regions can reach 5 %. The contributions of organic matter, black carbon and organic carbon to PM over the Middle East are insignificant. In the major cities over the Arabian Peninsula, the 90th percentile of PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with diameters less than 10 and 2.5 mu m, respectively) daily mean surface concentrations exceed the corresponding Kingdom of Saudi Arabia air quality limits The contribution of the nondust component to PM2.5 is < 25 %, which limits the emission control effect on air quality. The mitigation of the dust effect on air quality requires the development of environment-based approaches like growing tree belts around the cities and enhancing in-city vegetation cover. The WRF-Chem configuration presented in this study could be a prototype of a future air quality forecast system that warns the population against air pollution hazards.

AB  - Energy saving, CO2 reduction, and energy generation from renewable sources represent the three cornerstones of the energetic and environmental commitments of all the countries in the world. These three elements may give a quantitative contribution to the sustainability in an industrial environment. Among them, the most important one, that represents a driver in many sectors, is the limitation of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere: most recent data (2013) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA-ERSL) set at 395.55 parts per million (ppm) the CO2 in the atmosphere and the continuous increasing trend will quickly allow to reach the 450 ppm level which is considered as a safeguard limit to avoid irreversible environmental and socioeconomics problems. Looking at the energy consumption side, energy saving is a key factor. Compressed air production does not escape this requirement and, for the compressor manufacturing industry, this can represent an opportunity with great potential benefits. Compressed air is produced by electrical energy and the consumption accounts as much as 10% of industrial consumption of electricity. A lower estimate places at 6% this share but an additional 12% is estimated to be associated with the commercial and residential markets (portable tools, air pumps, pneumatic heating, ventilation, air conditioning, etc.). Hence, the overall compressor needs are estimated equal to 20% of the industrial electricity needs. Considering that industrial consumption of electricity represents a given share of the overall electrical energy consumption (it depends on the geographical context, social development, industrial level, etc.), with good approximation, compressed air can be associated to the overall electricity consumption and to primary energy consumption too. So, it can be compared with the other energy alternatives when the data are reliable and referred to real situations, actions to promote energy efficiency in compressed air systems can be identified with their real importance and compared with all the other measures. From many independent studies the most important energy saving measures are associated to the: (1) reduction of leakages on the distribution lines, (2) a more appropriate compressed air system design, (3) use of adjustable speed drives, (4) waste heat recovery. All these aspects, in a 10-year period of operation, weigh 70-75% of the overall compressed air costs. Therefore, the compressor technology is a key factor to reduce energy consumption including in it load control, variable speed operation, compressor sizing, etc. A great potential saving is associated to leaks, friction pipes, etc. but these actions are downstream of the compressed air production. After having discussed some issues concerning the future overall energy consumption and CO2 emissions, considering the development of the electricity market in the world in the near future, and overall energy characteristics of existing machines widely used in the compressed air market, the article goes deep inside a specific compressor technology which is represented by the sliding vanes rotary type. Principal processes inside these machines are discussed in the light of the recent scientific literature advancement of a theoretical and experimental nature.
   The general idea was that these machines are not so well known and their use is not so widespread: thanks to a deeper scientific interest over the past few years, these compressors had a notable performance improvement, thus a greater potential in industrial applications. Thanks to some intrinsic aspects, some energy issues are presented and related to specific processes inside the machine and compared with other compressors. The potential further improvements in terms of specific energy are discussed and addressed in main future research directions.

AB  - Flutes and tool marks are commonly observed sedimentary structures on the bases of sandstones in deep-water successions. These sole structures are universally used as palaeocurrent indicators but, in sharp contrast to most sedimentary structures, they are not used in palaeohydraulic reconstructions or to aid prediction of the spatial distribution of sediments. Since Kuenen's famous 1953 paper, flutes and tool marks in deep-water systems have been linked to turbidity currents, as reflected in the standard Bouma sequence taught to generations of geologists. Yet, these structures present a series of unaddressed enigmas. Detailed field studies in the 1960s and early 1970s observed that flutes are typically associated with thicker, more proximal beds, whilst tools are generally prevalent in thinner, more distal, beds. Additionally, flutes and tool marks are rarely observed on the same surfaces, and flutes are seen to change downstream from larger wider parabolic to smaller narrower spindle-shaped forms. No model has been proposed that explains these field-based observations. This contribution undertakes a radical re-examination of the formative flow conditions of flutes and tool marks, and demonstrates that they are the products of a wide range of sediment gravity flows, from turbulent flows, through transitional clay-rich flows, to debris flows. Flutes are not solely the product of turbulent flows, but can continue to form in transitional flows. Grooves are shown to be formed by debris flows, slumps and slides, not turbidity currents, and in many cases the debris flows are linked to the debritic component of hybrid flows. Discontinuous tool marks, including skim (bounce) marks, prod marks and skip marks, are shown to be formed by transitional mud-rich flows. Consequently, the observed spatial distribution of flutes and tool marks can be explained by a progressive increase in flow cohesivity downstream. This model of flutes and tool marks dovetails with models of hybrid flows that predict such a longitudinal increase in flow cohesivity. However, some deposits show grooves preferentially associated with Bouma T-A beds, and these are likely formed by flows transforming from higher to lower cohesion, and are present in basins where hybrid beds are absent or rare. The recognition that sole structures may have no genetic link to the later overlying turbidity current deposits, and can be formed by a wide range of flow types, indicates that the existing pictorial description of the Bouma sequence is incorrect. A modified Bouma sequence is proposed here that addresses these points. In utilizing the advances in fluid dynamics since Kuenen's pioneering research, this study demonstrates that it is possible to use flutes and tool marks to interpret flow type at the point of formation, the nature of flow transformations, and the mechanics of the basal layer. These advances suggest that it is then possible to predict the nature of deposit type down-dip. This new understanding, in combination with further testing in outcrop of the proposed relationships between sole marks and palaeohydraulics, opens up a wealth of possibilities for improving the understanding of deep-water clastic environments, with implications for developing more complete facies models, assessing subaqueous geohazards and the resilience of seafloor infrastructure, and advancing our understanding of deep-water sediments as archives of palaeoenvironmental change.

AB  - During 1949-1967, a U mine, a coal-fired thermal power plant and a processing plant for the extraction of U from the produced ash were operated at the Kadji Sai U mining site in Tonsk district, Issyk-Kul County, Kyrgyzstan. The Kadji Sal U legacy site represents a source of contamination of the local environment by naturally occurring radionuclides and associated trace elements. To assess the environmental impact of radionuclides and trace metals at the site, field expeditions were performed in 2007 and 2008 by the Joint collaboration between Norway, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,Tajikistan (JNKKT) project and the NATO SfP RESCA project In addition to in situ gamma and Rn dose rate measurements, sampling included at site fractionation of water and sampling of water, fish, sediment, soils and vegetation. The concentrations of radionuclides and trace metals in water from Issyk-Kul Lake were in general low, but surprisingly high for As. Uptake of U and As was also observed in fish from the lake with maximum bioconcentration factors for liver of 1.6 and 75, respectively. The concentrations of U in water within the Kadji Sai area varied from 0.01 to 0.05 mg/L, except for downstream from the mining area where U reached a factor of 10 higher, 0.2 mg/L Uranium concentrations in the drinking water of Kadji Sai village were about the level recommended by the WHO for drinking water. The U-234/U-238 activity ratio reflected equilibrium conditions in the mining pond, but far from equilibrium outside this area (reaching 23 for an artesian well). Uranium, As and Ni were mainly present as low molecular mass (LMM; less than 10 kDa) species in all samples, indicating that these elemental species are mobile and potentially bioavailable.
   The soils from the mining sites were enriched in U, As and trace metals. Hot spots with elevated radioactivity levels were easily detected in Kadji Sai and radioactive particles were observed. The presence of particles carrying significant amount of radioactivity and toxic trace elements may represent a hazard during strong wind events (wind erosion). Based on sequential extractions, most of the elements were strongly associated with mineral matter, except for U and As having a relatively high remobilization potential. Low Kd was obtained for U (3.5 x 10(2) L/kg d.w.), intermediate Kds (similar to 3 x 10(3) L/kg d.w.) were obtained for Ra-226, As and Ni, while a high Kd (2.2 x 10(5) L/kg d.w.) were obtained for Pb. The accumulation of metals in fish gills reflected the LMM species in the Issyk-Kul water, and did not show any bioaccumulation. The muscle Hg concentrations in all fish species were low and did not represent any health risk even for groups at risk.
   Total gamma and Rn dose rate to man amounted to about 12 mSv/y, while the highest calculated dose rate for non-human species based on the ERICA Assessment Tool were obtained in terrestrial plants (164 mu Gy/h) due to the Ra exposure. The results obtained showed that radiation doses to resident public at all of the investigated sites in the Kadji Sai area were in general relatively low. Low radiological risk and no detrimental health impact on resident public can be expected at these sites. However, exposure to Rn and Tn in the living environment can be further reduced by implementing simple countermeasures such as ventilation of dwelling cellars. More focus in the Kadji Sai area should probably be put on trace elements, especially the As uptake in fish in Lake Issyk-Kul. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of technology of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an ordinary practice in many fields of human activities. Till the present time the solution of zones of hygienic protection of waters has been designed in zones. Now there are much enough bases proving that the greatest supply of biogenic substances into drainage basin comes from the Zone of Hygienic Protection III (Kvitek, 1994) which is the largest in view of its size. It seems to be that zone protection of waters should be replaced by differentiated soil and water conservation. Only in differentiated approach to single lands the change in the system of management on land, change in cultures and to improve soil and water conservation is required. Without this approach it will be very difficult to reach the reduction in volume of substances coming from the Zone of Hygienic Protection III into individual subsidiary basins and basins of accumulation of surface waters. Till the present time the lands for differentiated soil and water conservation have been chosen only according to geomorphological, pedological and hydrological indicators. To improve the quality of the process of choice of lands it will be necessary in GIS to form all sections which will classify, above all, hydrogeological section and section of actual erosion danger of lands. Only then by intersection of all above sections we shall come to optimization of the proposal of distribution of permanent grasslands and forest cultures in the landscape. By intersection of sections of water management map, classified soil-ecological unit BPEJ (in placing criteria of selection of classified soil-ecological unit) maps of drainage of lands, present condition of cultures, buffer zones and point sources of pollution and with regard to production of noxious materials, the territory will be classified into areas which should be reforested in view of water and soil conservation or grassed and into areas with necessary establishment of ponds; on remaining area it can be managed on arable land. By intersection of layers of water management maps, buffer zones and maps of erosion danger of lands, another selection of arable lands into soil without limitation of agricultural activity and into soils where technological, biological and management arrangements will be required will appear along with limitation of the use of territory due to higher erosion activities and potential danger to quality of surface and underground water. The complete territory of agricultural and fund can be classified into five types of lands by the process of selection of lands: a) forests, b) meadows and pastures, c) arable land with limitation of agricultural activities, d) arable land without limitation of agricultural activities, e) territory designed for water reservoirs of various function. This classification includes a criterion of vulnerability of surface and underground waters. Areas designed for grassing and forestation have the greatest degree of vulnerability of waters. Within Complex Land Reallocations it is necessary to carry out delimitation of cultures. The present state of cultures will be one of initial bases. This classification of lands, together with the proposal of criteria of vulnerability of surface and underground waters is a main principle of differentiated soil and water conservation. It follows from Tab.
   I that in the given territory is the motion of change of cultures into meadows from arable land in the extent of some 20% of the total area of farm land in the river basin. The transfer of forest was not performed, as there are no soils which should be reforested, another reason - that there are no extreme slopes, and a great part of the territory is forested.

AB  - Pelagic carbonate deposits formed by the thin-shelled, epifaunal, originally bimineralic bivalve Bositra buchi were geographically widely distributed in the Tethyan basins during the Middle Jurassic. Here, to evaluate conditions that allowed the formation of peculiar, metre-scale, densely-packed shell beds primarily formed by Bositra, we assess size distributions and preservation of this bivalve in thin sections at ten sites in the Pieniny Klippen Belt and Peri-Klippen units (Western Carpathians), representing a bathymetric transect from pelagic-platform tops with shell beds up to slope environments where small filaments occur with spicules and radiolarians. Although Bositra shell beds are modulated by transport and winnowing, three types of evidence indicate that they primarily reflect high bivalve productivity. First, we find that size distributions of this species form a bathymetric gradient, from the dominance of remains smaller than 0.5 mm in low-energy slope environments, to 0.5-2 mm on muddy platform edges, up to lensoid shell beds with large valves (similar to 2-15 mm) occurring on platform tops exposed to bottom currents. Although sediment winnowing from shell beds contributed to the rarity of small-sized specimens in platform-top environments, the bathymetric shift in the shape of size distributions is not purely driven by fragmentation and by size-selective transport of small specimens into slope environments because the average valve thickness declines with depth and thick fragments do not occur in slope environments. High abundances of suspension-feeding Bositra preferentially associated with indicators of bottom currents at oligophotic or aphotic depths indicate that plankton productivity was probably sourced by nutrient-rich internal waves that intersected platform tops, leading to low juvenile mortality in Bositra populations. In contrast, populations in deeper environments with the limited input of particulate organic matter failed to achieve maturity. Second, the inner, originally nacreous shell layer of Bositra is now represented by neomorphic calcite that is luminescent, enriched in Mn and depleted in Mg, indicating that this layer was not dissolved in the taphonomic active zone. Third, fibrous-acicular low-Mg calcite cements that characteristically coat Bositra in shell beds show blotchy luminescence and highly irregular Mg distribution, indicating that they were precipitated as high-Mg calcite cements. Fibrous-acicular cements in shell beds do not coat upward-facing sides of valves covered by a first phase of micrite whereas they fully coat elevated portions of the same valves. Therefore, they were precipitated at very high rates concurrently with micrite deposition in shelters. Nutrient-rich bottom currents thus simultaneously increased (1) Bositra survivorship by enhancing primary productivity and (2) cementation rate by renewal of saturation of pore waters in the taphonomic active zone at platform tops. In spite of the association of Bositra shell beds with major hiatal surfaces, (1) the rapid precipitation of fibrous-acicular cements, (2) the rarity of iron-stained Bositra valves in shell beds, and (3) the significantly smaller concentrations of iron in shell-rich muds than in shell-poor muds indicate that shell beds do not represent long-term hiatal or lag concentrations. They rather represent composite shell beds that record high population densities of these bivalves at ecological time scales.
   Spatial variation in intensity of bottom currents and in seafloor topography generated by faulted blocks resulted (1) in hiatal surfaces with mineralized hardgrounds at high-energy current-swept sites and (2) in preservation of up to 1 m-thick lensoid shell beds at sites with less intense but persistent currents. Bositra shell beds thus ultimately have patchy horizontal and stratigraphic distribution.

AB  - As a rich source of high activity antioxidant peptides, Scomberomorus niphonius is a key marine natural product with a high processing value. Due to the high complexity of fish tissues, high recovery extraction and high efficiency screening of the active antioxidant peptide species have become the major challenges for the research and development of preparation and separation techniques. Due to the high specificity of hydrolytic enzymes, when different types of enzymes are used for the hydrolysis of fish tissues, the resultant active peptides may have significant differences in chemical structures, biological functions, and physical activities. In this study, in order to obtain antioxidant peptides with high activity and functionality, defatted visceral powder of Scomberomorus niphonius was used as a raw material for sample preparation. Five hydrolytic enzymes ( flavor protease, trypsin, acid protease, neutral protease, and alkaline protease) were selected and investigated for their hydrolyzing efficiencies in visceral solutions of Scomberomorus niphonius, according to their optimum hydrolyzing conditions. The diphenyl bitter hydrazine radical ( DPPH center dot) scavenging rate, hydroxyl radical ( center dot OH) scavenging rate, and degree of hydrolysis ( DH) were adopted as indicators for hydro. lytic enzyme selection and optimization. The data suggested that, among all the hydrolytic enzymes investigated, trypsin presented the best scavenging capabilities for both DPPH center dot and center dot OH species, with scavenging rates of 88. 93% +/- 0. 82% for DPPH center dot and 53. 09% +/- 0. 73% for center dot OH, respectively. Based on the single. factor test results, the DPPH center dot scavenging rate was further utilized as an indicator and was found to depend on the hydrolytic enzyme quantity, hydrolyzation temperature, and hydrolyzation time. According to the Box. Behnken center composed experimental design, a triple factor and triple level response surface method was adopted for further optimization of antioxidant peptide preparation from Scomberomorus niphonius vis. cera. The preparation method was systematically optimized, and as a result, a degree of hydrolysis of 23. 66%, DPPH center dot scavenging rate of 93. 78%, and center dot OH scavenging rate of 62. 59% were achieved. High performance nano flow liquid chromatography is a new generation micro scale liquid phase separation technique that has the advantages of low sample requirement, low sol. vent consumption, and high efficiency. In this study, we applied this method to marine natural product purification. In order to screen the most suitable chromatographic stationary phase for the separation and analysis of active antioxidant peptides from Scomberomorus niphonius viscera, a nano flow reversed. phase C18 column ( 15 cmx100 mu m, 5 mu m, 30 nm) and a strong cation exchange column ( 15 cmx100 mu m, 5 mu m, 100 nm) were investigated. A nano flow high performance liquid chromatography platform with a 1 : 1 000 splitting ratio was adopted for this study. Using the enzyme. hydrolyzed solution from Scomberomorus niphonius viscera as the sample, following filtration, the antioxidant peptides were separated, collected, freeze-dried, and finally tested for their antioxidant capability. The results showed that the strong cation exchange phase was more suitable for antioxidant peptide isolation and purification from Scomberomorus niphonius viscera, and an antioxidant peptide component with high activity was successfully screened.
   During the activity test, the 50% inhibition concentration ( IC50) value of the DPPH center dot scavenging capability of this peptide was 0. 672 +/- 0. 051 mg / mL, which was 13. 6 times higher than the activity value before the peptide species was purified. The current study for the first time reports the application of high performance nano flow liquid chromatography in the purification and analysis of antioxidant peptides from a marine natural product source and also demonstrates the effectiveness and future prospect of the use of nano flow ion exchange chromatography for high performance separation and high efficiency screening of antioxidant peptides.

AB  - This paper presents a list of woody plant taxa and their dendrological and horticultural qualities. Taxonomical, ecological and phytogeographical analysis cover 239 of taxa. The results are given in Tables 1-2.
   There are 72 families, 156 genera and 239 of taxa in total (Table 1), twenty of them belonging to gymnosperms and 219 to angiosperms. The angiosperms group is largely dominated by the dicotyledones (205 taxa; 85.87%).
   Out of 72 families, four of them have more than 10 species and subspecies. The largest,number of species belongs to the Rosaceae (33 taxa; 13.80%), Fabaceae (14 taxa; 5.86%), Oleaceae (13 taxa; 5.44%) and Lamiaceae (11 taxa; 4.60%) families. Species from the above mentioned four families make 20:1% of the total woody plants of the Omis.
   The composition of woody plants of the Omis is quite heterogeneous which is obvious from a large number of families (72) and genera (156). There is only 1.53 species per genus and 3.32 species per family. The most frequent genera are Prunus (11 taxa), Tamarix (5 taxa) whereas Acer, Lonicera, Populus; Rosa and Ulmus are present with 4 taxa.
   Analysis of dendroflora due to habitat type (acc. to Erhardt et al. 2002) indicates the dominance of shrubby forms (132 of taxa; 55.23%), following by the trees (83; 34.73%), while the group of woody climbing plants is the least represented (24; 10.04%).
   Within the dendroflora of Omis, there are 89 (37.20%) autochthonous and 150 (62.80%) allochthonous species. Of the total number of taxa of autochthonous dendroflora, 43 of taxa (48.31%) occur in the wild, 24 (26.97%) grow only in culture, while 22 of taxa (24.72%) occur in culture as well as in the natural and semi-natural vegetation.
   The allochthonous ones are dominated by species in culture (121 species; 80.67%), casual (21; 14.00%) and 8 naturalised. These results are consistent with those relating to other parts of Croatia. An increased presence of allochthonous plants, especially neophytes, is a reliable indicator of the intensity of the anthropogenic impact to the flora.
   The majority of all the allochthonous species that appear on different areas never manage to get naturalised so their existance depends on the re-appearance of the diaspora. A small number of the naturalised species has the ability of invasively spreading beyond the place of their original appearance.
   In woody plants of the Omis, naturalised species are represented by 3 species (Agava americana, Morus alba and Prunus cerasifera) and the invasive ones by 5 species (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Amorpha fruticosa, Broussonetia papyrifera and Robinia pseudoacacia).
   Although only a small number of species brought into the culture has the ability to domesticate and spread invasively into the surrounding habitats, some of them can cause serious eco-system irregularities. In the region of Omis especially dangerous could become Amorpha fruticosa covering more and more areas along the Cetina river thus suppressing native species. Knowing that invasive species mainly domesticate and spread through horticulture it is advisable to avoid them in horticulture.
   Regarding geographical origins (Table 2), the allochthonous dendroflora of Omis is dominated by species from Asia (65 taxa; 43.33%), America (23.33%) and Europe (12.80%). The most frequent Asian species in the horticulture are those coming from China (Buddleja davidii, Kerria japonica, Rosa banksiae etc).
   Quite a significant number of woody species, autochthonous as well as allochthonous, and their high diversity attribute to an exceptional value of the dendroflora of Omis.
   The research results relating to woody plants of the Omis and other Croatian regions indicate an unjustified long-term neglect of autochthonous species in culture in comparison with the allochthonous ones even though they have adjusted themselves to the existing climate conditions which makes the maintenance of horticultural objects easier, not to mention that their decorative qualities match those of the allochthonous species.

AB  - Dynamics of suprabenthos and zooplankton were analyzed in two areas located in the NW (off Soller harbour) and S (off Cabrera Archipelago) of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean) at depths ranging between 135-780 m. Four stations situated respectively at 150 m (shelf-slope break), and at bathyal depths of 350, 650 and 750 m were sampled at bi-monthly intervals during six cruises performed between August 2003 and June 2004. Suprabenthos showed maximum biomass in both areas from late spring to summer (April to August), while minimum biomass was found in autumn (September-November). Though variable, temporal dynamics of zooplankton showed peaks of biomass in late winter and summer (February and June), while minimals occurred in autumn (August-September) and, at bathyal depths, in April. Suprabenthos (abundance; MDS analyses) showed a sample aggregation as a function of depth (3 groups corresponding to the shelf-slope break, upper slope - over 350 m; and the middle, deeper part of the slope - over 650-750 m), without any separation of hauls by season. By contrast, zooplankton samples were separated by season and not by depth. There was evidence of three seasonal groups corresponding to summer (June 2004-August 2003), autumn-winter (September and November 2003, February 2004), and spring (April 2004), being especially well established off Soller. In general, suprabenthos was significantly correlated with the sediment variables (e.g. total organic matter content (% OM), potential REDOX), whereas zooplankton was almost exclusively dependent on Chl a at the surface, which suggests two different food sources for suprabenthos and zooplankton. The increase of suprabenthos abundance in April-June was paralleled by a sharp increase (ca. 2.8 times) in the %OM on sediment during the same period, coupled ca. 1-2 months of delay with the peak of surface Chl a recorded in February-March (from satellite imagery data). Suprabenthos biomass was also correlated with salinity close to the bottom, suggesting a link between suprabenthos, abundance and changes in the oceanographic condition of water masses close to the bottom. It is suggested that a higher suprabenthos biomass recorded off Soller in comparison to that off Cabrera in June could, in turn, be related to a seasonal inflow of Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) in April-June in this area at mid bathyal depths (350-650 m). This trend would be based on: 1) it was evident only at mid-slope depths between 350-750 m, coinciding with the LIW distribution, and 2) it was not recorded among zooplankton (collected throughout the water column). The possible effect of the fluctuations of suprabenthos and zooplankton on higher trophic levels has been explored studying the diet and food consumption rates of the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus, as indicator species by its dominance in bathyal communities. A. antennatus increased its food consumption from February to April-June 2004 off Soller, which in the case of large (CL > 40 mm) specimens was found in both areas. In addition, there was a shift of diet from winter to spring-early summer. In this last period, A. antennatus preyed upon euphausiids and mesopelagic decapods and fish, while benthos (e.g. polychaetes and bivalves) decreased in the diet. This indicates an increase in the food consumption and probably in the caloric content of the diet in pre-spawning females in April-June 2004, which is synchronized with the period when gonad development begins in A. antennatus females (May-June).
   Anyway, macrozooplankton, and not suprabenthos, is crucialas a high energetic food source in the coupling between food intake and reproduction in the red shrimp. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The Farm Aquaculture Resource Management (FARM) model has been applied to several shellfish species and aquaculture types. The performance of the FARM model, developed to simulate potential harvest, key financial data, and water quality impacts at the farm-scale, was tested in five systems in the European Union: Loch Cretan, Scotland (Pacific oyster), Pertuis Breton, France (blue mussel), Bay of Piran, Slovenia (Mediterranean mussel), Chioggia, Italy (Mediterranean mussel) and Ria Formosa, Portugal (Manila clam). These systems range from open coasts to estuaries, and are used for shellfish aquaculture by means of different cultivation techniques (e.g. oyster bottom culture in Loch Cretan and mussel longlines and poles in Pertuis Breton).
   The drivers for the FARM model were supplied by measured data, outputs of system-scale models or a combination of both. The results (given in total fresh weight) generally show good agreement with reported annual production (shown in brackets) at each farm: simulated production of 134 tons of Pacific oyster in Loch Cretan (150 tons, -10%), 2691 tons of blue mussel in Pertuis Breton (2304 tons, +17%), 314 tons of Mediterranean mussel in the Bay of Piran (200 tons, +57%), 545 tons of Mediterranean mussel in Chioggia (660 tons, -17%) and 119 tons of Manila clam in Ria Formosa (104 tons, +15%).
   The nitrogen mass balance for each farm was also determined with the FARM model. The net removal of nitrogen (N) by the farms was estimated to correspond to 1206 population equivalents per year (PEQ y(-1)) in Loch Cretan, 93503 PEQ y(-1) in Pertuis Breton, 9196 PEQ y(-1) in the Bay of Piran, 97916 PEQ y(-1) in Chioggia and 8613 PEQ y(-1) in Ria Formosa. The aggregate income due to both the shellfish sale and substitution value of land-based fertilizer reduction or nutrient treatment was estimated to be about 700 k(sic)y(-1) in Loch Cretan, 30,706 k(sic)y(-1) in Pertuis Breton, 3000 k(sic)y(-1) in the Bay of Piran, 30,000 k(sic)y(-1) in Chioggia, and 5000 k(sic)y(-1) in Ria Formosa. Outputs of FARM may be used to analyse the farm production potential and profit maximization according to seeding densities and/or spatial distribution. Results of a marginal analysis for all the study sites were determined. As an example, profit maximization in Loch Cretan was obtained with 97 tons of seed, resulting in a total production of 440 tons (profit of 2100 k(sic) for a culture period of about 2 years).
   FARM additionally integrates the well-known ASSETS model, for assessment of farm-related eutrophication impacts. The assessment results for the five study sites show that water quality is either maintained or improved in all farms under standard conditions of culture practice.
   FARM results may be used by farmers to analyse farm production potential and by managers for environmental assessment of farm-related water quality impacts, whether positive or negative. It is a useful tool for all stakeholders for the valuation of nitrogen credits, which may be traded as part of an integrated catchment management plan.
   The FARM results were scaled up to determine a net value of 11-17 billion (sic)y(-1) of ecosystem goods and services, provided by shellfish culture towards reducing eutrophication in the coastal waters of the European Union. These numbers highlight the role that extractive organic aquaculture plays in integrated coastal zone and nutrient emissions management. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pyrolysis experiments were conducted on immature petroleum source rocks under various conditions to evaluate the role of water in petroleum formation. At temperatures less than 330 degrees C for 72 h, the thermal decomposition of kerogen to bitumen was not significantly affected by the presence or absence of liquid water in contact with heated gravel-sized source rock. However, at 330 and 350 degrees C for 72 h, the thermal decomposition of generated bitumen was significantly affected by the presence or absence of liquid water. Carbon-carbon bond cross linking resulting in the formation of an insoluble bitumen (i.e., pyrobitumen) is the dominant reaction pathway in the absence of liquid water. Conversely, thermal cracking of carbon-carbon bonds resulting in the generation of saturate-enriched oil, which is similar to natural crude oils, is the dominant reaction pathway in the presence of liquid water. This difference in reaction pathways is explained by the availability of an exogenous source of hydrogen, which reduces the rate of thermal decomposition, promotes thermal cracking, and inhibits carbon-carbon bond cross linking. The distribution of generated n-alkanes is characteristic of a free radical mechanism, with a broad carbon-number distribution (i.e., C-5 to C-35) and only minor branched alkanes from known biological precursors (i.e., pristane and phytane). The generation of excess oxygen in the form of CO2 in hydrous experiments and the high degree of hydrocarbon deuteration in a D2O experiment indicate that water dissolved in the bitumen is an exogenous source of hydrogen. The lack of an effect on product composition and yield with an increase in H+ activity by five orders of magnitude in a hydrous experiment indicates that an ionic mechanism for water interactions with thermally decomposing bitumen is not likely. Several mechanistically simple and thermodynamically favorable reactions that are consistent with the available experimental data are envisaged for the generation of exogenous hydrogen and excess oxygen as CO2. One reaction series involves water oxidizing existing carbonyl groups to form hydrogen and carboxyl groups, with the latter forming CO2 by decarboxylation with increasing thermal stress. Another reaction series involves either hydrogen or oxygen in dissolved water molecules directly interacting with unpaired electrons to form a hydrogen-terminated free-radical site or an oxygenated functional group, respectively. The latter is expected to be susceptible to oxidation by other dissolved water molecules to generate additional hydrogen and CO2. In addition to water acting as an exogenous source of hydrogen, it is also essential to the generation of an expelled saturate-enriched oil that is similar to natural crude oil. This role of water is demonstrated by the lack of an expelled oil in an experiment where a liquid Ga-In alloy is substituted for liquid water. Experiments conducted with high salinity water and high water/rock ratios indicate that selective aqueous solubility of hydrocarbons is not responsible for the expelled oil generated in hydrous pyrolysis experiments. Similarly, a hydrous pyrolysis experiment conducted with isolated kerogen indicates that expelled oil in hydrous pyrolysis is not the result of preferential sorption of polar organic components by the mineral matrix of a source rock. It is envisaged that dissolved water in the bitumen network of a source rock causes an immiscible saturate-enriched oil to become immiscible with the thermally decomposing polar-enriched bitumen.
   The overall geochemical implication of these results is that it is essential to consider the role of water in experimental studies designed to understand natural rates of petroleum generation, expulsion mechanisms of primary migration, thermal stability of crude oil, reaction kinetics of biomarker transformations, and thermal maturity indicators in sedimentary basins.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to design a research model and analyze the relationship between open innovation and cleaner production. The paper maps and characterizes the conditions of open innovation against cleaner production in Indonesian batik small and medium enterprise (SME), particularly in Java and Madura. The mapping process is executed by classifying the batik SME into four quadrants. The diagram is a quadrant in which there are four parts to distinguish each of the ability of batik SMEs in understanding and achieving cleaner production through open innovation. This research will obtain a new method or model that can be applied by organizations to achieve cleaner production through an open innovation. The data is obtained from 182 batik SMEs located in Laweyan, Madura and Lasem (in Java Island, Indonesia). Design/methodology/approach One of the problems in batik SME is the waste management from the dyeing and wax removal process. In the first stages of this research, a number of initial models were elaborated as a reference, then the results of the elaboration became a new research model. The research model that has been produced is then tested using data from respondents. Based on the test results, the model can be stated valid or not. In this study, the model is valid after testing data from 182 respondents, because all outer loading for all indicators is above 0.7. The composite reliability and AVE values of all constructs were above 0.7 and 0.5. Based on the validated research model, the data is statistically processed by using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). By using the SEM method and statistical software SMART PLS 3.0this research can be supported to achieve the research objectives. Findings Based on data testing and processing, open innovation climate could predict a sustained relationship to open innovation with an accuracy rate of 0.466 and influence rate of 0.427, whereas open innovation could predict a sustained relationship to cleaner production with an accuracy rate of 0.183 and influence rate of 0.324. The relationships between open innovation climate and open innovation; including open innovation toward cleaner production, are statistically significant because all prediction values and accuracy in the model have met the criteria for measurement parameters based on the value of R-2, p value and T-statistics to be stated as a significant relationship. Research limitations/implications This research provides an overview of the influence and importance of open innovation in creating an environmentally friendly production process in the context of cleaner production. Cleaner production on batik SMEs can be achieved through open innovation, both for inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Open innovation comprehensively provides support for batik SMEs in achieving cleaner production. Open innovation can be run well and optimally if it gets support from a conducive climate open innovation. Furthermore, the implementation of cleaner production could be a guideline for the owner to minimize the waste from batik SME production, both for natural and synthetic dyes.
   Some limitations in these study include the absence of influence from the existing stakeholders on batik SMEs on the implementation process of open innovation; the use of the cross-sectional approach that results in the unavailability of further analysis regarding the dynamics or improvements that occur in attaining cleaner production through open innovation; and finally providing no analysis of the differences in characteristics at each location of batik SMEs.
   Originality/value The implementation of cleaner production model is considered as one of the new methods and references in conjunction with reducing the negative impact of waste toward the environment, particularly in the traditional textile industry which is limited in waste management capability.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. The German DIN 19730 (1,997) describes a method for the extraction of readily available trace elements from soil by shaking the soil with 1 M NH4NO3-solution. Based on this method trigger and action values for the transfer of heavy metals and arsenic from soils to plants have been published in the German Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance (BBodSchV 1.999). The chemical mechanisms involved in this soil extraction procedure were evaluated in some detail to create requirements to improve environmental risk assessment for soil contaminations.
   Methods. The chemical mechanisms involved when soil is extracted with 1 M NH4NO3-solution were evaluated. This was followed by a laboratory experiment to quantify the formation of soluble metal ammine complexes during the extraction. Cd, Zn, Ni, Cu, Co and Hg were extracted from 16 soils by 1 M NH4NO3, 1 M KNO3 and water. pH was adjusted in 5 steps between 5.0 to 7.5. The potassium cation (K+) and the ammonium cation (NH4+) behave similarly when cations from soil surfaces are desorbed, because they have almost identical ion radii (e.g. 0.133 and 0.143 nm). K, does not form ammine complexes with other ions, whereas, due to the increasing formation of NH3 from NH4 by dissociation with rising pH, metal ammine complex formation is an important process in soil extraction when using ammonium salt solutions. A difference in the extraction efficiency of 1 M NH4NO3- and 1 M KNO3-solution for a given soil can therefore be attributed to the formation of soluble metal ammine complexes.
   Conclusion. Our experiments resulted in considerably higher extraction rates of Cu, Cd and Hg by 1 M NH4NO3-solution as compared to 1 M KNO3-solution. This effect, caused by the formation of soluble metal ammine complexes, was only evident in soils with higher readily soluble heavy metal contents and a soil pH above 6-6.5 for Cu and 7-7.5 for Cd. Further chemical mechanisms involved when soils are extracted with 1 M NH4NO3 are a moderate decrease in pH and an increase in ionic strength. Most of the colloids and parts of soluble metal-organic complexes are precipitated due to the high ionic strength. High ionic strength also decreases the activity of metal-OH+ species and the electrostatic potential of the particle surfaces, which in turn, increases the desorption of heavy metal cations from negatively charged soil surfaces. In contrast, the adsorption of anions like arsenate is favoured by the decreasing electrostatic potential.
   The prediction of heavy metal uptake by plants from the results of the 1 M NH4NO3-solution extraction fits well for elements, which are mainly bound by low strength electrostatic forces to the soils. Such conditions are found in acidic soils for Cd and Tl, which have a low tendency for hydrolysis compared to other heavy metals. The correlation between 1 M NH4NO3 soil extraction and plant uptake is less significant for Ni and Zn. Only low positive correlation coefficients have been found for Pb, As, Hg and for the Cu-uptake by wheat. Imprecise prediction of plant uptake of heavy metals by the extraction with 1 M NH4NO3-solution is mainly caused by conditions leading to an overestimation of plant availability such as elements are strongly bound to soils, or low soluble trace element contents in soils. Neutral to alkaline soil pH can also lead to imprecise prediction due to increasing formation of soluble metal-organic (Cu, Pb, Hg) and metal ammine (Hg, Cu, Cd) complexes and less importantly due to the formation of colloids. Therefore, at low 1 M NH4NO3-extractabte soil contents usually no high plant contents are to be expected.
   Recommendation and Outlook. Extraction of soil with 1 M NH4NO3-solution is a suitable method for the determination of readily soluble and plant available trace element contents. The chemical soil extraction process may cause misleading predictions of the transfer of trace elements to plants for some soil properties. This knowledge should be used to improve risk assessment of soil contaminations. It has to be considered, that the processes involved in plant uptake of trace elements are too complex to expect that just one soil extraction method can always guarantee a correct prognosis of toxicological significant element contents in plants. Soil analyses may be used for the preliminary examination of suspicious areas and the demarcation of contaminated areas. The results of soil analyses should be checked additionally by plant analyses especially under conditions with a high probability for misleading results by the 1 M NH4NO3-extraction. Alternatively, extraction with 1 M KNO3-solution can be performed to exclude the effect of metal ammine complex formation.

AB  - Common beech (Fagus sylvatica) forms a strong vegetation belt in the sub-alpine region of the Croatian Dinaric range, with natural forests of common spruce (Picea abies) occurring as azonal communities in some specific localities of this belt. The association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum Vukelic, Alegro et Segota 2010 inhabits sinkholes and northern, colder and shadier slopes from 1,100 to 1,400 m above the sea, while shady and open ridges and peaks above 1,400 177 are occupied by the spruce forest described by S. Bertovic (1975) under the name of Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum dinaricum Bertovic 1975. Bertovic's name of the association is illegitimate (articles 31 and 34a, International Code of Phytocoeno-logical Nomenclature - ICPN, Weber, Moravec and Theurillat 2000) since the name was already used by Schweingruber in 1972 for an association in the Randalpen in Switzerland. One of the objectives of this research was to revise the nomenclature and propose a new name for the phytocoenosis (Hyperico grisebachii-Piceetum), as well as define the diagnostic species and other features. We used a method of the Zurich-Montpellier Phytocoenological School with a six-degree scale. The floral composition was classified according to the social affiliation of the species. The plant nomenclature was adjusted to the Flora Croatia database (Nikolic 2010), while mosses were adjusted according to Koperski et al. (2000).
   The association Hyperico grisebachii-Piceetum is distributed above an altitude of 1,400 m (slightly lower on Samarske Stijene). It grows on distinctly rocky peaks, ridges, hooks, karrens, and upper steep and sun-exposed slopes. The sites of this association are basically characterized by the rockiness of the terrain, which almost always exceeds 40 %. This contributes significantly to the broken tree canopy layer and to the composition of shrubs and ground vegetation (Figure 1). The soils mostly consist of different subtypes of calcomelanosol, from organogenie, over organomineral to browned soils, and less frequently of shallow calcocambisol (Baksic et al. 2010). According to the macroclimatic features of the Zavizan set, the average annual temperature is 3.5 degrees C and the average annual precipitation amount is 1,898 nun (Vucjak meteorological station on Northern Velebit - 1,594 in, period 1061 - 1990). The ecological amplitude of the occurrence of the community is very narrow whereas the specific relief pedological and climatic conditions are unfavourable for the successful growth of forest vegetation.
   Ten phytocoenological releves (Table 1, releves 1 - 6, Zavizan area; 7 and 8, Smrceve Doline area; 9 and 10, Samarske Stijene area) contain 153 species of higher plants and 31 moss species. The interruptea' tree layer is completely dominated by spruce, while the shrub layer in addition to the species from the tree layer contains further 18 species. Lonicera caerulea the. subsp. borbasiana, Clematis alpina, Vaccinium myrtillus, Rosa pendulina, Salix appendiculata, Rubus idaeus, Sambucus racemosa and Juniperus communis subsp. alpina feature in more than two thirds of the releves. From the sociological standpoint, there is a prevalence of so-called "picetal" (spruce) species, characteristic for spruce forests of the major part of Europe. Together with mosses, there are 38 such species in all. They are decisive for the sin-systematic position of the association and their participation is higher than in the marginal phytocoenosis Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The species Calamagrostis varia, Cirsium erysithales, and even Carex ornithopoda, which belong to the order Erico-Pinetalia, deserve special mention in terms of participation and cover Of other higher categories, the order Fagetalia Pawl. 1928 and lower categories consist of 31 species, of which 7 occur in over 40 % of the releves. The alliance Adenostylion Br.-Bl. 1925 and the order Adenostyletalia G. & J. Br.-Bl. 1931 are represented by 17 species, with 5 species occurring in over 40 % of the releves. The species of these syntaxa occur in a considerably lesser amount than is the case with the phytocoenosis Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum mentioned above.
   The comparison of the newly-nominated phytocoenosis Hyperico grisebachii-Piceetum with Shwaingmber's Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum shows big differences, as well as their absolute independence. Over thirty species from the Dinaric Alps (e.g. Salix appendiculata, Sambucus racemosa, Lonicera caerulea subsp. borbasiana, Festuca bosniaca, Hypericum richeri subsp. grisebachii, Cardus acanthoides, Geranium macrorrhizum, Achillea clavene, Gentiana lutea subsp. symphyandra, Ribes alpinum and many others) are missing from stands of spruce forest with small-reed in the Austrian Alps (Willner and Grabherr 2007, columns 7 and 8, Table 34). On the other hand, these stands contain more than 100 species which were not recorded in the Dinaric association. Of these species, Larix decidua, Pinus sylvestris, Polygala chamaebuxus, Sesleria albicans, Homogyne alpina, Carex alba, Hepatica nobilis, Erica carnea, Campanula cochleariifolia, Ranunculus nemorosus and others are particularly prominent in terms of occurrence or participation. The investigated spruce association differs from subalpine spruce forests growing in Slovenia (Zupancic 1999) and in other Dinaric regions (Vukelic, Alegro and Segota 2010).
   To select diagnostic species of the association, we compared ten releves from Table 1 and used the results of research into the forest vegetation of south-eastern Europe, primarily that of Fukarek (1964), Stefanovic (1970), Zupancic (1980, 1999), Zupancic and Acceto (1994), Vukelic, Alegro and Segota (2010) and other phytocoenologists. Special mention should be made of a broader group of differentiating species which characterize the subalpine, open-canopy rocky sites and which either do not occur in other spruce communities or are present to a much lesser degree. These include in the first place Juniperus communis subsp. alpina, Salix apendicullata, Sambucus racemosa, Hypericum richeri subsp. grisebachii, Achillea clavenae, Gentiana lutea subsp. symphyandra, than Festuca bosniaca, Cardus acanthoides, Carlina acaulis subsp. caulescens, Asplenium fissum, Melampyrum velebiticum and others. Not all of them are primarily forest species; the sites of this spruce forest are frequently interspersed with mountain clearings and massive blocks whose cracks are inhabited by these species. In relation to other spruce forests in Croatia and wider, there is also a group of forest species with high participation and cover that includes Calamagrostis varia, Polystychum lonchitis, Adenostyles alpina and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. These species play an important role in the identification and differentiation of this association, although they cannot be determined as differentiating since they are also present in other Dinaric phytocoenoses.
   St John's wort, Hypericum richeri Vill. subsp. grisebachii (Boiss.) Nyman, proved to be the most suitable species for nominating the association. Its participation and amounts are much higher than in the related phytocoenoses, while its eco-indicator properties are ideally suited to the site conditions of the association. Moreover, it has not been used in the nomination of common spruce communities. In forest communities of Croatia, Hypericum richeri subsp. grisebachii is found in mugo pine stands and in the investigated spruce association. Regardless of the same sin-systematic affiliation, these two associations differ profoundly.
   Based on the above, the valid name of the analyzed association is Hyperico grisebachii-Piceetum abietis (Bertovic 1975) nom. nov. hoc loco. We propose Bertovic 's releve No 5 in Table 17 (Bertovic 1975, p. 34) to be the nomenclatural type (lectotypus hoc loco), This will solve the problem of the name and independent status of the association. In the syntaxonomic sense, it belongs to the alliance Vaccinio-Piceion, order Vaccinio-Piceetalia and class Vaccinio-Piceetea.
   The phytocoenosis does not have any commercial importance, but is of high protective and natural-scientific significance. The most important stands are found in North Velebit National Park, but the association also occurs sporadically in Samarske Stijene on Bjelolasica and in the Smrekovac area in the Risnjak massif The composition of the phytocoenosis is not uniform across the entire distribution range. The high ridges on which it grows are relatively distant enclaves with their specific geobotanical and horological features.

AB  - The Motreal Protocol was developed in 1987 in response to concerns that the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were releasing chlorine into the stratosphere and that this chlorine was causing a depletion of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica. This international agreement called for a phase out of these CFCs. Industry initiated a major effort to find replacements that are safe when properly used and safe to the environment. The toxicology and environmental fate of these first generation replacements has been studied extensively.
   It was determined that the new substances break down in the environment to give predominantly carbon dioxide, water and inorganic salts of chlorine and fluorine. The only exception is that some substances also break down to yield trifluoroacetic acid (HTFA), a substance resistant to further degradation. Recognizing this, industry embarked on a research and assessment program to study the potential effects of trifluoroacetate (TFA) on the environment and to investigate possible degradation pathways. The results of these recently completed studies are summarized below and described in further detail in this paper.
   Trifluoroacetic acid is a strong organic acid with a pKa of 0.23. It is miscible with water and its low octanol/water partition coefficient (log P-ow = -2.1) indicates no potential to bioaccumulate.
   Industrial use is limited and environmental releases are very low. Some additional TFA will be formed from the breakdown of a few halogenated hydrocarbons, most notably HFC-134a (CF3CH2F), HCFC-124 (CF3CHFCl), and HCFC-123 (CF3CHCl2). As these substances have only been produced in limited commercial quantities, their contribution to environmental levels has been minimal. Surprisingly, environmental measurements in many of diverse locations show existing levels of 100 to 300 ng.l(-1) in water with one site (Dead Sea) having a level of 6400 ng.l(-1). These levels cannot be accounted for based on current atmospheric sources and imply a long-term, possibly pre-industrial source. Generally, soil retention of TFA is poor although soils with high levels of organic matter have been shown to have a greater affinity for TFA when contrasted to soils with low levels of organic matter. This appears to be an adsorption phenomenon, not irreversible binding. Therefore, TFA will not be retained in soil, but will ultimately enter the aqueous compartment.
   Modeling of emission rates and subsequent conversion rates for precursors has led to estimates of maximum levels of TFA in rain water in the region of 0.1 mu g.l(-1) in the year 2020.
   TFA is resistant to both oxidative and reductive degradation. While there had been speculation regarding the possibility of TFA being degraded into monofluoroacetic acid (MFA), the rate of breakdown of MFA is so much higher than for TFA that any MFA formed would rapidly degrade. Therefore, there would be no buildup of MFA regardless of die levels of TFA present in the environment.
   Although highly resistant to microbial degradation, there have been two reports of TFA degradation under anaerobic conditions. In the first study, natural sediments reduced TFA. However, even though this work was done in replicate, the investigators and others were unable to reproduce it in subsequent studies. In the second study, radiolabeled TFA was removed from a mixed anaerobic in vitro microcosm. Limited evidence of decarboxylation has also been reported for two strains of bacteria grown under highly specific conditions. TFA was not biodegraded in a semi-continuous activated sludge test even with prolonged incubation (up to 84 days).
   TFA does not accumulate significantly in lower aquatic life forms such as bacteria, small invertebrates, oligochaete worms and some aquatic plants including Lemna gibba (duckweed). Some bioaccumulation was observed in terrestrial higher plants, such as sunflower and wheat. This result appeared to be related to uptake with water and then concentration due to transpiration water loss. When transferred to clean hydroponic media, some elimination of TFA was seen. Also, more than 80% of the TFA in leaves was found to be water extractable, suggesting that no significant metabolism of TFA had occurred.
   At an exposure level of 1200 mg.l(-1) of sodium trifluoroacetate (NaTFA) corresponding to 1000 mg.l(-1) HTFA - no effects were seen on either Brachydanio rerio (a fish) or Daphnia magna (a water flea). With duckweed, mild effects were seen on frond increase and weight increase at the same exposure level. At a concentration of 300 mg.l(-1) no effects were observed. Toxicity tests were conducted with 11 species of algae. For ten of these species the EC50 was greater than 100 mg.l(-1). In Selenastrum capricornutum the no-effect level was 0.12 mg.l(-1). At higher levels the effect was reversible. The reason for the unique sensitivity of this strain is unknown, but a recovery of the growth rate was seen when citric acid was added. This could imply a competitive inhibition of the citric acid cycle.
   The effect of TFA on seed germination and plant growth has been evaluated with a wide variety of plants. Application of NaTFA at 1000 mg.l(-1) to seeds of sunflower, cabbage, lettuce, tomato, mung bean, soy bean, wheat, corn, oats and rice did not affect germination. Foliar application of a solution of 100 mg.l(-1) of NaTFA to field grown plants did not affect growth of sunflower, soya, wheat, maize, oilseed rape, rice and plantain. When plantain, wheat (varieties Katepwa acid Hanno) and soya were grown in hydroponic systems containing NaTFA, no effects were seen on plantain at 32 mg.l(-1), on wheat (Katepwa) and soya at 1 mg.l(-1), or on wheat (Hanno) at 10 mg.l(-1); some effects on growth were seen at, respectively, 100 mg.l(-1), 5 mg.l(-1), 5 mg.l(-1), and 10 mg.l(-1) and above.
   TFA is not metabolized in mammalian systems to any great extent. It is the major final metabolite of halothane, HCFC-123 and HCFC-124, The half-life of TFA in humans is 16 hours. As expected, the acute oral toxicity of the free acid is higher than the one of the sodium salt. The inhalation LC50 (2 hour exposure) for mice was 13.5 mg.l(-1) (2900 ppm) and for rats it was 10 mg.l(-1) (2140 ppm). Thus,TFA is considered to have low inhalation toxicity. The irritation threshold for humans was 54 ppm.
   As one would expect of a strong acid, it is a severe irritant to the skin and eye, When conjugated with protein, it has been shown to elicit an immunological reaction; however, it is unlikely that TFA itself would elicit a sensitization response. Repeat administration of aqueous solutions have shown that TFA can cause increased liver weight and induction of peroxisomes. Relative to the doses (0.5% in diet or 150 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) by gavage) the effects are mild.
   In a series of Ames assays, TFA was reported to be non-mutagenic. Its carcinogenic potential has not been evaluated. Although TFA was shown to accumulate in amniotic fluid following exposure of pregnant animals to high levels of halothane (1200 ppm), no fetal effects were seen. Likewise, a reproduction study that involved exposure of animals to halothane at levels up to 4000 ppm for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week, resulted in no adverse effects. Given the high levels of halothane exposure, it is unlikely that environmental TFA is a reproductive or developmental hazard.
   Overall the toxicity of TFA has been evaluated in stream mesocosms, algae, higher plants, fish, animals and humans. It has been found to be of very low toxicity in all of these systems. The lowest threshold for any effects was the reversible effect on growth of one strain of algae, Selenastrum capricornutum, which was seen at 0.12 mg.l(-1). There is a 1000-fold difference between the no-effect concentration and the projected environmental levels of TFA from HFCs and HCFCs (0.0001 mg.l(-1)). Based on available data, one can conclude that environmental levels of TFA resulting from the breakdown of alternative fluorocarbons do not pose a threat to the environment.

AB  - The offshore wind power-photovoltaic-hydrogen storage (OWPH) system has been considerably valued due to its advantages in improving power quality and increasing the absorption capacity of renewable energy power generation. To promote the rapid development and smooth implementation of the OWPH system, constructing a scientific investment decision-making framework is of utmost significance. Firstly, a criteria system that includes economy, resource, environment and support conditions, is established, where probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements are introduced to depict the quantitative indicators and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets are employed by decision-makers to evaluate qualitative indicators. Then, a relative-entropy-based model is built to calculate the importance of decision-makers and a weighting model combining probabilistic linguistic-DEMATEL with the idea of maximizing deviation method is also built to compute the criteria weights. Moreover, an S-shaped utilitybased PROMETHEE method is proposed to determine the optimal investment alternative(s). Finally, the proposed framework is applied in a case study to certificate the feasibility. The results illustrate that scheme A2 possesses the optimal comprehensive performance and the ranking order may vary with the change of decisionmakers' risk attitudes. This research provides investors with scientific decision reference and also extend the methods in the decision-making field.

AB  - Changing oceanic conditions are having impacts on living marine resources (LMRs) and their management, often in ways beyond what we have ever seen before. This is largely manifested as changes in production or location of these LMRs. The challenge has been not only to disentangle the possible causes of these changes to LMRstocks, but then even if clear changes are detected, it has been unclear what we can actually do about them. Here, we propose a set of recommended actions or "business rules" to better address climate-induced changes to LMR production and location. These emphasize a series of diagnostics which can be used to demarcate significance of whether action is necessary, and then if action is deemed necessary, we propose a set of insertion points or "on-ramps" to address the nuances of locational or production changes at every step in the science to management process. These proposed "business rules" for dealing with climate-induced changes to fisheries can always be debated, can always be updated with new information, and can always be adjusted under a given set of circumstances. But, we also assert that it would be wise to start acting on them, as a proposed set of options, given the urgency and exigency of the situation.

AB  - The ecology and species diversity of ephemeral wetland vegetation have been fairly well studied, but the biology of its characteristic species has rarely been investigated holistically. Here we combine previous results on the genetic diversity of a suitable model species (the diploid Cyperus fuscus) with new data on its historical and recent occurrence, its ecological and climatic niche, and the associated vegetation. Analysis of phytosociological releves from Central Europe revealed a broad ecological niche of C. fuscus with an optimum in the Isoeto-Nanojuncetea class, extending to several other vegetation types. Overall species composition in the releves highlight C. fuscus as a potential indicator of habitat conditions suitable for a range of other threatened taxa. Analysis of historical records of C. fuscus from the Czech Republic showed an increasing trend in the number of localities since the 1990s. It seems that recent climate warming allows the thermophilous C. fuscus to expand its range into colder regions. Isoeto-Nanojuncetea and Bidentetea species are well represented in the soil seed bank in both riverine and anthropogenic habitats of C. fuscus. Vegetation diversity has a weak negative effect and anthropogenic (compared to riverine) habitats have a strong negative effect on genetic diversity in this species.

AB  - Burning of sugarcane residues has been associated with several environmental and human health problems. In order to alleviate these problems and maintain sustainability of the system, sugarcane industries have started to adopt a mechanized method of harvesting that does not include burning of the residue. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the conversion of burnt to unburnt sugarcane harvesting systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and soil organic matter (SOM) compartments of the northeastern region of Brazil. The study was carried out in two sugarcane mills in the state of Alagoas. In each farm, chronosequences or comparison pairs were selected, totaling seven areas (three burnt and four unburnt). The unburnt system in the conditions of the northeastern region of Brazil accumulated carbon (C) in the soil at rates similar to those found in the south-central region of Brazil (2.00 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Therefore, the results obtained contribute to consolidating the results of other studies and reinforce the potential of the unburnt system to promote the soil C sequestration, which is important considering the area cultivated with sugarcane. Under the qualitative point of view, the unburnt systems resulted in lower values of soil bulk density and higher values of SOC stocks, fulvic and humic acids, and also of C fractions with greater stability, which are positive indicators that this type of system is gradually improving the quality of the soils.

AB  - The Bacanga River Estuary is socioeconomically important due to artisanal fishing and aquaculture. It is blocked by a dam and is under human pressure along its drainage basin, intensifying the eutrophication process. This study reports on the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms and trophic state ( TSI and TRIX) at six sampling sites during the annual cycle. The estuary was divided into downstream and upstream regions. Higher salinity, turbidity, depth, and lower dissolved oxygen levels were found downstream; whereas, high levels of chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations were observed in both regions. There were blooms of Leptocylindrus danicus (1.45 x 10(6) cells L-1) and Skeletonema costatum (1.89 x 10(6) cells L-1) downstream; whereas phytoflagellate proliferation, such as those of Chlamydomonas sp. (13.17 x 10(6) cells L-1), Euglena gracilis (7.84 x 10(6) cells L-1), and Euglena proxima (1.03 x 10(6) cells L-1) were recorded upstream, with Chlamydomonas sp. as the discriminant species of this zone. Both trophic indices (TSI; TRIX) indicated elevated trophic conditions for the estuary, classifying it as hypereutrophic. Nevertheless, TSI only showed a significant relationship with some specific phytoplankton blooms. Thus, TSI seems to be the trophic index with a better response in the assessment of estuarine ecological functioning.

AB  - In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association initiated the safety re-evaluation of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavor ingredients. This publication, 4th in a series focusing on the safety evaluation of NFCs, presents an evaluation of NFCs rich in hydroxyallylbenzene and hydroxypropenylbenzene constituents using a procedure initially published in 2005 and updated in 2018 that evaluates the safety of naturally occurring mixtures for their intended use as flavoring ingredients. The procedure requires the characterization of the chemical composition for each NFC and subsequent organization of the constituents into defined congeneric groups. The safety of each NFC is evaluated using the conservative threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach together with studies on absorption, metabolism and toxicology of the NFC and its constituent congeneric groups. By the application of this procedure, seven NFCs, derived from clove, cinnamon leaf and West Indian bay leaf were affirmed as "generally recognized as safe (GRAS)" under their conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients. An eighth NFC, an oleoresin of West Indian bay leaf, was affirmed based on its estimated intake, which is below the TTC of 0.15 mu g/person per day for compounds with structural alerts for genotoxicity.

AB  - This paper develops a theoretical framework containing the methodology for assessing resilience of the ATC (Air Traffic Control) sectors affected by the impact of a given disruptive event. The resilience is considered as ability of these sectors to retain a certain level of the regular/nominal performance during the impact and fully recover relatively fast afterwards. The actually rear disruptive event is considered to be the large-scale failure of a component of the ATC facilities and equipment supporting safe, efficient, and effective air traffic. Under such conditions, different mitigating contingency measures are generally applied resulting in deteriorating the operational, economic, and environmental performance of the affected sectors while maintaining the required level of safety. This performance is represented by the indicators such as demand, capacity, traffic complexity, the ATC controller workload, aircraft/flight delays and their costs, and additional fuel consumption and related emissions of GHG (Green House Gases). The proposed methodology consists of the generic model of resilience, the analytical models for estimating the indictors of ATC sectors' performance, and the analytical models of resilience based the indicators as figures-of-merit for assessing resilience. These models are based on the practice-close mitigating contingency measures applied to the ATC sectors affected by a given disruptive event. The possible application of the proposed methodology is also elaborated.

AB  - BACKGROUND The weakest link in the whole cycle of chemical quality testing of sweet potato tubers for both food and feed purposes, where the main determinant of their nutritional value is the level of protein and its nutritional value, is the effect of nitrogen fertilization. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the effect of differentiated nitrogen fertilization on protein content and its amino acid composition, biological value, and the possibility of modification of these features.
   RESULTS Changes in total nitrogen content in sweet potato tubers were accompanied by changes in amino acid composition of protein. The consequence of intensified nitrogen fertilization was a decrease in the sum of exogenous amino acids and sum of endogenous amino acids. The amino acid limiting the biological value of sweet potato protein was mainly lysine, followed by arginine and methionine. The ratio of essential to total amino acids indicated high usefulness of sweet potato tubers in human nutrition and their high nutritional value.
   CONCLUSION The consequence of nitrogen fertilization was a decrease in the sum of exogenous amino acids and the sum of endogenous amino acids. Fertilization of sweet potato with a nitrogen dose of 100 kg ha(-1), due to the content of crude and true protein, turned out to be beneficial and sufficient under the conditions in central-eastern Europe.

AB  - To compare the effect of eucalyptus extract and formaldehyde gas on the hatchability, survival rate, and microbial load of embryos and biological biomarkers of embryos in the fertile eggs of broiler chicken, 120 fertile eggs were divided into four groups (each group contained 30 eggs). The studied groups included the first and second groups in which eucalyptus extract at concentrations of respectively 1.100 and 1.200 was used as a disinfectant, the third group in which formaldehyde gas was used as a disinfectant and the fourth group as a negative control in which the studied eggs were sprayed with distilled sterilized water without using any disinfectant. All eggs were kept in a standard incubation system and the hatching rate was determined after 21 days. The hatched embryos were cultured to identify infection with E. coli. The hatched chickens were monitored for one week, and survival rate and the amount of using grain, overweight, and food conversion ratios were studied in different groups. The results showed that the disinfection of fertile egg with eucalyptus extract at the concentration of 1.200 was similar to that of formaldehyde, while the eucalyptus extract at the concentration of 1.100 can increase the hatching rate and the growth indicators. Therefore, it seems that using eucalyptus extract in the appropriate conditions and concentrations can be an appropriate alternative for formaldehyde.

AB  - Heterogeneous environments can create differential selection pressures among populations, which may result in the evolution of local adaptations. Premating isolation mechanisms may emerge due to limited movement among locally adapted individuals, thus further enhancing such adaptations. The song of male songbirds is one potential premating isolation mechanism that has long been of interest because of its implications for mate choice, local adaptation, and speciation associated with environmental heterogeneity. We tested whether locally adapted mountain chickadees exhibit variation in song structure along an elevation gradient and whether song structure shifts with the distinct change in winter climate severity around the snowline. These birds exhibit large elevation-related differences in numerous behavioral and neurological traits, including variation in spatial cognition associated with fitness consequences. We recorded song along two continuous elevation gradients and detected significant differences among the sampling sites along an elevation gradient and between "high" and "low" elevation songs. Our current results, coupled with previously reported winter climate-related differences are generally consistent with the local adaptation hypothesis explaining geographic variation in song, which suggests that variation in song structure could serve as an indicator of local adaptation. Our study shows that song differences can evolve on a small spatial scale along a continuous species distribution when there is a rapid change in environmental conditions also favoring the evolution of local adaptations.

AB  - We investigated 34 sediment cores to reconstruct spatiotemporal variations in hypolimnetic hypoxia for the past 200 years in Lehmilampi, a small lake in Eastern Finland. As hypoxia is essential for varve preservation, spatiotemporal changes in varve distribution were used as an indicator for hypolimnetic hypoxia oscillations. The hypoxic water volume was used as a variable reflecting hypolimnetic hypoxia and determined for each year by estimating the water volume beneath the water depth where shallowest varves were preserved. As a result, seven hypoxia periods, highlighting the variations in hypolimnetic hypoxia, are established. These periods may be influenced by bioturbation, lake infill, and lake level changes. Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between hypolimnetic hypoxia oscillations and climatic factors. Diatom assemblage changes were also analyzed to estimate whether the hypoxia periods could be related to anthropogenic eutrophication. The diatom analyses suggest relatively stable nutrient conditions for the past 200 years in Lake Lehmilampi. Climate, on the other hand, seems to be an important driver of hypoxia oscillations based on correlation analysis. The role of individual forcing factors and their interaction with hypolimnetic hypoxia would benefit from further investigations. Understanding climatic and anthropogenic forcing behind hypolimnetic hypoxia oscillations is essential when assessing the fate of boreal lakes in a multi-stressor world.

AB  - From the moment of emergence in scientific and practical literature of the concept "outsourcing" process of formation of the new direction characterized by development of new models, forms and types of sourcing and on its basis of programs of strategic development began. Each of the models of sourcing existing today has the advantages, shortcomings and a scope. Also today in scientific and practical literature various methods and techniques of an assessment of expediency and efficiency of application of this or that model of sourcing, its this or that look are presented. Despite a demand and popularity of outsourcing, illiterate use of this model of management in the Russian conditions of production and underdeveloped small and medium business in the country can seriously worsen a financial solvency of the enterprise. Therefore, the major factor in making decision on application of production outsourcing is competently carried out economic assessment taking into account features of production and nature of introduction of this tool at the enterprise. According to researches of the Accenture company, the majority of the organizations has even no elementary techniques and indicators for an assessment of economic efficiency of application of outsourcing. As a rule, the management of the enterprises more is necessary on "whims" of the market and opinion of more competitive partner outsourcers. The purpose of the real work is development of a technique of an assessment of economic effect of application of restructuring outsourcing at the large industrial enterprise.

AB  - This study aims at to make a heuristic analysis of energy efficiency performance of Indian paper industry in a non-parametric production theoretic approach. Using the data for 2004-05 to 2013-14, radial and non-radial variants of DEA were employed to estimate energy saving potential and identify the relative position of paper industry across the states. Preliminary analysis in terms of energy intensity scores showed declining trends of energy intensity over the period of analysis for most of the states except states like Assam, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Punjab where it does not decline much. Assuming a variable returns to scale (VRS) technology under the conditions of inherent heterogeneity and market imperfection, the slack-based measure (SBM) reported a much higher energy saving potential than reported by other measures in the study. Further by taking scale efficiency into account, the study documented the higher contribution of pure energy inefficiency in explaining the total energy inefficiency within the paper industry relative to scale inefficiency. Finally, the study recommends the propagation of energy efficiency program through a market-based and regulatory mechanism along with consolidation and technological advancement of individual units, in order to tap vast energy saving potential and thereby ensure the growth and environmental sustainability.

AB  - The aim of this work was to understand how two different soil types (calcareous - C and non-calcareous soils - NC) affect carob tree nutritional performance and bioactive compounds present in the pulp of the pod. Two orchards were selected in two separately separate locations: in soil C, trees were grown under calcareous conditions, with high percentage of active lime (>9%) and a soil pH of 8.1 and in soil NC, no carbonates were present and soil pH was 6.6. Leaf mineral composition, total leaf chlorophyll and several bioactive compounds were monitored in trees of the cv. 'Mulata' during three years and covering two seasons in both orchards. Unripe and ripe pods were separately analyzed. Trees in the NC site were smaller and less vigorous but presented higher leaf chlorophyll, and higher N, Mg, Zn, Fe and Mn in leaves, than trees of the C site. In the latter, only Ca and K were slightly higher. Unripe pods in both orchards showed significantly higher polyphenols content and high anti-oxidant activity (expressed as DPPH). Condensed tannins content was related to leaf mineral composition (N, Zn and Mn) but among these, Mn was the most important and its accumulation in leaves is a good indicator of anti-oxidant activity. Condensed tannins content was higher in unripe pods of trees in the NC site.

AB  - Thin layers of water running over rocky surfaces are characteristic of madicolous habitats, which harbor a peculiar Chironomidae community. However, information on the identity, distribution, and ecology of madicolous chironomids in the Neotropical region are still sparse. The main purpose of this research is to reveal and contribute to the ecology of madicolous Chironomidae species, especially regarding their altitudinal distribution in the Atlantic Forest. Sampling was performed using our own designed emergence traps deployed from 0 to 2700 m a.s.l. in 70 sites in three mountains in southeastern Brazil. Sixty taxa of chironomids were collected and identified, of which only 22 are known to science. Most of the species showed a wider distribution than previously known, both in terms of geographic and altitudinal ranges, while others showed significant association with particular altitudinal bands (as evidenced by the indicator species analysis). Atlantic Forest mountainous regions are known to harbor one of the richest fauna in the world and have been suffering from several types of environmental impacts, including climate change, which will especially affect taxa living in specialized habitats. The narrow range of tolerance to environmental conditions verified for mountain species, and the fact that many of them are rare and endemic, make the conservation efforts in these areas indispensable.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is induced by complex hereditary and environmental factors. However, the mechanisms of ASD development are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to identify standard indicators of this condition by comparing clinical, pathophysiological, and neurobehavioral features in an autism-like animal model. A total of 22 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control and 500 mg/kg propionic acid (PPA)-treated groups. Rats were subjected to behavioral tests, gene expression analyses, and histological analyses to detect pathophysiological and neurobehavioral alterations. Exploratory activity and non-aggressive behavior were significantly reduced in PPA-treated rats, whereas enhanced aggressive behavior during adjacent interactions was observed on day 14 after PPA administration. To evaluate gene expression after PPA administration, we analyzed hippocampal tissue using reverse transcription PCR. Glial fibrillary acidic protein was augmented in the PPA-treated group on day 14 after appearance of ASD-like behaviors by PPA administration, whereas octamer-binding transcription factor 4 expression was significantly decreased in the PPA-treated group. Histological evaluation revealed significantly reduced diameter and layer thickness of granule cells in PPA-treated rats compared with control rats. We conclude that PPA administration induced abnormal neural cell organization, which may have led to autism-like neurobehaviors, including increased aggressive behavior, reduced exploratory activity, and isolative and passive behaviors.

AB  - Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) aims to determine if the environmental effect of an activity or project complies with standards and regulations. A primary component of the environment to evaluate is air and the effect that various activities can have on its quality. To this end, emission factors (EFs), which are empirical coefficients or mathematical relationships, are normally used. The present research critically analyzes the implications and consequences of using imported EFs in environmental impact studies (EISs), taking as case of study the situation in Chile. Among the main results, the widespread use of EFs in EISs in the country and the lack of assessments of their actual applicability stand out. In addition, the official guidelines related to emissions estimation that are used for EIA in the country mostly include EFs derived elsewhere, without considering the recommendations or restrictions that the original sources indicate for their use. Finally, the broad use of default values defined for the Metropolitan Region in Central Chile, is highly questionable for a country that extends north-south along more than 35 of latitude, with wide variability in climate, traffic conditions, population, soil types, etc. Finally, it is very likely that situations similar to those observed in the present work occurs in other countries with young environmental impact assessment systems, and therefore, that the results herein presented should be of general interest and relevance.

AB  - The current outbreak of eastern larch beetle (Dendroctonus simplex LeConte) in Minnesota, USA, ongoing since 2000, has been characterized with a severity and duration unprecedented in previous outbreaks within the state. This study investigates the relationship between tamarack mortality due to eastern larch beetle and extant stand and site characteristics. Observations of tree attribute information and site condition collected over the course of the outbreak from nearly 15,000 tamarack trees in three different ecological regions of Minnesota were modeled using linear regression. Increasing tree diameter was the best indicator of tamarack mortality within the northern limits of the state's tamarack range and during the later portion of the outbreak. Tamarack density was negatively related to tree mortality in the north central region during the later outbreak, while the density of co-located non-host gymnosperms was positively related to tree mortality in areas of marginal host distribution. A temporal change in the importance of predictor variables suggests that the influence of tree and site characteristics evolved as the outbreak progressed and subsequent mortality increased. A greater understanding of the factors associated with tamarack mortality and how the those factors change over time and space will help to inform management practices and mitigate the impacts of this bark beetle on the tamarack resource in Minnesota.

AB  - A field study was conducted to investigate translocation and accumulation of four heavy metals: cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in 10 different plants : corn (Zea mays L.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), onion (Allium cepa L.), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris subsp.vulgaris L.), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var.capitata L.), plantain (Plantago major L.) in samples from 2 sites (unpolluted-Leposavio and polluted-Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo province). The results presented here showed that transfer factors-TF (heavy metals from soil to plants) are dependent on each other and comparison of the transfer factor for various species has significance only if all other conditions (especially environments) are equal. Heavy metals accumulate in plant species with different intensity. Our findings indicated that Cd and Zn accumulated the most with the transfer factor of 1.0-10, followed by Cu with TF of 0.1-1.0, while Pb had the lowest accumulation with TF usually 0.01-0.1. TF decreased when the plants were grown in the soil with higher level of heavy metals. When the growing takes place on the same type of soil, the heavy metals accumulation in different species decreases in the following order: grains < root vegetables < fruit vegetables<leaf vegetables. Only one species (P. major) was detected to be a bioaccumulator.

AB  - Soil respiration was usually used to be the sensitivity indicators of contamination due to their importance in cycling of organic matter in soils. In order to understand the effect of environmental factors on the bioremediation of crude oil contamination at arid and semi-arid regions, the dynamics of soil respiration and degradation rate of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were determined using a 59 days laboratory incubation experiment under a range of crude oil contaminated levels, soil water contents and C:N ratio in soils. Results showed that crude oil contaminated soil of lower C:N ratio (6:1) had significant greater soil respiration and TPH degradation than that with the higher C:N ratio (25:1). Although the TPH degradation rate decreased with the increase of contamination levels, the soil respiration and TPH degradation of contaminated soil is higher than the uncontaminated soils, especially when the contamination level was more than 20 g kg(-1). Unlike the factors of C:N ratio and contamination levels, the soil water content has no significant effect on soil respiration and TPH degradation. These results indicated that low nitrogen concentration rather than soil water content was the main limiting factors for soil respiration and TPH degradation in contamination soils at Northwest China when the soil water content reach 20%.

AB  - Here, we compared sensor precision and drift among four commonly used dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor types under laboratory conditions, and evaluated their accuracy of measurement of stream ecosystem metabolism (EM) and subsequent assessment of stream ecosystem health in the field. Of all tested sensor types, optical sensors had the highest precision, followed by miniaturized polarographic sensors. Traditional polarographic and pulsed polarographic sensors had a lower precision. The traditional polarographic sensors were the only ones exhibiting detectable sensor drift that had to be corrected for, prior to calculations of EM. In parallel EM measurements in two rural and two pristine tropical streams, the four compared DO sensor types estimated relatively similar gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R) and GPP:R ratios in each stream, and classified all streams as highly heterotrophic. Nonetheless, parallel GPP and R estimates with different sensors had relative standard deviations of the mean between 6.2% and 34.9%, and between 7.9% and 16.3%, respectively. Thus, sensor accuracy can be a major source of variability in EM estimates. There were only minor differences in stream ecosystem health assessments among different DO sensors, compared to differences between different assessment methods. While all tested sensor types yielded useful ecosystem health classifications, the optical sensor type was the most accurate, and thus, the most suitable for functional impact assessment and monitoring.

AB  - In this study, the environmental loads of 100 kWp cadmium telluride photovoltaic (CdTe PV) power generation systems in Malaysia are analyzed using life cycle assessment. The target renewable energy system is made up of CdTe PV panel, a power conditioning system and a balance of system. Life-cycle environmental issues were analyzed using major indicators like global warming potential, fossil fuel consumption, energy payback time, and CO2 payback time. Then, the results were compared with those of alternative PV systems such as single- and multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaics.
   The CdTe PV systems presently have a GWP of 15.1 g CO2 equivalent/kW h in Malaysia. The CdTe PV panel is the greatest contributor to global warming potential in the system, accounting for 47.8%. Electricity used in the semiconductor deposition process is the major contributor of GWP in CdTe PV panel. Total fossil fuel consumption is 0.221 MJ/kW h. The CdTe PV panel accounts for 49.3% of the total fossil fuel consumption. Energy payback time and CO2 payback time are 0.94 years and 0.76 years, respectively, and those are relatively short periods compared with other PV power plants. The energy return on investment of the CdTe PV system was found to be superior to other Si-based PV systems. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - If longevity is a biological and demographic indicator to determine human lifetime extension, hyper-longevity notion can represent a heuristic tool to better disentangle the complex bio-psycho-social implications of ageing and elderly in Western developed globalised countries. Departing from the assumption of a holistic approach to human condition understanding, it is possible to reveal the grounds and patterns of a multilayered and multidimensional structuring of longevity and ageing in our societies that would lead to a form of hyper-longevity. Socio-cultural processes, underlying hyper-longevity notion, rise the question of transition from modern/ late-modern societies to post-modern ones and it offers room for a cultural analysis of concepts, such as space time compression, digital capitalism, knowledge and mass information society. These are relevant ideas that can contribute to reshape and rethink the boundaries and traits of ageing experience in 21st century societies. To better catch the point emerging social category of Baby Boomers is presented and used to provide a concrete context related example on how hyper-longevity can better explain complex social evidences in many cultural respects and social domains. As a conclusive step some preliminary reflections, largely centered on the relation between Baby Boomers, hyper-longevity and bio-medical sciences are presented and discussed to provide a starting point for further future analyses within a trans and inter-disciplinary framework

AB  - A three-year experiment on early nectarine (Prunus persica L. Batsch cv. Flanoba) trees was carried out with the aim of studying the impact of environmental variables on the trunk diameter fluctuation parameters and the usefulness of the reference-lines derived from the relationship between different meteorological variables and plant water status indicators for sustainable irrigation scheduling. Plants were drip-irrigated and submitted to non-limiting soil water conditions. Measurements of stem water potential at midday (Psi(stem)), trunk daily growth rate (TGR) and maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) were related with meteorological variables. MDS presented the best fitting line-regressions with both the average air temperature and vapour pressure deficit during the period 11.00-15.00 h solar time, since the most important fraction of trunk shrinkage occurred during that period of time, reaching 74% of MDS (on average over the three years studied), and sometimes 90%. The cause of the poor correlation of MDS with ET0 is discussed. Despite the continuous trunk growth of the trees during the experimental period and slight difference in crop load, inter-annual differences were not observed for the three reference lines obtained in any given year (fruit growth, early and late postharvest period).

AB  - The Marib-Shabowah Basin is an important hydrocarbon province in western Yemen, but the origin of hydrocarbons is not fully understood. In this regard, geochemical characteristics are used to provide information on source organic matter input, depositional environment and the correlation between crude oils from different pay zones. Two oil families are present within the study area and classified based on biomarker and non-biomarker parameters. The family I oils are characterized by low API gravity, high sulfur and trace metal (Ni, V) contents and low Ph/Ph ratio <1.0. These oils were derived from an alga organic matter that was deposited in a highly anoxic, hypersaline marine depositional environment and generated at low maturity.
   Family II oils have medium to high API gravity, low sulfur and trace metal contents and relatively high Pr/Ph ratios (1.09-1.59). The family II oils were derived from mixed marine and terrigenous organic matter and deposited under sub-oxic conditions. These oils were generated from source rocks with a wide range of thermal maturity ranging from early to peak oil window. The oil characteristics suggest that family! oils may be derived from the Tithonian age Safer calcareous shales and family II oils from the deeper Kimmeridgian Madbi shales. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nanostructured titanium materials with high UV-visible activity were synthesized in the collaborative project Clean Water FP7. In this study, the efficiency of some of these catalysts to degrade endocrine disruptor compounds, using bisphenol A as the model compound, was evaluated. Titanium dioxide P25 (AEROXIDE (R) TiO2, Evonik Degussa) was used as the reference. The photocatalytic degradation was carried out under the UV part of a simulated solar light (280-400 nm) and under the full spectrum of a simulated solar light (200 nm-30 gm). Catalytic efficiency was assessed using several indicators such as the conversion yield, the mineralization yield, by-product formation and the endocrine disruption effect of by-products. The new synthesized catalysts exhibited a significant degradation of bisphenol A, with the so-called ECT-1023t being the most efficient. The intermediates formed during photocatalytic degradation experiments with ECT-1023t as catalyst were monitored and identified. The estrogenic effect of the intermediates was also evaluated in vivo using a ChgH-GFP transgenic medaka line. The results obtained show that the formation of intermediates is related to the nature of the catalyst and depends on the experimental conditions. Moreover, under simulated UV, in contrast with the results obtained using P25, the by-products formed with ECT-1023t as catalyst do not present an estrogenic effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction. Man devotes most of the daily time to work, and also a large part of physical and mental resources. Depression and many other morbid conditions can be related etiopathologically to the performance of a dangerous occupation in terms of quality (hazardous work activities, lack of motivation for deficient career opportunities) or merely quantitative (duration of work shifts, frequency shifts work). The medical legal ascertainment is limited because stress cannot be valued by objective nature, but only through precious elements collected directly by workers by questionnaires. This is in response to legal requirements in terms of civil liability, occupational disease and disability. Aim and methods. The objective of this study is to analyze the change of cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha) and stress-related hormones (prolactin and cortisol) in a sample of 314 individuals working at the University Hospital Umberto I in Rome without acute diseases but only with the "feeling stressed" for at least a month and to analyze if there is a correlation between some of these biochemical variables and stress values measured by questionnaire. Results. The results of this study confirm the usefulness to associate laboratory analysis, such as the study of inflammatory cytokines and the hormonal profile, to psychometric tests, precious for the lower cost and in some cases also for the high diagnostic sensitivity, to reach a probative value which satisfies even the most demanding application of accuracy.

AB  - A healthy body of freshwater can provide numerous benefits to the society, although currently, the degradation of such ecosystems has been increased due to the establishment of urban areas along its riverbanks. In this study we analyzed the spatial effect of these zones on the water quality, using the benthonic macroinvertebrate communities as bioindicators of fluvial contamination in the Gibbs channel of the Temuco commune (38 degrees 46'S 72 degrees 38'W). The samplings were performed in spring, in six sites. The macrozoobentos was composed by a total of 15 taxa, corresponding to organisms tolerant to anoxic conditions and hid concentrations of organic matter, such as amphipods (Hyalella), dipterans (Quironomidae), and oligochaetes (Oligochaeta). There was a marked difference in the composition and abundance of taxa between the pre-urban, urban, and post-urban areas (ANOSIM Global R = 0.882, p = 0.001) tendency that was also recorded by the physicochemical parameters (ANOSIM Global R = 0.498, p = 0.001), of which pH, total suspended solids, and dissolved oxygen are those that best explained the patterns observed in the macrozoobentos. The results obtained with the biotic family index (ChIBF) were similar to those registered in the lower parts of the basins of southern Chile and the invertebrate community was shown to be sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - In order to evaluate the origin and the transformation of organic matter on the shallow shelf of the NW Adriatic Sea, organic carbon, total nitrogen and stable isotope ratios of organic carbon were analysed in riverine suspended matter and sediments as well as in marine suspended and sedimentary organic matter, in marine phytoplankton and zooplankton.
   The deposition of organic matter is influenced by fine sediment concentration. Surface sediments were characterised by highly variable biogeochemical conditions on the sea floor, whereas sub-surface sediments showed a more homogeneous hypoxic/anoxic environment.
   Low C-org/N ratio and high organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in riverine suspended organic matter indicate an important contribution of freshwater phytoplankton within rivers, particularly during low flow regimes, which adds to the marine phyto- and zooplankton at shelf locations.
   In order to evaluate the importance of terrestrial, riverine and marine sources of OM in shelf sediments, a three end-member mixing model was applied to shelf surface sediments using C-13/C-12 values for organic matter and N/C ratios. The model showed an elevated contribution of terrestrial organic substances at intermediate depths (10-15 m), mostly corresponding to an area of coarser grain-size, whereas the riverine and marine organic fractions were mainly accumulating near the coast and offshore, respectively.

AB  - (222)Rn was used to assess river-groundwater interactions within Castel di Sangro alluvial aquifer (Italy). The effectiveness of results obtained through this indicator was verified by also analyzing delta(18)O, major ions and temperature in both surface and groundwater, and carrying out piezometric head monitoring and discharge measurements. Hydrogeological investigations suggested that the river infiltrates into the aquifer in the south-eastern aquifer portion, while groundwater discharges into the river in the north-eastern portion. The latter phenomenon is supported by (222)Rn data. Nevertheless, flow-through conditions cause the modelled discharge along this river reach, estimated by (222)Rn data in a degassing-corrected two-component mixing model, to be greater than the measured discharge. Concerning river infiltration into the aquifer, delta(18)O, major ions and temperature data show that the river contribution is negligible in terms of aquifer recharge. Thus, the observed increase in (222)Rn concentration in that portion of the aquifer is due to the enrichment process caused by infiltration of rainwater ((222)Rn free) which flows from the local divide area. Hence, in the study site, the use of only (222)Rn to predict river-groundwater interactions causes some estimation inaccuracies and it must be coupled with other hydrochemical and hydrogeological parameters to gain a thorough understanding of such interactions.

LA  - English
CP  - 6th International Conference on Geomorphology
KW  - MAXIMUM
AB  - La Malinche volcano is located in the eastern sector of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). At least, five glacial advances have been documented in the Pleistocene for higher volcanoes of the TMVB. La Malinche and Nevado de Toluca volcanoes were severely affected by periglacial processes during the last two glacial advances. These processes produced landforms such as rock glaciers and scree slopes on La Malinche. This study has two primary purposes: to develop geomorphologic mapping of the La Malinche summit area on a scale of 1:25,000 and include glacial and periglacial landforms, and to analyze the topographic conditions where rock glaciers developed by using multivariate analysis. The geomorphologic map was obtained through photo-interpretation and fieldwork where volcanic, glacial, periglacial, fluvio-glacial and mass wasting landforms were observed. To carry out the analysis of the topographic parameters, a digital elevation model (DEM) was used. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was useful in identifying specific factors that explain correlations between topographic variables. Results of PCA show that altitude is the main factor in controlling the location of periglacial landforms. Cluster Analysis (CA) was helpful in classifying fossil rock glaciers according to height similarities, and two groups were obtained where two possible generations of rock glaciers were established. Results from multivariate analysis, indicated that geomorphic processes and landform development at the summit area are highly sensitive to climatic oscillation. Periglacial landforms on the summit area served as indicators of environmental change.

AB  - We investigated the effects of fault-related folding mechanisms along a single fault that is pinned on both ends, upsection and downsection. Using a numerical model we produced flanking structures under plane strain transtension for the whole range between simple shear, general shear and pure shear, with layer-parallel shortening parallel and shear zone widening normal to the shear zone boundaries. Under these boundary conditions, contractional flanking folds with thrusting kinematics are the structures that are most likely to form and s-type flanking folds develop stable orientations. Comparison with natural examples reveals that contractional flanking structures occur from the outcrop scale within ductile shear zones, where they can be used as kinematic indicators in special cases, up to the mesoscopic scale within fold and thrust belts. The fundamental differences of our model to existing fault-related fold models like fault-propagation folds, fault-bend folds or break-thrust folds are: (1) the fault does not necessarily maintain a stable orientation but may rotate during progressive development; (2) the drag can change from reverse to normal along the fault; (3) the displacement along the fault has its maximum in the centre of the fault and decreases in both directions, downsection and upsection towards fixed fault tips.

AB  - Properties of a claim loam soil, collected in Aranjuez (Madrid) and enriched with organic matter and microorganisms, were evaluated under controlled temperature and moisture conditions, over a period of three months. The following treatments were carried out: soil (control); soil + 50 t ha(-1) of animal manure (E50); soil + 50 t ha(-1) of animal manure + 30 L ha-1 of effective microorganisms (E50EM); soil + 30 t ha(-1) of the combination of various green crop residues and weeds (RC30) and soil + 30 t ha(-1) of the combination of various green crop residues and weeds + 30 L ha(-1) of effective microorganisms (RC30EM). Soil samples were taken before and after incubation and their physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters analyzed. Significant increase was observed in the production of exopolysaccharides and basic phosphatase and esterase enzyme activities in the treatments E50EM and RC30EM, in correlation with the humification of organic matter, water retention at field capacity, and the cationic exchange capacity (CEC) of the same treatments. The conclusion was drawn that the incorporation of a mixture of effective microorganisms (EM) intensified the biological soil activity and improved physical and chemical soil properties, contributing to a quick humification of fresh organic. matter. These findings were illustrated by the microbiological activities of exopolysaccharides and by alkaline phosphatase and esterase enzymes, which can be used as early and integrated soil health indicators.

AB  - Innovative problem-solving ability is a predictor of whether animals can successfully cope with environmental changes. These environmental changes can test the limits of animals, for example when energy availability decreases seasonally and, hence, problem-solving performance decreases because less energy is available for cognitive processes. Here, we investigated: (1) how problem-solving performance changed between seasons that differed significantly in food availability; (2) whether these changes were related to environmentally induced physiological changes in blood glucose and ketone levels, indicators of energy availability; and (3) whether individual variation in problem-solving was related to sex differences. We studied 99 free-ranging African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa, 55 during the hot dry summer with low food availability and 44 during the cold wet winter with higher food availability. We measured their problem-solving abilities using a food extraction task and found no seasonal differences in problem-solving success. However, mice solved the problem faster in summer versus winter. In summer, food availability was reduced and blood ketones increased but there was no seasonal difference in blood glucose levels. There were no correlation between problem-solving performance and blood glucose or ketone levels. Overall, more males solved the task than females. It appears that in striped mice cognitive functions can be maintained under harsh environmental conditions.

AB  - Woody biomass could potentially become a viable raw material for the future sustainable chemical industry. For this, a suitable regulatory framework must exist, that would create favourable economic conditions for wood biorefineries. Such policies must be developed on the basis of scientific evidence-in this case, data supporting the environmental advantages of the bio-based feedstocks to the chemical industry. The most suitable methodology for comprehensive evaluation of environmental performance of technologies is life cycle assessment (LCA). In this review, the available LCA studies of woody biomass fractionation and conversion to bulk chemical feedstocks are critically evaluated. It has been revealed that the majority of the openly available studies do not contain transparent inventory data and, therefore, cannot be verified or re-used; studies containing inventory data are reported in this review. The lack of inventory data also prevents comparison between studies of the same processes performed with different evaluation methods or using different system boundaries. Recommendations are proposed on how to overcome issues of commercial data sensitivity by using black-box modelling when reporting environmental information. From several comparable LCA studies, it has been concluded that today the most environmentally favourable technology for wood biomass fractionation is organosolv. This article is part of the theme issue 'Bio-derived and bioinspired sustainable advanced materials for emerging technologies (part 1)'.

AB  - Methotrexate is an antineoplastic folate analog of high environmental concern, due to its low biodegradability and toxicological properties. This study focused on its photodegradation under two irradiation conditions, aiming to be representative of environment (300-450 nm) and drinking water treatment (254 nm). The photodegradation experiments were conducted at two pH, to vary the methotrexate ionization state and to produce a large variety of transformation products (TPs). The degradation kinetics determined through LC-UV monitoring were contrasted according to pH and irradiation wavelength. However, the quantum yields were independent of ionization state at 254 nm and the changes in kinetics at higher wavelengths were attributed to a change in the degradation mechanism. The TPs formed during the reactions were identified by UHPLC-MS/MS, using both the positive and negative modes. Among the eleven proposed structures, five were described as methotrexate TPs for the first time. The TPs result from N-demethylation, glutamic acid oxidation, and C-N cleavage, all of them leading to further degraded photoproducts presenting modified or lost glutamic acid part. This was made possible thanks to the negative mode, which allowed the exploration of the glutamic acid moiety modifications. Cytotoxicity assessment on A549 cancer cells demonstrated that all photoproducts formed at pH 7 were less toxic than the parent compound.

AB  - Management of nitrogen (N) fertilizers is an important agricultural practice and field of research to minimize environmental impacts and the cost of production. To apply N fertilizer at the right rate, time, and place depends on the crop type, desired yield, and field conditions. The objective of this study is to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery, vegetation indices (VI), crop height, field topographic metrics, and soil properties to predict canopy nitrogen weight (g/m(2)) of a corn field in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Random Forests (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models were evaluated for canopy nitrogen weight prediction from 29 variables. RF consistently had better performance than SVR, and the top-performing validation model was RF using 15 selected height, spectral, and topographic variables with an R-2 of 0.73 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.21 g/m(2). Of the model's 15 variables, crop height was the most important predictor, followed by 10 VIs, three MicaSense band reflectance mosaics (blue, red, and green), and topographic profile curvature. The model information can be used to improve field nitrogen prediction, leading to more effective and efficient N fertilizer management.

AB  - In this investigation, a green, cost-effective clean electrochemical process for preparing a highly concentrated ferric chloride (FeCl3) solution has been proposed. Many operating conditions, affected the used anodic dissolution process for FeCl3 production, were studied. Generating ferrous hydroxide electrochemically then dissolving it by hydrochloric acid and oxidized with chlorine free mixed oxidant, were proceeded steps to reach the production of our target ferric chloride. It is a green, clean, and novel process because it is environmentally and industrial safer than the traditional production technology. The most important studied experimental variables were applied like applied current density, sodium chloride concentration, electrolyte pH, at the most controlling operating parameter which is optimum electrolysis time. Experimental results revealed that optimum current density was 300 mA/cm(2); using 30gm/L saline solution, electrodes gap distance 5 cm, and stirring rate 150 rpm at pH 6.5 for 270 minutes, respectively. At these optimal operating parameters, 40% FeCl3 concentration can be prepared to consume 202 watts/liter of high quality with low capital, & operating costs. The economic indicators show that the running cost of production of 40% ferric chloride solution using the proposed cleaner electrochemical production technology will be 241.66$/ton and the suggested price is 450$/ton with a net profit of 156$ with high cash flow using the proposed green technology. The proposed methodology for FeCl3 production reviews the importance of using cleaner production and sustainable development indicators.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the environmental hazards posed by solid particles resulting from road transport. To achieve this, a methodology used to inventory pollutant emissions was used in accordance with the recommendations of the EMEP/EEA (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme/European Economic Area). This paper classifies particulates derived from road transport with reference to their properties and sources of origin. The legal status of environmental protection against particulate matter is presented. The emissions of particulate matter with different properties from different road transport sources is examined based on the results of Poland's inventory of pollutant emissions in the year 2018. This study was performed using areas with characteristic traffic conditions: inside and outside cities, as well as on highways and expressways. The effects of vehicles were classified according to Euro emissions standards into the categories relating to the emissions of different particulate matter types. The results obtained showed that technological progress in the automobile sector has largely contributed to a reduction in particulate matter emissions associated with engine exhaust gases, and that this has had slight effect on particulate matter emissions associated with the tribological processes of vehicles. The conclusion formed is that it is advisable to undertake work towards the control and reduction of road transport particulate matter emissions associated with the sources other than engine exhaust gases.

AB  - The use of a single host strain that allows for an evaluation of the levels of total coliphages in any type of environmental sample would facilitate the detection of and reduction in complexity and costs, favoring countries or areas with technical and economic limitations. The CB390 strain is a candidate for this type of simultaneous determinations, mainly in water samples. The objective of the study was to establish the recovery capacity of the CB390 strain in solid and semi-solid samples and to evaluate the microbiological quality of the sludge generated and stabilized by lime and drying beds in two WWTPs in Colombia. The results of both matrices indicated that CB390 recovered similar numbers of total coliphages (p > 0.05) against the two host strains when evaluated separately. Only the drying bed treatment was able to reduce between 2.0 and 2.9 Log(10) units for some microorganisms, while the addition of lime achieved a maximum reduction of 1.3 Log(10) units for E. coli. In conclusion, the CB390 strain can be used in solid and semi-solid samples, and the treatment in a drying bed provided a product of microbiological quality. However, the results are influenced by the infrastructure of the WWTP, the treatment conditions, and the monitoring of the stabilization processes.

AB  - The Qaidam Basin in the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau preserves a continuous and thick Cenozoic sedimentary succession, which is of great significance to studying the aridification of inland Asia. Based on the normalized concentrations (element/Al) and chloride content records of the lacustrine sediments in deep drilling well SS9 in the western Qaidam Basin, the change in the aridity of inland Asia during the late Middle Eocene was investigated. The results show that the Al-normalized concentrations of Na and Cl, which are indicator elements of saline lake sediments, increased sharply at similar to 38 Ma. The peaks in the Ga/Al and chloride values indicate that the salinity of the lake was extremely high at similar to 38 Ma. Based on these results, the sudden decrease in the sedimentation rate, the chemical weathering index, the hematite content, and the (smectite + illite/smectite)/illite ratios, the Qaidam Basin experienced abrupt aridification during this period. The decrease in water vapor transport caused by the final retreat of the Paratethys Sea from the southern Tarim Basin may have been the main reason for the changes in the arid environment in the Qaidam Basin during the late Middle Eocene. Long-term global cooling and the uplift of the Altyn Tagh may have played a role in the background conditions.

AB  - The diagnosis of land degradation requires a deep understanding of ecosystem functioning and evolution. In dryland systems, in particular, research efforts must address the redistribution of scarce resources for vegetation, in a context of high spatial heterogeneity and non-linear response. This fact explains the prevalence of ecohydrological perspectives interested in runoff processes and, the more recent, focused on connectivity as an indicator of system resource optimisation. From a geomorphological perspective and reviewing the concepts of eco-hydro-geomorphological interactions operating in ecosystems, this paper explores the effects of erosion on vegetation configuration through two case studies at different spatio-temporal scales. We focus on the structure function linkage, specifically on how morphological traits relate with different stages in the erosional sequence, both in the abiotic and the biotic domain. Results suggest that vegetation dynamics are affected by structural boundary conditions at both scales, i.e. by surface armouring related with rock fragments at the patch scale, and by the degree of hillslope-channel coupling at the hillslope scale. Our preliminary results can serve as new working hypotheses about the structure-function interplay on hillslopes. All this, taking advantage of the recent technological achievements for acquiring very high-resolution geospatial data that offer new analytical possibilities in a range of scales.

AB  - Much of human thought, feeling, and behavior unfolds automatically. Indirect measures of cognition capture such processes by observing responding under corresponding conditions (e.g., lack of intention or control). The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is one such measure. The IAT indexes the strength of association between categories such as "planes" and "trains" and attributes such as "fast" and "slow" by comparing response latencies across two sorting tasks (planes-fast/trains-slow vs. trains-fast/planes-slow). Relying on a reanalysis of multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) studies, Schimmack (this issue) argues that the IAT and direct measures of cognition, for example, Likert scales, can serve as indicators of the same latent construct, thereby purportedly undermining the validity of the IAT as a measure of individual differences in automatic cognition. Here we note the compatibility of Schimmack's empirical findings with a range of existing theoretical perspectives and the importance of considering evidence beyond MTMM approaches to establishing construct validity. Depending on the nature of the study, different standards of validity may apply to each use of the IAT; however, the evidence presented by Schimmack is easily reconcilable with the potential of the IAT to serve as a valid measure of automatic processes in human cognition, including in individual-difference contexts.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the most promising rootstock for the development of 'Uba' mango seedlings. We used three polyembryonic Mangifera indica L. rootstock cultivars 'Uba' and 'Imbul and one 'Uba' scion cultivar, 'Uba Clone 2' ('UC2'). The chlorophyll a fluorescence, gas exchange, proline content and growth of the rootstocks and their respective scion/rootstock combinations (UC2/Oleo, UC2/Uba and UC2/Imbu) were analyzed. The parameters selected for the PSII photochemical system by chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics (F-2, F-3, dV/dt(0), DI0/RC, DFABS and DFTOTAL) were suggested as physiological indicators and the leaf proline content was suggested as a biochemical indicator for identifying the higher PSII quantum efficiency, increased water use efficiency and greater vegetative growth in UC2/Oleo. With these results, it was possible to better understand the potential effects of 'Oleo', 'Uba' and 'Imbu' rootstocks on 'Uba' mango scion performance, distinguish the grafted plants on the 'Oleo' rootstock and confirm the superiority of this rootstock in the production of 'Uba' mango seedlings under optimal environmental conditions. Thus, measuring chlorophyll a fluorescence, a fast and nondestructive method, can be highly useful for identifying the most promising rootstock for the production of 'Uba' mango seedlings, replacing time-consuming methods in crop management.

AB  - This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model integrated with operational flexibility to optimize a hybrid combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system. The operational flexibility of the hybrid CCHP system is proposed and expressed by the combined indicators to show the capacity to resist performance degradation because of externally variable conditions to increase energy saving and cost saving, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and to enhance renewability, the ability to adjust heat and electricity, and the grid integration level. A Pareto frontier of solutions considering a larger operational flexibility with less performance degradation is obtained in genetic algorithm. The use of a multi-criteria decision making method combined with an entropy weighting method is employed to quantitatively evaluate the composite sustainability index of the Pareto schemes and choose the optimal hybrid CCHP option with the best integrated performance. The results of a case study that considers operational flexibility and optimization indicated that the potential adjustable ability was increased by 438.9%, and the grid integration level and net interaction with the grid were decreased by 3.6%. However, the increase in flexibility reduces the energetic, economic and environmental benefits achieved by the CCHP system by 5.1%, 56.4% and 3.0%, respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Spatial and temporal distribution of two species of adult's ostracods (Cyprideis sp. and Cyprideis salebrosa) were studied as a function of the rainfall patterns in the Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Samples were taken in ten stations, along six surveys representing three periods (Dry, Early and Late Rainy) for two years. Stations were nested in four areas (Outer, Central, EPA Guapimirim and Impacted). The bottom water (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation) were measured in each area to characterize the influence of seasonal variations by rainfall. Cyprideis sp. and Cyprideis salebrosa showed patterns distribution to seasonality/surveys (p = 0,002 and p<0,001, respectly). The spatial distribution of Cyprideis sp was significantly different areas studied (p<0.001) indicated well defined areas and distribution in along of the surveys. However, C. salebrosa showed homogeneous distribution in along of the areas within of each survey (p<0.001). Redundancy Analysis (RDA) for the two years evidenced environment preference of the Cyprideis sp. for areas with marine conditions (high influence for channel central) and C. salebrosa for brackish water (high influence of the rivers). This observation reinforces of the existence of areas created by the seasonality of pluviometric regime, a possible dispersion of the adult's ostracods and possibility the use with bioindicators.

AB  - Two primary use patterns exist for dsRNA-based products for crop protection: in planta produced dsRNA such as in a genetically engineered (GE) crop; and topically applied dsRNA such as a spray application. To enable effective environmental risk assessments for these products, dsRNA must be successfully measured in relevant environmental compartments (soil, sediment, surface water) to provide information on potential exposure. This perspective reviews results from numerous environmental fate and degradation studies with topically applied unformulated dsRNAs to demonstrate the high lability of these molecules and low potential for persistence in the environment. Additionally, we report on results of a pilot study of topically applied dsRNA on soybean plants demonstrating similar rapid degradation under field conditions. Microbial degradation of nucleic acids in environmental compartments has been shown to be a key driver for this lack of persistence. In fact, the instability of dsRNA in the environment has posed a challenge for the development of commercial topically-applied products. Formulations or other approaches that mitigate environmental degradation may lead to development of commercially successful products but may change the known degradation kinetics of dsRNAs. The formulation of these products and the resultant impacts on the stability of the dsRNA in environmental compartments will need to be addressed using problem formulation and product formulation testing may be required on a case by case basis to ensure an effective risk assessment.

AB  - Despite the growing interest in brain-machine interface (BMI)-driven neuroprostheses, the translation of the BMI output into a suitable control signal for the robotic device is often neglected. In this article, we propose a novel control approach based on dynamical systems that was explicitly designed to take into account the nature of the BMI output that actively supports the user in delivering real-valued commands to the device and, at the same time, reduces the false positive rate. We hypothesize that such a control framework would allow users to continuously drive a mobile robot and it would enhance the navigation performance. 13 healthy users evaluated the system during three experimental sessions. Users exploit a 2-class motor imagery BMI to drive the robot to five targets in two experimental conditions: with a discrete control strategy, traditionally exploited in the BMI field, and with the novel continuous control framework developed herein. Experimental results show that the new approach: 1) allows users to continuously drive the mobile robot via BMI; 2) leads to significant improvements in the navigation performance; and 3) promotes a better coupling between user and robot. These results highlight the importance of designing a suitable control framework to improve the performance and the reliability of BMI-driven neurorobotic devices.

AB  - This study was a follow-up of a previous study that investigated a set of selected fatty acids (FM; 12 of 56 pools) in Helix pomatia L. as biomarkers of chemical stress induced by applying micro-doses of molluscicides. Here, the potential of rarely used peroxidation (PI) and unsaturation (UI) coefficients were tested as biomarkers. These indices were calculated based on the FA profiles of foot and hepatopancreas tissues of H. pomatia L Snails were treated with three molluscicides: metaldehyde, methiocarb, and potassium chloride, in three doses each (5, 10, or 15 mu l, 0.01% w/v concentration), for 12 weeks, under laboratory conditions. Correlations were evaluated between frequently used oxidation status indicators (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, selenium-dependent peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione, carbonyl protein, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, in the form of MDA) and UI and PI ratios.
   These results confirmed that fatty acids could be directly used as biomarkers of exposure and oxidative physiological status in snails. Moreover, the UI and PI, calculated based on FAs, clearly reflected the current oxidation status in snails. These indices changed with the application of micro-doses of molluscicides. In conclusion, these indices could serve as sensitive biomarkers of chemical stress in snails. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Lower Cretaceous Wealden sideritic ironstones have a wide occurrence and great potential to aid the reconstruction of the depositional environments of the Weald Basin in SE England. However, mineralogical and geochemical datasets on the ironstones are scarce in the literature. Geochemical and mineralogical data on the sideritic ironstones are presented from the Wadhurst Clay Formation within the Weald Basin. The mineralogy of the ironstones was examined using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer and PANalytical's HighScore Plus software. Elemental composition of the ironstones was measured using a PANalytical MiniPal2 ED-XRF (benchtop X-ray spectrometer). The examination of the mineralogy of the Wealden ironstones confirms the presence of early diagenetic siderites. The trace-element assemblage shows that the sideritic ironstones are chemically pure pointing to a freshwater origin. The sideritic ironstones reveal anoxic conditions and palaeo-salinity in the basin. More generally, it is suggested that the composition of the host rocks has significant controls on the composition of sideritic ironstones in sedimentary basins. This work reinforces the importance of the composition of sideritic ironstones as useful non-traditional data for understanding the depositional settings of sedimentary basins, especially when traditional datasets are not readily available or insufficient.

AB  - Herbicides of the imidazolinone group have been used in irrigated rice and presented a long persistence in the soil, especially in floodplain areas with a low drainage, and could cause environmental contamination This study aims to evaluate the leaching and residual of herbicides belonging to the imidazolinone group in sprinkler and flood irrigation systems. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, with the application of the herbicides imazethapyr, imazethapyr + imazapic, and imazapyr + imazapic in soil irrigated by flooding and sprinkling. Subsequently, the soil was collected from the layers of 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, and 20-25 cm and packed in 500 mL capacity plastic pots in order to sow tomato as a bioindicator plant of the presence of the herbicides belonging to the imidazolinones. Phytotoxicity, length, and shoot thy matter mass of tomato plants were evaluated at 10 and 20 days after emergence. The herbicides of the imidazolinone chemical group presented a high potential for leaching and persistence with effects for more than 180 days after application. Based on the symptoms presented by the sensitive crop. the degradation of imazethapyr, imazethapyr + imazapic, and imazapyr + imazapic in the 0-15 cm layers was higher in soil with sprinkler irrigation when compared to flood irrigation. Thus, non-flooded soils present a greater capacity to degrade the herbicides belonging to the imidazolinone chemical group.

AB  - During the last 20 years, Argentina experienced several extreme and widespread droughts in many different regions, including the core cropland areas. The most devastating recent events were recorded in the years 2006, 2009 and 2011. Reported impacts of the main events induced losses of more than 4 billion U.S. dollars and more than 1 million persons were reported to be directly or indirectly affected. In this paper, we analyse the drought risk in Argentina, taking into account recent information on drought hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Accordingly, we identified the most severe droughts in Argentina during the 2000-2015 period using a combination of drought hazard indicators and exposure layers. Three main events were identified: (1) during spring 2006 droughts peaked in the northeast of Argentina, (2) in 2009 precipitation deficits indicated a drought epicenter in the central Argentinian plains, and (3) in 2011 the northern Patagonia region experienced a combination of natural disasters due to severe drought conditions and a devastating volcanic eruption. Furthermore, we analysed the dynamics of drought exposure for the population and the main economic sectors affected by municipality, i.e., agriculture and livestock production. Assets exposed to droughts have been identified with several records of drought impacts and declarations of farming emergencies. We show that by combining exposure and vulnerability with drought intensity it is feasible to detect the likelihood of regional impacts in different sectors.

AB  - Woodland expansion is a key component of Scottish land use policy, with targets to increase woodland cover from 18% towards 25% of land area by 2050. However, to date there has been little assessment of whether forestry policy is achieving its objectives. Here, we present an evaluation of woodland grant schemes based on site suitability modelling for the Lochaber Forest District in northwest Scotland. We perform a spatial analysis of woodland creation between 1988 and 2014 using site suitability scores generated through the Forest Research Ecological Site Classification (ESC) methodology. We further conduct in-depth interviews with fourteen stakeholders within the grant-scheme application process to explore the influence of ecological suitability on woodland planning. We find that 92% of woodlands are suited to current climate conditions, and that suitability has improved under the latest grant scheme. This is concurrent with an increased emphasis on suitability modelling in decision-making, though could be explained by cultural changes or a more rigorous approvals process. We find that ecological variables are used to inform woodland location and species selection, but that woodland type is more commonly determined by grant structure. Finally, we discuss other potential limits to grant scheme success, including climate change, edaphic variables and woodland management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are at increasing risk of thermal stress and recent work has shown that water temperature around seagrass meadows could be used as an indicator for seagrass condition. Satellite thermal data have not been linked to the thermal properties of seagrass meadows. This work assessed the covariation between 20 in situ average daily temperature logger measurement sites in tropical seagrass meadows and satellite derived daytime SST (sea surface temperature) from the daytime MODIS and Landsat sensors along the Great Barrier Reef coast in Australia. Statistically significant (R-2=0.787-0.939) positive covariations were found between in situ seagrass logger temperatures and MODIS SST temperature and Landsat sensor temperatures at all sites along the reef. The MODIS SST were consistently higher than in situ temperature at the majority of the sites, possibly due to the sensor's larger pixel size and location offset from field sites. Landsat thermal data were lower than field-measured SST, due to differences in measurement scales and times. When refined significantly and tested over larger areas, this approach could be used to monitor seagrass health over large (10(6)km(2)) areas in a similar manner to using satellite SST for predicting thermal stress for corals.

AB  - Surfactant Modified Zeolite (SMZ) represents a versatile, cost-effective permeable reactive material, capable of treating multiple classes of contaminants. The potential for HDTMA-Br, a cationic surfactant commonly used to modify zeolite, to desorb from the zeolite surface has been identified as a potential issue for the ongoing use of SMZ in water remediation contexts. This paper investigates the toxicity of HDTMA-Br towards enteric virus surrogates, F-RNA bacteriophage MS2 and E. coil, Bacillus subtilis, and soil microflora. The concentration of surfactant desorbing from SMZ was quantified through a bioassay using E. coil.
   Results showed HDTMA-Br concentrations of >= 10(-5) M were toxic to MS2, >= 10(-4) M were toxic to E. coli and >= 10(-6) M were toxic to B. subtilis. No toxic relationship was established between HDTMA-Br and soil microflora. Desorption of >= 10(-4) M of HDTMA-Br was shown for the two SMZ samples under the mixing conditions used. Effects of this surfactant on total soil microflora were ambiguous since no toxic relationship could be established, however, HDTMA-Br, at concentrations desorbing from SMZ, were shown to impact the soil bacterium B. subtilis. Further research is required to determine the effect of this surfactant on microbial populations and species diversity in soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important, yet poorly understood epigenetic DNA modification, especially in invertebrates. Aberrant genome-wide 5hmC levels have been associated with cadmium (Cd) exposure in humans, but such information is lacking for invertebrate bioindicators. Here, we aimed to determine whether this epigenetic mark is present in DNA of the hepatopancreas of the land snail Cantareus aspersus and is responsive to Cd exposure. Adult snails were reared under laboratory conditions and exposed to graded amounts of dietary cadmium for 14 days. Weight gain was used as a sublethal endpoint, whereas survival as a lethal endpoint. Our results are the first to provide evidence for the presence of 5hmC in DNA of terrestrial mollusks; 5hmC levels are generally low with the measured values falling below 0.03%. This is also the first study to investigate the interplay of Cd with DNA hydroxymethylation levels in a non-human animal study system. Cadmium retention in the hepatopancreas of C. aspersus increased from a dietary Cd dose of 1 milligram per kilogram dry weight (mg/kg d. wt). For the same treatment, we identified the only significant elevation in percentage of samples with detectable 5hmC levels despite the lack of significant mortalities and changes in weight gain among treatment groups. These findings indicate that 5hmC is an epigenetic mark that may be responsive to Cd exposure, thereby opening a new aspect to invertebrate environmental epigenetics.

AB  - Animal welfare is of increasing importance and minimizing the stress is one of its prerequisites. Transport and new uncontrollable or unpredictable social environment are stressful for dogs and can affect their welfare. Particular unpleasant situations for free-roaming dogs include their capture in public areas and caging during the transport, vehicle vibrations, traffic noise, unknown environment, unloading and restricted housing condition. The new environment for free-roaming dogs presents potentially stressful novel experiences, such as new surroundings, unfamiliar sights, sounds, smells and unfamiliar people and other dogs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of transport and housing in the new environment on blood parameters (cortisol, glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and leukocyte count and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) of 40 free-roaming dogs. Glucose concentration, leukocyte and neutrophil counts, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher (P < 0.001; P < 0.01) after transport in comparison with the level of the same parameters detected in dogs after housing in the new environment. Cortisol, cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and lymphocyte count were also increased immediately after the transport compared to the levels 24 h after when the dogs were housed in the new environment; yet, these differences were not statistically significant. Accordingly, study results indicate that the transport itself was more stressful for free-roaming dogs than their housing in the new environment.

AB  - The high concentration of population and industry in coastal areas leads to contamination. In situ biomonitors provide a reliable and cost-effective means of assessing the effects of contamination. Rigorous assessment of biomonitors is required to establish links between biomarker measurements and contamination in the environment. The aims of the present study were to assess the effects of metal contamination on the intertidal gastropod Bembicium nanum and to validate biomarkers for use in this species. B. nanum was sampled from a metal contamination gradient emanating from Port Kembla (NSW, Australia). Tissue metal concentrations were related to the condition of organisms as assessed using the biomarkers total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation and lysosomal destabilisation. Total tissue metal concentrations were highest in Port Kembla organisms, with copper contributing 56% of metals measured in organisms from this site. B. nanum from Port Kembla also had significantly higher lysosomal destabilisation, being 36% higher than Kiama and 80% higher than Shellharbour over the combined sampling times. Lysosomal destabilisation was related to total tissue metal concentration and Cu tissue concentration. The results of the present study establish B. nanum as a bioindicator of metal contamination, with effects primarily relating to copper, and support previous work on the species as an effective biomonitor of bioavailable metal.

AB  - Tissue metal concentrations are widely used as indicators of environmental contamination. High endogenous concentrations of essential metals such as copper (Cu) can mask changes in tissue metal concentrations. Experiments using enriched isotopes can provide greater insight into endogenous Cu exchange and more broadly the exposure-bioaccumulation-response relationship. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Cu exposure through the dietary uptake route in the intertidal gastropod Bembicium nanum. The marine alga Tetraselmis chuii was cultured at different Cu concentrations and fed to B. nanum. The Cu concentrations in T. chuii and B. nanum were analysed. Effects were measured using the biomarkers - total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation and lysosomal membrane destabilisation in B. nanum. Dietary uptake of Cu in B. nanum was investigated with a feeding experiment using a Cu-65 isotopically enriched solution. Although there were no significant differences in the Cu concentrations in B. nanum, lysosomal membrane destabilisation increased with the dietary Cu concentration. The Cu-65 experiment demonstrated that B. nanum accumulated Cu under the experimental conditions. The study showed that tissue Cu concentrations are not always indicative of effects in organisms and that enriched isotope analysis assists in understanding the exposure-bioaccumulation-response relationship.

AB  - High amounts of driftwood sail across the oceans and provide habitat for organisms tolerating the rough and saline environment. Fungi have adapted to the extremely cold and saline conditions which driftwood faces in the high north. For the first time, we applied high-throughput sequencing to fungi residing in driftwood to reveal their taxonomic richness, community composition, and ecology in the North Atlantic. Using pyrosequencing of ITS2 amplicons obtained from 49 marine logs, we found 807 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on clustering at 97 % sequence similarity cut-off level. The phylum Ascomycota comprised 74 % of the OTUs and 20 % belonged to Basidiomycota. The richness of basidiomycetes decreased with prolonged submersion in the sea, supporting the general view of ascomycetes being more extremotolerant. However, more than one fourth of the fungal OTUs remained unassigned to any fungal class, emphasising the need for better DNA reference data from the marine habitat. Different fungal communities were detected in coniferous and deciduous logs. Our results highlight that driftwood hosts a considerably higher fungal diversity than currently known. The driftwood fungal community is not a terrestrial relic but a speciose assemblage of fungi adapted to the stressful marine environment and different kinds of wooden substrates found in it.

AB  - Equitable provision of physical infrastructure must be seen as a prerequisite for achieving the sustainability of human settlements. Infrastructure provision needs to consider both the product (physical services) and the context in which the services will be provided and maintained in order to be sustainable. This article presents a holistic methodology for evaluating sustainability and poverty reduction impact of infrastructure projects in developing countries through societal, economics, institutional and environmental dimensions. ASPIRE toolkit uses qualitative evidence which feeds into 96 indicators producing visual outputs which can encourage users to consider contextual issues and develop valuable trade-offs between the four dimensions.
   The methodology and toolkit are applied to the evaluation of an infrastructure upgrading project in Korail, Bangladesh. The Urban Partnership for Poverty Reduction Project (UPPRP) in Korail supports a twin-pronged approach of provision of infrastructure (water, sanitation, roads and drainage) improvement through the Slum Improvement Fund and improvement of socio-economic conditions through the Socio-Economic Funds. The ASPIRE assessment allowed the authors to interrogate strengths and weaknesses of the UPPR project thereby demonstrating the value added by ASPIRE. Overall, the project was deemed successful in Korail. Socially, it allowed access to all types of services to the slum's residents with strong community engagement Land security however was noted to be a challenge, which needs to be addressed by institutions in Dhaka.

AB  - This work was devoted to investigating the long-term cumulative effect of municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents on the sediments, near the plant outlet, in Yunliang River in Nanjing, China. Laboratory experiments were performed to assess the effect of different aeration modes on the migration and distribution of phosphorus (P) in the sediments. The field investigation showed that the concentrations of organic matter, different P fractions, dehydrogenase activity and alkaline phosphatase activity in sediments near the STP outlet were higher than those in the upstream site. The results of laboratory studies documented that the retention of P in sediments mainly depended on the characteristics of sediments. Collectively, long-term intermittent aeration accelerated the conversion of parts of organic phosphorus to occluded Fe-P due to that Fe2+ were oxidized to Fe3+ gradually, inactivating the sediments P, which preventing P release completely even in the case of anoxic conditions. Compared with aerating to water, aerating to sediments was more effective on transferring total phosphorus and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in overlying water to sediments. Additionally, microbial enzymes activity was directly related to the concentrations of DIP, indicating that enzymes activity could serve as sensitive indicators of nutrient dynamics in water ecosystems.

AB  - Shearwaters are ideal for monitoring ocean conditions in the California Current because these predators are abundant, conspicuous, and responsive to oceanographic variability. Herein we evaluated black-vented (Puffinus opisthomelas), Buller's (P. bulleri), flesh-footed (P. carneipes), pink-footed (P. creatopus), short-tailed (P. tenuirostris), and sooty (P. griseus) shearwaters as fishery-independent indicators of predatory or prey fish availability. We analyzed four years (1996, 2001, 2005, 2008) of monthly (AugustNovember) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration seabird surveys, and United States Geological Survey Pacific Coast Fisheries Database catch, from the California coast to 200 nm offshore. An ordination of shearwater abundance and fish catch revealed that the shearwaters and 11 fish/squid species were significantly correlated with one or more of three principal components, which explained 86% of the variation and revealed distinct species assemblages. We evaluated multiple linear regression models for 19 fisheries using five shearwater metrics: density, aggregation, and behavior (traveling, stationary, feeding), three oceanographic indices, and latitude. Eight of these models had a shearwater metric as the primary predictor. In particular, feeding black-vented shearwater abundance explained 75% of dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) longline catch. This research illustrates the utility of shearwaters as ecosystem indicators, with direct application for predicting fishery catch of commercial importance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growing safe food crops in urban settings requires soil condition assessment because many sites may be metal contaminated. Of particular concern are trace metals found at urban sites as a result of litter, construction materials, industrial development, and traffic patterns. Although all soils contain trace metals inherited from the parent material, anthropogenic influences can influence and increase metals' plant availability. Different urban activities located on soils derived from three parent materials, marine, glacial marine, and glacial till, were selected in Metro Vancouver to assess tracemetal concentrations in the urban soils. Estimates of total (aqua regia) and available (dilute HCl) trace metals (Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb) were compared among the sites and between the surface soil and the underlying parent material to assess potential environmental risks associated with location of the urban sites. Comparisons were made to metal concentration standards in published government guidelines. Although urban activities do affect metal amounts, parent materials must be considered when assessing anthropogenic effects of trace metals in soils because metal contents vary among different parent materials. Results indicate that surface soil metal concentrations are influenced by geographical location within the urban setting and soil management practices. For a rapid and reproducible determination of potential trace metal concentrations, the use of 0.1 M HCl provides a useful initial assessment.

AB  - An electrochemical sensor was developed for attomolar Hg2+ detection. Three single-stranded DNA probes were rationally designed for selective and sensitive detection of the target, which combined T-Hg2+-T coordination chemistry and the characteristic of convenient modification of electrochemical signal indicator. Graphene and nanoAu were successively electrodeposited on a glass carbon electrode surface to improve the electrode conductivity and functionalize with the 10-mer thymine-rich DNA probe (P1). NanoAu carriers functionalized with 29-mer guanine-rich DNA probe (P3) labeled methyl blue (MB-nanoAu-P 3s) were used to further strengthen signal response. In the presence of Hg2+, a T-T mismatched dsDNA would occur between P1 and a 22-mer thymine-rich DNA probe (P2) on the electrode surface due to T-Hg2+-T coordination chemistry. Followed by adding the MB-nanoAu-P 3s for hybridization with P2, square wave voltammetry was executed. Under optimal conditions, Hg2+ could be detected in the range from 1.0 aM to 100 nM with a detection limit of 0.001 aM. Selectivity measurements reveal that the sensor is specific for Hg2+ even with interference by high concentrations of other metal ions. Three different environmental samples were analyzed by the sensor and the results were compared with that from an atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The developed sensor was demonstrated to achieve excellent detectability. It may be applied to development of ultrasensitive detection strategies.

AB  - Investments at the organismal level towards reproduction and growth are often used as indicators of health. Understanding how such energy allocation varies with environmental conditions may, therefore, aid in predicting possible responses to global climatic change in the near future. For example, variations in seawater temperature may alter the physiological functioning, behavior, reproductive output and demographic traits (e.g., productivity) of marine organisms, leading to shifts in the structure, spatial range, and abundance of populations. This study investigated variations in reproductive output associated with local seawater temperature along a wide latitudinal gradient on the western Italian coast, in the zooxanthellate Mediterranean coral, Balanophyllia europaea. Reproductive potential varied significantly among sites, where B. europaea individuals from the warmest site experienced loss of oocytes during gametogenesis. Most of the early oocytes from warmest sites did not reach maturity, possibly due to inhibition of metabolic processes at high temperatures, causing B. europaea to reabsorb the oocytes and utilize them as energy for other vital functions. In a progressively warming Mediterranean, the efficiency of the energy invested in reproduction could be considerably reduced in this species, thereby affecting vital processes. Given the projected increase in seawater temperature as a consequence of global climate change, the present study adds evidence to the threats posed by high temperatures to the survival of B. europaea in the next decades.

AB  - Seasonal dynamics of naturally occurring prokaryotes, viruses, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates in two hydro-geologically contrasting alpine karst springs were monitored over three annual cycles. To our knowledge, this study is the first to shed light on the occurrence and possible interrelationships between these three groups in karstic groundwater. Hydrological and microbiological standard indicators were recovered simultaneously in order to estimate surface influence, especially during rainfall events. Data revealed a strong dependence of the microbial communities on the prevailing hydrological situation. Prokaryotic numbers averaged 5.1 x 10(7) and 1.3 x 10(7) cells L-1, and heterotrophic nanoflagellate abundance averaged 1.1 x 10(4) and 3 x 10(3) cells L-1 in the limestone spring type (LKAS2) and the dolomitic spring type (DKAS1), respectively. Viral abundance in LKAS2 and DKAS1 averaged 9.4 x 10(8) and 1.1 x 10(8) viruses L-1. Unlike in DKAS1, the dynamic spring type LKAS2 revealed a clear difference between base flow and high discharge conditions. The virus-to-prokaryotes ratio was generally lower by a factor of 2-3, at higher average water residence times. Furthermore, the high prokaryotes-to-heterotrophic nanoflagellate ratios, namely about 4700 and 5400 for LKAS2 and DKAS1, respectively, pointed toward an uncoupling of these two groups in the planktonic fraction of alpine karstic aquifers.

AB  - The article deals with Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba) and larch (Larix decidua) forests of the orders Piceetalia and Athyrio-Piceetalia (Vaccinio-Piceetea) in Slovenia. A total of 934 releves of spruce, larch and fir forests within the Piceetalia and Athyrio-Piceetalia were collected from the literature. After resampling, 319 releves remained, originating from 28 associations. Classification revealed two major groups of spruce, larch and fir forests, one thriving on non-carbonate bedrock and the other on carbonate. We further divided forests on non-carbonate substrate into two major groups - one thriving at high altitudes and the other in lowlands, both assigned to Piceion abietis. The second major group contains mesophilous, species-rich communities found mostly on carbonate bedrock. This major group can be further divided into four groups. The group of secondary forest on sites of beech forests, as well as the group of forest found in frost hollows can be assigned to Abieti-Piceion. The group of herb-rich, mesophilous communities forming zonal spruce and larch forests can be assigned to Chtysanthemo-Piceion and the group of forests on boulder scree to Calamagrostio-Abietion. Analysis of structural, functional, phytogeographical and geomorphological features, as well as ecological conditions estimated by bioindicator values, demonstrated the usefulness of this classification.

AB  - The first objective of this study was to determine the bioaccumulation kinetics of pyrene in the soft tissues of Crassostrea gigas (mantle, muscle, gills, digestive gland, and the remaining soft tissues). As bivalves can biotransform hydrocarbons in more polar compounds (metabolites) that are more easily excreted, the second objective was to investigate the oyster capacity to metabolize pyrene into its metabolite, the 1-hydroxypyrene. To these ends, oysters were exposed 24 h to waterborne C-14-pyrene then placed in depuration conditions for 15 d. Oysters efficiently bioaccumulated pyrene in their soft tissues and equilibrium was reached within the exposure time. The metabolitel -hydroxypyrene was also detected in oyster tissues but represented only 4-14% of the parent pyrene. At the end of the exposure period, the gills and the mantle showed the highest pyrene proportion of total soft tissue content, i.e. 47% and 26%, respectively. After 15 d of depuration, the mantle contained 32% and 30% of the remaining pyrene and 1-hydroxypyrene, respectively. As C. gigas did not display a high capacity for metabolizing pyrene, it can be considered as a good bioindicator species to survey and monitor pyrene contamination in the coastal marine environment.

AB  - Chapultepec Forest is the largest and most visited urban green area (UGA) of Mexico City and for these reasons, the protection and conservation of this place is a relevant issue to maintain the generation of the environmental services and benefits that it provides. Despite the importance of this area, there is a lack of information about the horizontal structure and indicators of the tree stands located in this place, as well as for the rest of the UGA of the city and the country, although some floristic or sanitary conditions studies had been done in some of them. The aim of this paper was to determine the dendrological and dasometric characteristics of the stands at the 2nd section of Chapultepec Forest, according with the information obtained from a total tree inventory, complemented with 111 sampling sites of 500 m(2). The estimated mean of trees per site was 295/ha, the mean crown cover value was 27,19 m(2) and the canopy cover in the area exceeds 80% of the total surface. The mean basal area was 0,10 m(2) and the stems occupied 0,32% of the total surface. This data will provide basic indicators for the 2nd section tree stands and a reference for future research projects and characterization of UGA in the city. In addition, the information is basic to sustain the management that requires the urban forest of Mexico City.

AB  - An integrated approach for assessing the availability of groundwater under conditions of 'global-change' is presented. The approach is embedded in the DANUBIA system developed by the interdisciplinary GLOWA-Danube Project to simulate the interaction of natural and socio-economic processes within the Upper Danube Catchment (UDC, 77,000 km(2) and located in parts of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy). The approach enables the quantitative assessment of groundwater bodies (zones), which are delineated by intersecting surface watersheds, regional aquifers, and geomorphologic regions. The individual hydrogeological and geometrical characteristics of these zones are accounted for by defining characteristic response times and weights to describe the relative significance of changes in variables (recharge, groundwater level, groundwater discharge, river discharge) associated with different states. These changes, in each zone, are converted into indices (GroundwaterQuantityFlags). The motivation and particularities of regional-scale groundwater assessment and the background of GLOWA-Danube are described, along with a description of the developed methodology. The approach was applied to the UDC, where several different climate scenarios (2011-2060) were evaluated. A selection of results is presented to demonstrate the potential of the methodology. The approach was inspired by the European Water Framework Directive, yet it has a stronger focus on the evaluation of global-change impacts.

AB  - In the health care setting, drugs added to large volume parenteral solutions (LVPS) are routinely administered to improve therapeutic effects and provide a faster clinical response. The development of analytical techniques that permit the detection of incompatibilities between drugs and parenteral solutions is necessary to guarantee their correct association with minimum adverse effects. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been used as a biological indicator of sterilization and disinfection processes because it exhibits a high thermal stability and is easily detected using UV light and spectrofluorometry. The response of GFP structure and/or protonation state to physicochemical changes in the solution favors its potential use as a biosensor for drug stability in parenteral solutions. The stability of the diuretic drugs furosemide and aminophylline, individually or combined, added to parenteral solutions of 20% mannitol and 0.9% NaCl was monitored by absorbance and RP-HPLC immediately and after 20 h of storage at room temperature, with and without 1 h exposure to a strong oxidant, H2O2. Changes in GFP fluorescence intensity were evaluated under the same conditions for purified GFP added to aliquots of the drug/LVPS solutions. Results show that GFP fluorescence intensity was proportional to the loss in drug stability over time and thus may potentially be added to a lot sample of a drug/parenteral solution as an immediate on-site test for defective product.

AB  - Paleoenvironmental changes over the last 30 ka have been documented for the Nansha area, South China Sea, from the biomarkers and their carbon isotopic composition of 314 sediment samples from core 17962. The concentrations of marine lipids indicate that the paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic conditions were not stable in the Nansha area during the last glacial period. The accumulation rates of C-37 alkenones and C-30 alkyl diols show that marine paleo-productivity was higher during the last glaciation than in the Holocene, and correlate well with those of terrestrial biomarkers. Simultaneous variations in accumulation rates of marine biomarkers and terrigenous long-chain compounds during the last glacial period suggest that this enhancement of marine productivity was caused by an increase in terrestrial nutrient supply from the Sunda Shelf. The stable carbon isotopic composition of terrigenous long-chain compounds, such as n-alkanes (delta(13)C= -28.6similar to-34.2parts per thousand), n-alkanoic acids (delta(13)C=-27.1similar to-31.8parts per thousand) and n-alkanols (delta(13)C=-26.6similar to-35.3parts per thousand), indicates that these compounds were derived from C-3 plants, and the surrounding area of southern South China Sea was not dry during the last glacial.

KW  - CRITERIA
AB  - This review examines national and regional approaches and challenges to forest health monitoring in Australia. Divergent management priorities for forests and plantations within Australia have resulted in differing interpretations of what is meant by forest health. This in turn has influenced the approaches taken to monitoring forest health. The commercial forest sector has taken a simplistic approach, focusing on the surveillance of tree condition and the extent of damaging agents that directly affect tree productivity. Resources for this task are generally restricted to high-value plantations. In order to fulfil their obligations to sustainable forest management most State forestry agencies are committed to developing regional Sustainable Forest Management monitoring programs. At the federal level there is a commitment to complying with several international conservation agreements including the Montreal Process. Forest health in these programs tends to be poorly defined. Some States have established, or are planning monitoring programs based on intensive measurements in permanent sites or plots. While current forest health monitoring programs in Australia are slate-based, the need for coordination and compatibility of assessment and reporting systems is recognized. Several national and state fora exist, far example, the national Forest Health Committee and the state-based Forest Health Advisory Committees. These groups have the potential to develop and coordinate the linkage from the regional-based forest health monitoring programs up to the national level. A major driver of this process, however, will be individual State's priorities and available resources and funding.

AB  - Binocular depth inversion represents an illusion of visual perception that is sensitive to various behavioural and psychiatric conditions. It is affected by cannabinoids, reflecting associated changes in perception. The present study investigated the differences in binocular depth inversion of different classes of natural and artificial objects and the effect of synthetic Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Dronabinol) on these illusionary perceptions. Using this model, the effects of orally administered Dronabinol on binocular depth inversion were investigated in 17 healthy male volunteers. Pictures from natural and artificial objects were presented stereoscopically and the depth perception of the volunteers was scored in an operationalized way. The timecourse of the effects of Dronabinol on binocular depth inversion was analyzed with regard to the stimulus classes (natural and synthetic objects). Significant differences in binocular depth inversion of the different groups of stimuli were revealed. Objects with a higher degree of everyday familiarity were generally seen as more illusionary than those with a lower degree of everyday familiarity. A strong impairment of binocular depth inversion due to Dronabinol was found in most classes of objects. Analysis of different stimulus classes provides further information on the underlying perceptual processing of binocular depth inversion. An impairment of top-down processing of visual sensory data by Dronabinol is suggested. The anandamidergic system seems to be involved in areas of visual information processing.

AB  - In nursery plant production, optimum water use is important to maintain productivity and make this production environmentally sound. Water should be supplied when it becomes difficult to extract for the plant, at a bulk soil water potential threshold value that may vary with environmental conditions, species and substrate properties. The objective of this study was to determine the threshold value at which availability of water rapidly drops for three newly developed substrates to be used in the production of Prunus x cistena, Xylem water potential and potential at the soil-root interface were used as indices of water availability and were compared with bulk soil water potential. Water was easily available (no drop in xylem or soil-root interface water potential) from container capacity down to a bulk soil water potential of about-10 kPa when xylem water potential was used as an indicator and -8 kPa when the soil-root interface water potential was chosen as the indicator. No significant differences in the threshold values were found between substrates, consistent with the absence of differences in the substrate physical properties. The differences in water availability among substrates were consistent with an observed difference in salt content. The important variability observed in the threshold suggests that plant based measures may be preferred to soil based measures in assessing water availability in artificial mixes.

AB  - Total coliform bacteria have been chosen as the indicator organism. Coliform die-away experiments have been carried out in unpolluted sea water samples collected at about 100 m off the coastline and ender controlled environmental conditions. The samples were transformed into one litre clean glass beakers which were kept at constant temperature and were exposed to the solar radiation. The membrane filter technique was used for the coliform analysis. The temperature ranged from 20 to 40 degrees C and the dilution ratios ranged from 1/50 to 1/200.
   Coliform decay rate in the light has been expressed as the summation of the coliform decay rate in the dark and the decay rate due to solar radiation. The solar radiation required for 90 percent coliform removal has been found to range from 17 cal/cm2 to 40 cal/cm2 within the temperature range of 25 to 30 degrees C. Applying the linear regression analysis two different equations have been given for the high (I>10 cal/cm2.hour) and low solar intensity ranges in order to determine the coliform decay rate constant as a function of the solar intensity.
   T-90 values in the light have been found to follow log-normal distribution with a median T-90 value of 32 minutes. The corresponding T-90 values in the dark were found to be 70-80 times longer. Coliform decay rate in the dark has been correlated with the temperature.

AB  - This study examines correlates of reproduction in Lemur mongoz, an endangered prosimian primate with a history of poor captive reproduction. Male testicular growth and regression were quantified via testicular indices (TI). Although TIs could be used to predict male breeding condition, they were not indicators of ability to sire offspring. Serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) concentrations, along with vaginal cytology, were used to monitor female reproductive cyclicity. E2 and P profiles showed no abnormalities. An elevation of E2 with low P, approximately one estrous cycle length (31.4 days) prior to the onset of fertile cycles, was consistent with the phenomenon of "pseudoestrus" observed in other lemur species. The copulatory pattern, consisting of thrusting, multiple intromissions, single or multiple ejaculations, and no copulatory lock, was more complex than expected for an animal with a supposedly monogamous mating system. The preference for natural arboreal substrata during copulation suggests that enclosure furnishings may influence copulatory behavior. A 30% neonatal mortality rate tempered recent success in breeding L. mongoz at the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC). Although infant sex and parity of the mother were not predictive of neonatal mortality, mother's natal status was, with captive-born females having a 67% infant mortality rate, compared with 15% in wild-caught females. Based on these observations, a number of factors, including housing, behavior, and photoperiod, may be relevant to successful captive propagation of L. mongoz.

AB  - Given the importance of measuring QOL and the need for sound and efficient planning to improve and enhance the well-being of citizens, the objective of this study was to investigate QOL in rural areas of Tehran province, Iran. To this end, the relevant literature and secondary sources were used to develop a questionnaire whose validity was determined by a panel of experts. To the best knowledge of the authors, no similar study has assessed QOL in rural areas of Tehran province and none of them has compared objective and subjective QOL in rural areas. The findings showed that in terms of objective QOL, which indicates the minimum living standards, the villagers in Tehran province were in a moderate to high status, but in the subjective QOL, about 20% of the villagers were rated as poor. According to the findings, there was a significant difference between the residents of different rural areas of Tehran in terms of objective and subjective QOL at the 99% level, but the differences were not the same. This calls for policymakers' attention. In this regard, policies should be put on the planning agenda to reduce rural migration by adopting a coordinated approach to rural and urban development and improving the physical and environmental conditions of rural communities to provide welfare services and reduce the disparity between urban and rural areas.

AB  - Mild behavioral deficits, which are part of normal aging, can be early indicators of an impending Alzheimer's disease. Using the APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we utilized the Morris water maze spatial learning paradigm to systematically evaluate mild behavioral deficits that occur during the early stages of disease pathogenesis. Conventional behavioral analysis using this model indicates that spatial memory is intact at 2 months of age. In this study, we used an alternative method to analyze the behavior of mice, aiming to gain a better understanding of the nature of cognitive deficits by focusing on the unsuccessful trials during water maze learning rather than on the successful ones. APP/PS1 mice displayed a higher number of unsuccessful trials during the initial days of training, unlike their wild-type counterparts. However, with repeated trial and error, learning in APP/PS1 reached levels comparable to that of the wild-type mice during the later days of training. Individual APP/PS1 mice preferred a non-cognitive search strategy called circling, which led to abrupt learning transitions and an increased number of unsuccessful trials. These findings indicate the significance of subtle intermediate readouts as early indicators of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - It is acknowledged that human activities have initiated and increased steppe habitat loss and fragmentation in Northwest China. Carabid beetles are often used as bioindicators of environmental change because they are extremely sensitive to disturbance. We chose 42 landscapes (18 fragmented and 24 continuous) in two steppe types in Ningxia, Northwest China, to examine the influence of steppe fragmentation on carabid beetles. The results showed that the canonical correlation coefficient between carabid beetles and landscape fragmentation was greatest at a 7-km spatial scale in both desert and typical steppes. Furthermore, the response of carabid beetles to steppe fragmentation was species-specific in both desert and typical steppes. Steppe fragmentation in the desert steppe could significantly enhance the richness and abundance of carabid beetles, which contrasts with the typical steppe. Additionally, steppe fragmentation significantly increased the abundance of two dominant carabid beetles in the desert steppe only. Therefore, the effects of steppe fragmentation on carabid beetles were species-dependent and were also mediated by the plant community and microclimate in the different steppes. The redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that plant richness and cover were important factors affecting carabid diversity. Finally, these results provide experimental evidence and technical data for biodiversity conservation management in the steppes of Northwest China. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental pollutants affect fish species differently because their routes of exposure make them more critical to a specific group regarding foraging habits or food preferences. However, the association between local problems and environmental conditions makes a particular species more suitable for use in monitoring programs. Thus, this study compared muscle accumulation of metals (Al, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ti and Zn) and toxicogenetic damage to three neotropical species from the Itapemirim River Basin (Brazil) with distinct foraging habits and feeding preferences: Geophagus brasiliensis (benthopelagic - omnivorous); Harttia sp. (benthic - detritivorous); and Leporinus copellandii (pelagic - omnivorous). There was seasonal influence on muscle metal concentrations: Ba and Mn concentrations in G. brasiliensis, Cr in Harttia sp. and Zn, Al and Fe in L. copellandii increased during the rainy season. G. brasiliensis was the most sensitive species, since it had a statistically higher prevalence of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities, which was influenced by seasonality. This result might be an effect of its benthopelagic habits, which favors contact with a larger group of contaminants due to its interaction with both water column and sediment. The present study showed the differential sensitivity of fish species and that the combination of chemical analysis of pollutants with evaluation of toxicogenetic responses helps to choose the best species for field studies.

AB  - The availability of drinking water is one of the main determinants of quality of life, disease prevention and the promotion of health. Viruses are important agents of waterborne diseases and have been described as important markers of human faecal contamination. This study aimed to investigate viruses' presence as an indicator of drinking water quality in low-income communities in the Manguinhos area, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Three hundred and four drinking water samples (2L/each) were collected along the drinking water distribution-to-consumption pathway in households, as well as healthcare and school units. Water samples were collected both directly from the water supply prior to distribution and after storage in tanks and filtration units. Using qPCR, viruses were detected 50 times in 45 water samples (15%), 19 of these being human adenovirus, 17 rotavirus A and 14 norovirus GII. Viral loads recovered ranged from 5E+10 to 8.7E+10(6) genome copies/Liter. Co-detection was observed in five household water samples and there was no difference regarding virus detection across sampling sites. Precarious and inadequate environmental conditions characterized by the lack of local infrastructure regarding basic sanitation and waste collection in the territory, as well as negligent hygiene habits, could explain viral detection in drinking water in regions with a water supply system.

KW  - Shandong
AB  - Purpose
   Shandong is a thriving economic centre, being the third largest province by land area in China. It also has the second largest resident population of 99,470,000 and the third largest gross regional domestic product of RMB 6.8tn in 2016. The urbanisation rate of Shandong has been quickly expanding from 45 per cent in 2005 to 58 per cent in 2016. This paper aims to examine the urban development, performance and liveability of 17 Shandong cities through areas such as infrastructure, public services, education and environmental protection.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Building upon the theoretical underpinnings of China's five development concepts - innovation, coordination, green development, opening up and sharing, this paper has constructed the inaugural urban composite development for 17 cities based on 131 indicators across six environments, namely, scale and quality of economic activities, financial capacity, labour market flexibility and economic vibrancy, good governance, effective leadership and social stability, technological advancement and innovation capability, public service standards and quality of life improvement and resource conditions and environmental protection.
   Findings
   The empirical results show that Qingdao, Weihai and Yantai perform well in urban development, while the capital city Jinan only rank in the fourth position.
   Originality/value
   By identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of each city based on the perspective of ordinary city dwellers, this paper provides appropriate policy recommendations for policymakers to develop and optimise their economies and urban spaces.

AB  - Companies are looking for actual information regarding the productivity of their energy resources, as this production factor plays a distinct role in their value chain. The objective of this study is to develop processes to continuously measure energy performance, considering its full integration into an Extended Enterprise framework. The problem of energy efficiency is related to sustainability research, not only for its scarcity and environmental impact, but for the condition which necessitates defining efficiency as a dimension of operational performance. The production process is the fundamental unit where energy performance is measured, since the transformation of inputs into outputs occurs in processes. In the design of this study, energy performance is represented by a framework, a map of indicators, and a longitudinal input-output process model. The problem is influenced by the concept of enterprise efficiency, and direct and indirect energy efficiency indicators are developed to continuously monitor energy performance. Based on a demonstration of its application using Monte Carlo simulation to test the performance indicators, it is shown that the indicators can be integrated at three hierarchical levels: (i) energy efficiency by source; (ii) energy co-efficiency of the process; and (iii) energy co-efficiency of the extended enterprise. The result is a modular architecture showing how energy performance can be measured and integrated into a network of processes such as the extended enterprise.

LA  - English
AB  - The contribution of vegetables to food security and economic development in Colombia, as well as to environmental problems worldwide, justifies the interest to design sustainable production strategies for the agro-chain. This study was developed to evaluate the effect of the application of essential oils and agricultural inputs in chili peppers, beans and eggplants in Codazzi, Cesar, Colombia. The methodology included the compatibility analysis between pesticides used in these vegetables, and Lippia alba and Cymbopogon citratus oils in relation to their biocidal effect in vitro on native strains of Macrophomina phaseolina, Phytophthora capsici and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Applications of thiabendazole in an individual basis and combined with oils were carried out in the field. Physicochemical and microbiological indicators of soil, pests and diseases incidence and crop yield were measured. Oils controlled up to 97% of plant pathogens in vitro and exhibited compatibility with carbendazim and thiabendazole. In the field, up to 67% of disease control was observed with C. citratus + thiabendazole compared to the control (p = 0.00), yields were close to the regional average, and better microbiological and physicochemical soil conditions were observed. In conclusion, there are differences in the edaphic effect between treatments, as the agrochemical and the oil combinations were more favorable than the individual effect of each product on the variables evaluated. The above exhorts to continue soil evaluations with oils to elucidate the duration of the described effects.

AB  - This paper discusses the potentials of a mixed-methods approach to collecting, mapping, and analyzing cyclists' experiences. By starting from an ethnographic perspective, data was gathered from urban cydists in Quito, Ecuador to understand the contemporary factors that influence cyclists' experiences. This approach seeks to challenge how technical data on cycling can be collected and visualized. To comprehend the quotidian experiences of moving in the city, 75 photo-diaries were distributed to urban cycling activists in Quito. This paper uses data returned by 26 individuals who identify with the subcultural group of cycling activists in Quito that has a thick description of their experiences and circulation patterns accompanied by photos taken by the participants. After gathering photo-diaries, the data was digitally mapped using Google Earth and then subsequently quantitative mapping approaches were used to digitize and analyze the objective environmental correlates of experiences of cyclists. Activists took photographs and used tags to label experiences. These experiences were then labeled positive, negative, or neutral. By relating the experience points and the routes taken in the urban area, results reveal the importance of centrality, the bicycle lane network, and green space for a positive experience, demonstrating how a mixed-methods approach to experience data can contribute to a greater understanding of cycling conditions in the urban context.

AB  - Whether transgene flow from crops to cross-compatible weedy relatives will result in negative environmental consequences has been the topic of discussion for decades. An important component of environmental risk assessment depends on whether an introgressed transgene is associated with a fitness change in weedy populations. Several crop-weed pairs have received experimental attention. Perhaps, the most worrisome example is transgene flow from genetically engineered cultivated rice, a staple for billions globally, to its conspecific weed, weedy rice. China's cultivated/weedy rice system is one of the best experimentally studied systems under field conditions for assessing how the presence of transgenes alters the weed's fitness and the likely impacts of that fitness change. Here, we present the cultivated/weedy rice system as a case study on the consequences of introgressed transgenes in unmanaged populations. The experimental work on this system reveals considerable variation in fitness outcomes - increased, decreased, and none - based on the transgenic trait, its introgressed genomic background, and the environment. A review of similar research from a sample of other crop-wild pairs suggests such variation is the rule. We conclude such variation in fitness correlates supports the case-by-case method of biosafety regulation is sound.

AB  - This research aims at solving an environmental issue caused by the electric arc furnace dust (EAFD), a hazardous waste produced as a by-product of steel-making industry. The research proposes the use of EAFD in road construction, through mixing it with asphalt concrete mixture. As the resilient modulus is one of the key parameters in pavement design, it was chosen as indicator to evaluate the asphalt concrete mixture with EAFD. Experiments were conducted at 25, 40, and 55 degrees C using three different loading frequencies, 1, 4, and 8 Hz, so that the results can benefit as many countries as possible with different climate conditions. Five contents of EAFD (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 %) by volume of binder were studied. Results showed that the expected negative correlation between temperature and resilient modulus was not consistent. In particular, there was a higher response of resilient modulus for samples of asphalt concrete mixtures with more than 15 % of EAFD for temperature of 40 degrees C and loading frequency of 4 Hz as well as with more than 17 % of EAFD for temperatures of 40 and 55 degrees C and 8 Hz of loading frequency. Results also showed that the highest response of the resilient modulus was at 40 degrees C, both 4 and 8 Hz, and with percentages of EAFD higher than 15 %.

AB  - The landscape of disaster resilience indicators is littered with wide range of tools, scorecards, indices that purport to measure disaster resilience in some manner. This paper examines the existing qualitative and quantitative approaches to resilience assessment in order to delineate common concepts and variables. Twenty seven different resilience assessment tools, indices, and scorecards were examined. Four different parameters were used to distinguish between them-focus (on assets baseline conditions); spatial orientation (local to global), methodology (top down or bottom up), and domain area (characteristics to capacities). There is no dominant approach across these characteristics. In a more detailed procedure, fourteen empirically based case studies were examined that had actually implemented one of the aforementioned tools, indices, or scorecards to look for overlaps in both concepts measured and variables. The most common elements in all the assessment approaches can be divided into attributes and assets (economic, social, environmental, infrastructure) and capacities (social capital, community functions, connectivity, and planning). The greatest variable overlap in the case studies is with specific measures of social capital based on religious affiliation and civic organizations, and for health access (measured by the number of physicians). Based on the analysis a core set of attributes/assets, capacities, and proxy measures are presented as a path forward, recognizing that new data may be required to adequately measure many of the dimensions of community disaster resilience.

AB  - Amaranthus dubius is a common weed in crops of Phaseolus vulgaris in the central and western states of Venezuela. To evaluate the effect of interference on the growth of both species growing under different relative proportions in a replacement series model, the functional plant growth analysis methodology was used. The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions, in a completely random arrangement with nine consecutive samplings performed at five-day intervals. Five combinations of relative proportions were used (4: 0, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1 and 0: 4) with a total density of four plants per experimental unit, consisting of a light opaque container filled to a depth of 18 cm with sandy loam and surface area of 254 cm(2). At each harvest shoot dry weight and total leaf area of both species were measured. The natural logarithms of these variables were used to calculate for each relative proportion, the instantaneous values of relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf weight ratio (LWR) and specific leaf area (SLA). The leaf area duration (LAD) was calculated by the classic method. The results showed that intrinsic competitive success of P. vulgaris on A. dubius was mainly due to its higher LAD, higher seed size, and higher rate of emergence and seedling development, while the RGR was not a good indicator of the competitiveness ability of the species.

AB  - In this study, accumulation of H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA) (as cold-induced oxidative stress indicators), the transcript levels of dehydrin and beta-glucosidase genes (involved in metabolic responses) was evaluated in chickpea cv. Jam, using qRT-PCR during control, cold acclimation (CA), cold stress (CS), recovery, and freezing phases. Results showed the existence of wide range of genetic capacity in the cultivar to increase cold tolerance when environmental conditions change. Significant increase in H2O2 and MDA content during CA phase indicated that seedlings perceived cold signaling that resulted in remarkable increase in the transcript levels of dehydrin and beta-glucosidase genes as part of defense responses of plants. Balancing the expression of these genes and oxidative stress indicators showed the interplay between two major defense and injury pathways. During freezing phase, the higher transcript levels of these genes in acclimated plants compared to non-acclimated plants showed a more active role for plant cells. An incapability of defense machine in non-acclimated plants was a limiting factor determining the low potential of chickpea plants to freezing phase. It was suggested that adjustment and metabolic alterations like dehydrin and beta-glucosidase genes, especially after CA phase and, thereby, decrease in oxidative stress indicators, could be a reason for relative cold tolerance in chickpea.

AB  - The sensitivity of soil carbon and nitrogen to warming is a major uncertainty in projections of climate. However, previous studies about soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and potential emission predominantly concentrated on the shallow soil layer in high latitude ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed the SOC, total nitrogen (TN) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks, C/N ratios, and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) in the active layer and permafrost layer on the Eboling Mountain in the upper reach of Heihe River basin, northwestern China. Our results showed that the average stocks of SOC, TN, and SIC in permafrost layer above soil parent materials (71.7 kg m(-2), 8.0 kg m(-2), 34.7 kg m(-2)) were much higher than those in the active layer (44.3 kg m(-2), 5.3 kg m(-2), 12.2 kg m(-2)). The delta C-13 pattern in the soil profiles indicated that historical drainage conditions and pedogenesis were important factors in determining soil organic matter (SOM) stocks in this permafrost region. The delta C-13 and C/N ratios of the transient layer and some layers of permafrost implied that the degradation of SOM was different. These results highlight that carbon and nitrogen in permafrost regions with Alpine Kobresia meadow could make significant contribution to China's terrestrial carbon cycle.

AB  - Although the physiological strain index (PhSI) is universal and comprehensive, its restrictions are recognized in terms of invasive on-site measurements and the requirement of accurate instruments. The perceptual strain index (PeSI) has been proposed as a user-friendly and practical indicator for heat strain. However, the application of this index in assessing the heat strain of construction workers has yet to be examined and documented. This study aims to ascertain the reliability and applicability of PeSI in an experimental setting that simulates a stressful working environment (i.e., environment, work uniform, and work pace) experienced by construction workers. Ten males and two females performed intermittent exercise on a treadmill while wearing a summer work uniform at 34.5 degrees C and 75% relative humidity in a climatic chamber. Physiological parameters (core temperature, heart rate) and perceptual variables (thermal sensation, perceived exertion) were collated synchronously at 3 min intervals. The results of two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (clothing x time) revealed that the PeSI was useful in differentiating the heat strain levels between different work uniforms. Not only did the PeSI change in the same general manner with the PhSI, but it was also powerful in reflecting different levels of physiological strain. Thus, the PeSI offers considerable promise for heat strain assessment under simulated working conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abundant and diverse trace fossils occur in the littoral-neritic sediments recording an Early Devonian transgression in South China. The well-exposed Ganxi section is located in the Longmen Mountain 100 km northwest of Chendu, Sichuan. The Lower Devonian strata are dominated by sandstones, siltstones, muddy shales, limestones, bioclastic limestones, and muddy limestones. About thirteen ichnogenera were systematically described, including Arenicolites, ?Balanoglossites, Chondrites, Cylindrichnus, Diplocraterion, Planolites, Palaeophycus, Phycodes, Rhizocorallium, Rusophycus, Skolithos, Thalassinoides, and Zoophycos. Six trace fossil associations under different sedimentary environments have been recognized as follows: the Skolithos and Diplocraterion-Skolithos associations mainly consist of domichnia derived from a high-energy zone of the foreshore to upper shoreface; the Rusophycus-Phycodes association is characterized by fodinichnia and cubichnia generated in a lower-energy zone of the upper shoreface; the Chondrites-Palaeophycus association mainly consists of domichnia, chemichnia, and fodinichnia as indicators of the lower-energy and suboxic conditions of a coastal lagoon; the Rhizocorallium association includes feeding and dwelling burrows formed in a lower-energy zone of the upper offshore enriched with food; and the Zoophycos association is characterized by fodinichnia and pascichnia as indicators of the lower offshore frequently influenced by storm waves. The entire sequence shows several transgressive-regressive cycles from the Lochkovian to Pragian and much storm influence in the Emsian.

AB  - There has been a surge of interest over cases where a subject sincerely endorses P while displaying discordant strains of not-P in her behaviour and emotion. Cases like this are telling because they bear directly upon conditions under which belief should be ascribed. Are beliefs to be aligned with what we sincerely endorse or with what we do and feel? If belief doesn't explain the discordant strains, what does? T.S. Gendler has recently attempted to explain all the discordances by introducing a controversial new cognitive category-associative clusters called 'alief'. Others think that belief explains all the discordancy cases, while others argue that in-between belief does the trick, and so on. Most advocates of the different positions, indeed, assume that their favoured analysis will explain the whole range of discordancy cases. This paper defends what I call the 'contextual view', where I argue that overturning this assumption of uniformity leads to more nuanced account of belief-ascription. On the contextual view, which analysis applies to which case depends on the discordancy case at hand. Perhaps a height-phobic stepping on a glass platform deserves different treatment to a hesitant stepper. I ground the contextual view in a biologically functional account of the alief/belief distinction, which construes alief as a real cognitive category but without the explanatory reach Gendler gives it. This functional distinction yields a principled strategy for determining the correct application of analysis to discordancy case.

AB  - This paper sets out to explain how the implementation of an environmental management systems (EMS) conditions the way firms respond to environmental pressures exerted by their stakeholders. While the most common approaches to be found in the literature consider the certification of such systems to be an indicator of proactivity and cooperation with stakeholders, this article posits that it is also a mechanism firms use to discriminate between stakeholders, allowing firms to react to the pressure of certain stakeholders only. Specifically, the analyses conducted on a sample of 3748 plants reveal that the implementation of an EMS responds to pressure from stakeholders, but once this system has been certified a firm's environmental actions basically respond to the pressure from internal primary stakeholders, ignoring pressures from external primary and secondary stakeholders and regulators. The key element in the theoretical line of reasoning regarding these results is the opportunistic behavior associated with certification, given that the certification by itself represents incomplete information. Thus, an EMS can serve as a valuable shield against a majority of stakeholders, since only the pressure of those stakeholders who can verify the effects of such pressure will have an influence on the environmental behavior of firms with a certified EMS.

AB  - Background: Suicide and death by accidents in persons with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are common, but excess mortality from natural death accounts for even more years of life lost. The impact of somatic comorbidity, however, often is not duly considered in analyses and explanations of excess mortality in patients with psychotic disorders.
   Objective/Methods: This study investigates and evaluates the impact of 19 severe chronic diseases on excess mortality due to diseases and medical conditions (natural death) in individuals with psychotic disorders compared with the general population using a population-based cohort study in Denmark. Incidence/mortality rate ratios of admission/mortality were calculated using survival analysis.
   Results: Cohort members with psychotic disorders had higher incidence rates of hospital contacts for almost all of the 19 disorders than the general population. The mortality rate ratio (MRR) of natural death was 7.10 (95% CI 6.45, 7.81) for schizophrenic men, decreasing to 4.64 (95% CI 4.21, 5.10) after adjustment for the somatic disorders. The same pattern existed in women and in both genders with bipolar disorder. Highest MRRs were observed for psychotic patients without hospital admissions with the investigated somatic disorders.
   Conclusion: Chronic somatic diseases accounted for half of the excess mortality in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Chronic disorders investigated in this paper seem to be under-treated or under-detected among such patients.

AB  - Data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua spacecraft each day show tens of thousands of Cold Clouds (CC) in the tropical oceans with 10 am window channel brightness temperatures colder than 225 K. These clouds represent a mix of cold anvil clouds and Deep Convective Clouds (DCC). This mix can be separated by computing the difference between two channels, a window channel and a channel with strong CO2 absorption: for some cold clouds this difference is negative, i.e. the spectra for some cold clouds are inverted. We refer to cold clouds with spectra which are more than 2 K inverted as DCCi2. Associated with DCCi2 is a very high rain rate and a local upward displacement of the tropopause, a cold "bulge", which can be seen directly in the brightness temperatures of AIRS and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) temperature sounding channels in the lower stratosphere. The very high rain rate and the local distortion of the tropopause indicate that DCCi2 objects are associated with severe storms. Significant long-term trends in the statistical properties of DCCi2 could be interesting indicators of climate change. While the analysis of the nature and physical conditions related to DCCi2 requires hyperspectral infrared and microwave data, the identification of DCCi2 requires only one good window channel and one strong CO2 sounding channel. This suggests that improved identification of severe storms with future advanced geostationary satellites could be accomplished with the addition of one or two narrow band channels.

AB  - A new method using sedimentary metals and geographic information system as indicators for assessing temporal and spatial anthropogenic change in estuaries has been applied to a large coastal lake (Lake Macquarie) in New South Wales, Australia.
   Two vintages of data (1975 and 2003) on surficial sediment metal (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) concentrations combined with Pb-210 core profiles were used to determine past changes in sediment quality and to predict possible future relaxation rates for the entire lake area in response to change in anthropogenic pressure. Sediment cores showed distinct vertical profiles; sedimentation rates in the northern part of the lake were consistent (14 mm year(-1)) over the 55-year period investigated.
   Surficial metal concentrations were highest in the 1975 sediment than in the 2003 samples, with the northern part of Lake Macquarie having much greater metal concentrations than the rest of the lake. Past and future declining sedimentary metal concentrations in the northern part of the lake were expected due to the closure of a nearby Pb-Zn smelter; however, possible increases in Cu in the south of the lake to the year 2020 were surprising. The new method presented in this study can assist estuary managers by providing data on past, present and future conditions, which are essential in making informed decisions for the improvement of estuarine systems.

AB  - Coccolithophores were used as sensitive indicators for the present-day functioning of the Java upwelling area to better understand the key role of this region in the tropical Indian Ocean dipole mode. Sampling was conducted during the oligotrophic phase of the monsoonal cycle. At all sites low abundance coccolithophore communities were found with surface assemblages either dominated by Gephyrocapsa oceanica or Umbellosphaera irregularis or a diverse mixture including the two named species plus Palusphaera vandelii, Ophiaster hydroideus, Syracosphaera spp. and Calciosolenia spp. with no clear dominance of a single species. Below a well defined thermocline a deep-photic community was dominated by Florisphaera profunda, but also with high abundances of Algirosphaera robusta, Gladiolithus flabellatus and Oolithotus antillarum. In the sediments only 19 taxa. were found with the three species F profunda, G. oceanica, and E. huxleyi making up more than 90% of the assemblages. The observed living communities were part of the recurrent seasonal cycle and corresponded to the environmental conditions. The sediment assemblages distinctly differ from the living communities. Alteration effects appeared to be strong but were probably not the only cause for the biases between the living communities and the sediment assemblages. The communities during ongoing upwelling also significantly contributed to and determined the sedimentary assemblage. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is a species of conservation concern and an indicator of mature and old forest habitat conditions in the Pacific Northwest. The effects of natural and human-caused disturbance on density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and traditional home ranges were compared over 30 years in two areas and over 15 years in five additional areas. In one study area, density of nesting pairs of pileated woodpeckers decreased from five to one after extensive regeneration cuts eliminated most of the stands of mature and old-growth grand fir (Abies grandis) and reduced the density of nest and roost trees and foraging substrate since 1990. Density of nesting pairs, reproductive success, and home range location remained fairly consistent over 30 years in a second study area with extensive tree mortality resulting from insect outbreaks but without regeneration harvests. The amount of unharvested stands and closed canopy stands in home ranges were positively correlated with reproductive success, and the amount of area in harvested stands was negatively correlated with reproductive success in 2003-05. High tree mortality and subsequent loss of canopy closure in stands of grand fir and Douglas-fir from insect outbreaks did not appear to be detrimental to pileated woodpeckers provided that dead trees and logs were abundant and that stands were not harvested.

AB  - In order to assess the hazardous behaviour of wastes under field conditions, a proper understanding of the leaching of wastes is necessary to improve the, environmental impact assessment. The study of the leaching behaviour is performed using a compliance test, prEN 12457, which is currently being standardised. The leaching test provides information on changes in release as a function of the liquid to solid ratio (L/S). It is obtained in a two-step extraction procedure using water as leachant. Taking into account that compliance tests are used to determine whether the waste complies with limit values, it is necessary to study the release phenomena, controlling solubility versus availability by leaching.
   In this work, the leaching behaviour of foundry sludges using the compliance test prEN 12457 has been studied. The foundry sludges are generated from gas wet cleaning treatment, which in previous works were found to be hazardous wastes due to organic pollutants such as phenol and inorganic compounds such as Zn or other metallic elements. Results show the mechanism of leaching. Data expressed in mg Kg(-1) show availability check when data for different L/S ratios are the same organic pollutants (TOC and phenols). Constant data expressed in mg L-1 show solubility check for metallic pollutants (Zn, Pb, Ni and Cu). It must be emphasised that decision should be taken (e.g. as waste acceptance criteria for landfills) with respect to appropriate limit values.

AB  - In male birds, the gonadal hormone testosterone (T) is known to influence territorial and mating behaviour. Plasma levels of T show seasonal fluctuations which vary in relation to mating system and social instability. First, we determined the natural T profile of male blue tits Parus caeruleus during the breeding season. We found that plasma levels of T increased at the onset of nest building. Thus, the increase in circulating T was not associated with territory establishment, nor with the fertile period of the males' mates. In most individuals, T levels dropped to values close to zero during the period of chick feeding. Second, we investigated the relationship between plasma levels of T and male age, size, and singing behaviour. During the mating period, T levels did not differ between 1 yr old and older males and did not correlate with body size or condition. However, song output during the dawn chorus tended to be positively correlated with T levels. Therefore, if high T levels are costly, song output might be an honest indicator of male quality in blue tits. Finally, we show that plasma levels of T are significantly higher during the night than during the day. This pattern has also been observed in captive non-passerine birds, but its functional significance remains unknown.

AB  - This study compares a sample of 76 male and 100 female university students with the Bahraini sample which formed part of Michalos's 1984 global study of well-being.  Using MDT, temporal changes were explored in students' perceptions of their aspirations and actual living conditions after a decade of major social changes.  Within sample comparisons were made between males and females and those majoring in education and business to investigate the differences on the various discrepancies.  Regression results were at variance with those of 1984.  The Self/Needs gap (person-environment fit theory) had the greatest influence on Life Satisfaction, followed by Self/Wants and Self/Progress discrepancies.  The Self/Deserves gap (equity theory) had the greatest influence on Happiness followed by Self/Wants and Self/Progress.  The strong influence of social comparison (Self/Others gap) has been presently overtaken by needs and equity.  A socio-historical explanation was offered for these temporal changes in students' perceived gaps between what they have and aspire to.  This and other results regarding the effect of gender and specilization on perceived gaps suggest a useful link between wide gaps and objective social indicators.  The subjective meaning of Satisfaction and Happiness to a female sample was qualitatively
   highlight the centrality of religion as an ethical, social and cultural idiom.  Using the life meaning construct of Zika and Chamberlin (1992), religion seems to provide personal meaning, which in turn mediates to well-being.

AB  - Improvements to the classical inclusion-exclusion identity are developed.  There are two main results:  an abstract combinatoric result and a concrete geometric result.  In the abstract result conditions are given which guarantee the existence of a depth d + 1 identity or inequality for the indicator function of a union of a finite collection of events, that is, an expression which is a linear combination of indicator functions of at most (d + 1)-fold intersections of the events.  Such an identity or inequality can be integrated with respect to any probability measure to yield a probability identity or inequality.  Connections are given to previous work on Bonferroni-type inequalities.  The concrete result says that there is a depth d + 1 identity for the union of finitely many balls in d-dimensional Euclidean space.  With a single correction term this result also holds in the d-dimensional sphere.  These results form the basis for a discrete theory of tubes, which up to now has been continuous in nature.  The spherical result is used to give a simulation method for finding critical probabilities for multiple-comparisons procedures, and a computer program implementing the method is described.  Numerical results are presented which demonstrate that in the tails of the distribution probability estimates based on the method tend to exhibit less variability than estimates based on naive simulation.

AB  - This work aimed to characterize the gut and faeces bacterial communities (BC) of Porcellionides pruinosus using high-throughput sequencing. Isopods were collected from the field and kept in laboratory conditions similar to those normally applied in ecotoxicology tests. Faeces and purged guts of isopods (n = 3 x 30) were analysed by pyrosequencing the V3-V4 region of 16 S rRNA encoding gene. Results showed that gut and faecal BCs were dominated by Proteobacteria, particularly by an OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) affiliated to genus Coxiella. Diversity and richness values were statistically higher for faecal BC, mainly due to the occurrence of several low-abundance phylotypes. These results may reflect faecal carriage of bacterial groups that cannot settle in the gut. BCs of P. pruinosus comprised: (1) common members of the soil microbiota, (2) bacterial symbionts, (3) bacteria related to host metabolic/ecological features, and (4) bacterial etiological agents. Comparison of BC of this isopod species with the BC from other invertebrates revealed common bacterial groups across taxa. The baseline information provided by this work will assist the design and data interpretation of future ecotoxicological or biomonitoring assays where the analysis of P. pruinosus BC should be included as an additional indicator.

AB  - The paper presents the results of comparing the integral characteristics of ignition and combustion of coal and composite fuels, prepared from coal processing waste in a dry and wet state, in a model combustion chamber. We calculated the relative fuel performance coefficients, taking into account the established ignition delay times, fuel burnout duration, concentrations of gaseous anthropogenic emissions, as well as temperature changes (reduction at the initial stage and growth during rapid combustion) in the model combustion chamber. It was shown that the ignition delay times of coal processing waste in a dry state are 30-70% lower than in the initial wet state. However, burning wet coal processing waste provides the lowest concentrations of NOx and SO2 (5-44% lower than in a dry state and 35-70% lower than they are for coal). Considering the main environmental, economic and energy performance indicators, optimal conditions were established for the combustion of abundant coal processing waste as part of water-containing slurry fuels. It was established that the relative performance coefficient of slurry fuels ranges from 2.05 to 58.87 when varying the moisture content and component composition. This coefficient is maximum for wet filter cake without oil. This allowed us to conclude that wet coal processing waste is highly promising.

AB  - This paper presents a strategical project for the new version of the Moroccan energy policy. It highlights the technology of solar water heaters (SWH), studying energy, economic and environmental gains of SWH generalization to satisfy the total resident need proposing a new strategic version diversified in terms of adopted technologies (more than green electricity). A detailed analysis of thermal performances and economic profitability of direct thermosyphon solar water heaters (TSWH) for residential requirements in Morocco. The optimum design parameters were defined and investigated using the dynamic TRNSYS simulation program. The optimum system was simulated under the six climatic conditions of Morocco in order to assess the related performances in terms of the collector efficiency and solar fraction. The major finding of this work is that large-scale integration of TSWH into Moroccan residences could provide up to 70% of thermal energy loads. An economic study was also developed to predict the life-cycle savings generated by the generalization of this technology in Morocco for all residential building's categories. Approximately 1250 million USD as national saving on the total energy bill can be achieved. The environmental effects were also assessed to achieve the aims of this work and to evaluate the CO2 emissions avoided due to this environmentally friendly solution.

AB  - The article summarizes the characteristics of economically valuable features of a large set of chickpea samples in arid conditions of the steppe of Ukraine. The data on the spread of culture on our planet shows the positive impact of food made from its seeds on human health. A number of genotypes have been identified and described, which combine a significant number of important agronomic traits that are of significant value for breeding. Special attention in the research was paid to the identification of genotypes tolerant to elevated air temperatures and insufficient moisture in the soil. A brief description of the varieties created with the participation of exotic genetic plasma is given. As a result of many years of study of accessions of chickpea, sources of increased seed productivity, large seeds, high protein content, tolerance against pathogens, improved technological qualities of seeds have been identified. Individual genotypes have been identified in which several economically valuable indicators have been improved. It is shown that the combination of traits of samples of different ecological and geographical origin in one genotype has a high probability of obtaining valuable recombinant forms by accumulating positive adaptive genes. A particularly wide variation of breeding material is needed to prevent disease outbreaks and the widespread of pests, the danger of which increases significantly with the homogeneity of the gene pool.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of climate variability and change (CV&C), and energy policies on the future energy system in Australia. Scenarios were developed to represent CV&C impacts and policy options, which were analysed with the Long-range Energy Alternative and Planning system for the period 2010-2050. The results indicate that although energy demand is likely to increase threefold in the business-as-usual scenario, CV&C further increases demand to 150 petajoule. A combined policy option involving modal shift and penetration of electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles results in a 49-53% decrease in transport fuel demand and emissions. The economic analysis reveals a substantial decline in sales revenue and increase in generation costs due to CV&C impacts. Higher renewable energy integration results in lower wholesale electricity prices across independent electricity markets. Cumulative cost-benefit analysis indicates that economic benefits increase to US$4.9 trillion in an advanced renewable energy scenario. Emissions and energy consumed increased under climatic conditions, but decreased after policy intervention. Ignoring the influence of CV&C may result in underestimation of future energy demand and installed capacity in Australia. Therefore, energy and climate policies should consider long-term economic benefits over short-term system costs.

AB  - The potential impact of drought on the carbon balance in plants has gained great attention. Non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) dynamics have been suggested as an important trait reflecting carbon balance under drought conditions. However, NSC dynamics under drought and the response mechanisms of NSC to drought remain unclear, especially in water-limited savanna ecosystems. A precipitation exclusion experiment was performed to simulate different drought intensities in a savanna ecosystem in Yuanjiang valley in southwestern China. Growth, total NSC concentration and diurnal change of NSC were determined for the leaves and non-photosynthetic organs of three dominant species (Lannea coromandelica, Polyalthia cerasoides and Heteropogon contortus) throughout the growing season. Drought significantly reduced the growth of all the three species. Total NSC concentration averaged similar to 8.1%, varying with species, organ and sampling period, and did not significantly decrease under drought stress. By contrast, the diurnal change of NSC in these three species increased under drought stress. These results indicate that these three dominant species did not undergo carbon limitation. Thus, relative change in NSC is a more sensitive and effective indicator than carbon reserves in evaluation of plant carbon balance. These findings provide new insights for the understanding of carbon balance and the mechanisms of carbon starvation.

AB  - Mediterranean land use and land cover (LULC) have a very dynamic structure as a result of continuous transformation process due to anthropogenic effects and environmental gradients. LULC dynamics are important indicator of environmental condition in temporal and spatial scales. The aim of this paper was to simulate the future LULC of a Mediterranean type watershed located at the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey by incorporating multi-layer perceptron (MLP), artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) approaches. Landsat TM/OLI images in 1990, 2003 and 2014 over the study area were classified using hybrid classification approach. The Kappa statistics of the hybrid classification that combines K-means, decision tree and object based classification method for these three images were 0.81, 0.85 and 0.87 respectively. The LULC map of 2014 was simulated using LULC maps of 1990 and 2003 for calibration and validation. The simulation results were compared with the actual 2014 LULC map to assess the accuracy of the simulation, and the rate of overlap was found as 89%. LULC map of 2025 was estimated using LULC maps of 2003 and 2014. These results indicated that, the area of bareground will reduce 13.31% whereas the rate of forest and agricultural area will increase 8.70% and 6.51% respectively.

AB  - Behaviour is a good indicator of the well-being of chickens. The objective of the study was to compare foraging behaviour in males and females of three indigenous chicken strains under generally hot free-range conditions. Behavioural activities were monitored in 21-wk-old Potchefstroom Koekoek (PK), Ovambo (OV) and Naked Neck (NN) chickens. Birds were separated by sex and allocated to four pens of Chloris gayana. Three birds per pen were randomly chosen and marked with paint 20min before observation. Temperature humidity index (THI) was calculated and main effects analysed using the general linear models procedure. Naked Necks spent more time walking than OV and PK. Strain did not affect other behaviours. Females spent more time foraging, while males dominated standing and walking. There was negative correlation between THI and time spent foraging. There was interaction between strain and sex on time spent standing. Foraging and drinking behaviours were more prominent in the morning (07:00h) and late afternoon (17:00h) compared to the 12:00-h period, whereas preening and dust-bathing were dominant around mid-day. Strain, sex and THI influence behaviour in free-range chickens. Breeding programmes should be cognizant of these attributes in order to produce hardier birds in view of worsening climatic uncertainties.

AB  - The article develops a systematic approach to the management of mining, using, export and import non-metallic minerals for construction considering the economic parameters of the development of the world market situation and the domestic market.
   The analysis showed that the classification of minerals used by the Public Service Geology and Mineral Resources of Ukraine, the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine and Statistics of foreign economic activity - codes UKTZED - do not coincide that complicates the study process using these official sources.
   According to the results of the conducted researches, the indicators of the dynamics of minerals production in their natural and costly dimensions have been found to be inadequate. An analysis of dynamics and geographic structure of export-import operations was also conducted with natural sand, pebbles, gravel and breakstone. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that the approach to formation of export minerals' flows is not rational, because it poses a threat to the financial state of the mining industry and the country. An analysis of the geographical structure of the export and import of natural sand, pebbles, gravel and breakstone allowed proposing the use of a systematic approach to rational extraction, the use of the country's mineral resources base, while taking into account export-import flows and the price conditions of the external and internal markets and taking into account the resource component of state security.

AB  - The analysis of the failure processes and mechanisms of rockfalls that are associated with underground mining activities is presented. The study area is located in Kaiyang Phosphorite Mine in Southwest China, where the geological condition is dominated by anti-dip slopes with layers inclined backward into the natural slope with decreasing strength in the rock mass from the upper (dolomite-rich) to the lower (shale-rich) strata. The analysis is based on field investigation and laboratory experimental study using a gravitational simulation device. The results support the proposed failure mechanism by demonstrating the process of failure from the deformation of the roof and floor in the stopes, to the development of surface cracks near the top of slopes, and eventually to the formation of rockfalls as the surface cracks propagate along pre-existing joints. The rockfalls are classified into one of three failure modes: crack-toppling, crack-sliding, and crack-slumping, in which the failures are governed by the corresponding characteristics of the rock mass structure.

AB  - The Wronie nature reserve was established in 1978 for conservation of Pomeranian fertile beech forest Galio odorati-Fagetum (=Melico-Fagetum) outside of the natural range of European beech Fagus sylvatica. Reserve is located in Golub-Dobrzyn Forest District (53 degrees 18'39.52"N; 18 degrees 54'3.89"E; N Poland). The aim of our study was to determine the influence of passive protection for beech forest herb layer biodiversity. For our research, we used four series of phytosociological releves made in 1967, 1984, 1995 and 2005. To investigate changes in habitat conditions we used Ellenberg indicator values. Differences between years were analysed with ANOVA and Tukey test. In subsequent years, the frequency and cover of non-forest species, mainly from Epilobietea, Artemisietea, Trifolio-Geranietea and Molinio-Arrhenatheretea classes increased. This is caused by the increase in light availability, as result of disturbances in the tree stands (windthrow, oak decline, insect gradation). Light is the only Ellenberg coefficient that has significantly changed during 38 years (fig., tab. 2). Increase of light availability had no effect on biodiversity of forest herb species from Querco-Fagetea class. In comparison, with other studies in similar forest communities, our results suggests that passive protection might give different effects on biodiversity in similar forest communities, depending on tree stand dynamics.

AB  - Wood combustion on a local scale may cause the emissions of more than 100 different toxic and carcinogenic substances. Therefore, it appears that biomass combustion paradoxically involves the risk of environmental contamination and poses a threat to human health. This occurs under unfavorable conditions or due to the use of combustion technology unsuitable for a given fuel. Fuel combustion in low power boilers is carried out with the use of fuels with highly diversified technical and elementary parameters, and the economic aspect is for households ever more frequently to be a determinant of the form and quality of the combusted fuel, regardless of the boilers within which the fuel undergoes thermal conversion. The aim of the research was to determine the concentration of contaminations emitted during the combustion of pellets made of Virginia mallow biomass in a 32 kW boiler with automatic fuel loading adapted for wood pellet combustion on a test bench. The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAHs and benzo(a)pyrene B(a)P was determined, the indicators of emitted contaminations were specified, and the concentration of VOC (methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, n-butane, and pentane) in flue gases was defined. The determined indicators of emission for 16 PAHs equaled: 2.9 mg.kg(-1), i.e. 170.0 mg.GJ(-1), and for B(a)P 0.03 mg.kg(-1), i.e. 1.8 mg.GJ(-1).

AB  - Upland birds that display grit ingestion behavior are potentially at risk of detrimental effects and death from lead poisoning at trap and skeet ranges and other areas where vast quantities of spent lead shot pellets abound. Because commonly cited force-feeding pellet exposure studies deviate from true field conditions, their results may not reflect true risks faced by upland birds. In particular, studies that use new shot pellets and administer more pellets than would be reasonably ingested, critically interfere with the understanding of actualized pellet exposures. In this study, northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), a frequent test species in shot pellet research, were dosed in an ecologically-relevant manner (i.e., with spent shot and with no more than three pellets). Notably, the 56-day post-dosing observation period, during which a battery of physiological measures were recorded, exceeded that of related studies. Despite a sustained suppression of a lead poisoning indicator, the data suggest upland birds can withstand spent shot pellet exposures. Data detected a survivorship 95%, absence of illness, demonstrated tolerance for extremely high blood lead concentrations, and unaffected blood parameters. In conjunction with ecological considerations (e.g., spatial scale and animal behavior), concern about bird population losses from the incidental ingestion of spent shot pellets is potentially overstated.

AB  - Analysis of the honey enzymes diastase and invertase is one important parameter in honey quality control. Limits for enzyme activity are given by food legislation or directives of national brands, because enzyme activity is one of the measures of adequate conversion of nectar to honey during the ripening process. In addition, certain activity levels of invertase or diastase activity can also act as indicators for heat damage of honey samples. Depending on the botanical origin, enormous differences in enzyme activity can be observed, even though the enzymes are mostly added by the bees. We therefore collected nectar and honey samples during the ripening process of honey and investigated enzyme activity depending on the floral source. Based on the analysis of nectar samples, we could demonstrate that floral source and environmental conditions affect the total sugars and sucrose concentration. We therefore hypothesized that the composition of the nectar, especially the amount of sucrose, may interact with the activity of invertase. We found that correlation between sucrose concentration and invertase activity is highly significant during the ripening process of honey (p < 0.0001) confirming an interaction between these two parameters. This effect was further substantiated by a sugar feeding experiment with defined sucrose concentrations. Possibly a high turn-over at high sucrose concentrations may lead to enzyme exhaustion for invertase.

AB  - The paper develops a sustainable development framework for individual and collective capabilities in mixed subsistence and wage-based economies. We apply this framework to such regions of the Arctic and evaluate interactions and conflicts between two sectors of the mixed economy and between current and future generations of Arctic inhabitants. A recent Arctic Social Indicators Report published by the Arctic Human Development Report (AHDR) Task Force recognizes the importance of the mixed economy in the Arctic and aims to integrate collective assets, as well as individual assets in order to understand the human development in the Arctic. Yet due to its concerns of comparability of social development and data availability across the whole Arctic region (of which some parts do not have the similar population structure), its proposed indicators are not capable of covering the social development of predominantly indigenous regions of the North. We emphasize the importance of tracking collective capabilities, as well as individual capabilities to sustain community development. In addition we suggest that environmental sustainability, which is ignored by the AHDR Task Force, has to be integrated with social development as environmental deterioration significantly influences the social well-being and cultural stability of traditional inhabitants of the Arctic. We critically review the proposed indicators of the AHDR Task Force and make supplementary and alternative suggestions.

AB  - The simultaneous and direct determination of nickel and iron in plants and lichens has been investigated using high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The primary resonance line for nickel at 232.003 nm and the adjacent secondary line for iron at 232.036 nm have been used for this purpose. The optimization of the experimental conditions was performed using a pine needles certified reference material (SRM 1575a). The influence of pyrolysis and atomization temperatures, the amount of solid sample introduced into the graphite furnace and the use of aqueous or solid standard for calibration were studied. The spectral interferences caused by absorption of the concomitants of the solid sample were detected and corrected using a least square algorithm. Aliquots of 0.1-1 mg of the solid samples were weighed onto the solid sampling platforms and analyzed directly, without addition of any reagents. The limits of detection were 25 mu g kg(-1) for nickel and 0.40 mg kg(-1) for iron and the precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation, ranged from 7% to 12%. The proposed method was used to determine both metals in different bioindicator samples with successful results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the geotechnical field, the risk related to slope instabilities or collapse of geotechnical structures are increasingly being faced by early warning systems, capable of: (1) predicting the incipient collapse based on the interpretation of a continuous monitoring of the structure and (2) spreading alarm promptly to reduce people exposure. Compared with structural approaches, early warning systems have two important advantages: a faster, simpler and less expensive implementation and environmental compatibility. Past experience indicates that vulnerability of earth dams is generally low under both static and seismic loading conditions. In spite of this, earth dams are characterized by a high-risk level, due to the high exposure factor. Nowadays, the application of early warning systems to dams is fully supported by the technological progress achieved in the telecommunication field, since it is possible to install and automate recordings and transmission of all physical variables significant to check dam safety: accelerations, displacements, pore-water pressures, total stresses, seepage flows. A considerable lack still arises in the predictive models for interpreting monitoring data and providing indicators on dam safety soon after a strong earthquake. The present work illustrates the basic concepts of an earthquake early warning (EEW) system for earth dams and the main features that should characterize a predictive model to such a scope. An application to a real case is finally provided, enhancing the role played by each monitored physical variable for the aims of EEW.

AB  - The current study provides evidence supporting a sea-level drop of up to about 50 +/- 20 cm at the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean basin during the period AD 900-1300. The estimate is based on a variety of archaeological remains, mostly from the Crusader period, compared with other archaeological and biological proxies of sea level from the periods before and after.
   The Crusader low levels overlap the period known as the 'Medieval Warm Period' (MWP) or the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA). On the basis of published data it appears that a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase coincided with a negative Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the former affecting the temperature and freshwater flux in the Mediterranean Sea and most of its rivers, and the latter affecting the Nile outflow. Changes of 0.125 psu in salinity and 0.4 degrees C are estimated as upper limits for the change, and these are expected to cause a sea-level drop consistent in magnitude with the observed values. These provide the upper limit for a regional climate-forcing attribution of the observed sea level low. The possibility of crustal uplifts contributing to the observed changes is also discussed.

AB  - Five soil size aggregate fractions, corresponding to coarse (500-840 mu m), medium (200-350 mu m), fine (75-200 mu m) sand, silt (10-75 mu m) and clay (<4 mu m), were artificially contaminated with diesel, and thermally treated using a laboratory scale apparatus to investigate the effect of soil texture on contaminant adsorption and removal. Ex situ thermal process was simulated using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 L min(-1), different temperatures (100-300 degrees C) and different treatment times (5-30 min). The amount of contaminant adsorbed on the soil and the residual amount after thermal treatment was determined by gas chromatography. Results showed that adsorption phenomena and desorption efficiency were affected by the soil texture and that temperature and time of treatment were key factors in remedial process. A temperature of 175 degrees C is sufficient to remedy diesel polluted sandy and silty soils, whereas a higher temperature (250 degrees C) is needed for clays. Thermal desorption of diesel polluted soil was shown to be governed by first-order kinetics. Results are of practical interest and may be used in scaling-up and designing desorption systems for preliminary cost and optimal condition assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stakeholder engagement, collaboration, or participation, shared learning or fact-finding, have become buzz words and hardly any environmental assessment or modelling effort today can be presented without some kind of reference to stakeholders and their involvement in the process. This is clearly a positive development, but in far too many cases stakeholders have merely been paid lip service and their engagement has consequentially been quite nominal. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that better decisions are implemented with less conflict and more success when they are driven by stakeholders, that is by those who will be bearing their consequences. Participatory modelling, with its various types and clones, has emerged as a powerful tool that can (a) enhance the stakeholders knowledge and understanding of a system and its dynamics under various conditions, as in collaborative learning, and (b) identify and clarify the impacts of solutions to a given problem, usually related to supporting decision making, policy, regulation or management. In this overview paper we first look at the different types of stakeholder modelling, and compare participatory modelling to other frameworks that involve stakeholder participation. Based on that and on the experience of the projects reported in this issue and elsewhere, we draw some lessons and generalisations. We conclude with an outline of some future directions.

AB  - Temporal dynamic of several microbiological properties in two trace element polluted soils with different pH (soil A pH 4 and soil B pH 7) under the influence of various by-products during a 40-week-period was studied. The experiment was carried out in microcosms under controlled conditions. For each soil four treatments were established: biosolid compost (BC), fresh "alperujo" (AL), sugarbeet lime (SL), and a control (C) without by-product addition. Soil was sampled eight times during the experiment. The microbiological properties studied were: microbial biomass C (MBC), dehydrogenase, arylsulphatase and protease enzyme activities. Different fractions of organic C were also evaluated. In acid soil increases in pH caused by the addition of the alkaline by-products (SL and BC) decreased trace element availability and slight improved biochemical status during the first weeks of incubation. Although the reduction of trace element availability was not as effective as in the case of alkaline amendments, AL produced higher increase of WSC that stimulated biological activity. In neutral soil, with low trace element availability, the addition of by-products did not cause any change. Nonetheless, in this soil microbial biomass and activities were generally higher in by-product treated soil compared to control. Remediation practices had a positive and significant effect on enhance microbial activity in the contaminated soil. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, diverse liquid biofuels of the first generation were compared as partial or infant substitutes for fossil diesel fuel applied in cogeneration plant of the average capacity of 340 kW. The study concentrates on agricultural and economic conditions as well as legislative basis distinctive to Lithuania. At the laboratory of the Lithuanian University of Agriculture Institute of Agro-Engineering an experimental diesel engine powered generator was fuelled with rapeseed oil methyl ester (pure and in the blend with fossil diesel and dyed diesel fuels) and rapeseed oil with excellent energy balances and emissions characteristics more favorable than fossil diesel. Detailed estimations were proposed in order to assess the economic feasibility of complementing renewable electricity and heat generated in the final output cycle. The carried out analysis showed, that good perspectives are forecasted for using diesel engines in cogeneration plants, if they run on rapeseed oil produced by farmers themselves. The operation of such a plant would realize 184960 of (sic) annual income for sold electricity, allowing to pay annual depreciation expenses and exceed the production cost for thermal energy to be 0.033 (sic)/kW h. This price lies under the established one by the centralized energy suppliers, accordingly 0.058 (sic)/kW h. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lodging results in serious yield and quality reductions in foxtail millet (Setaria italica). Among summer crops, foxtail millet is a high density and soft stalked crop that is prone to lodging. Field selection for lodging resistance is difficult because the occurrence of lodging depends on the environmental conditions. A practical method for the evaluation of lodging is not available for foxtail millet, so an understanding of lodging-associated traits and identifying a suitable method to assess lodging are essential to select for lodging resistance and to predict the risk of lodging in a cultivar. In the present study, six stem and root traits associated with lodging was measured in the field and lodging coefficients were determined to evaluate lodging resistance in landrace and improved cultivars. Based on the results of correlation analysis, lodging coefficient is a suitable indicator for field selection for lodging resistance in both classes of cultivars tested for breeding purpose. Statistical analyses demonstrated that lodging was associated with stem quality rather than plant height and internode length at the stem base. The most important trait that directly impacted on lodging coefficient was mechanical strength of the stem and plant height in the landraces, while the weights of the above- and under-ground tissues, in combination with mechanical strength of the stem, were the most important contributors to lodging coefficient in the improved cultivars.

AB  - The particles in the examined cyclone fly ash were all smaller than 0.25 mm. in diameter, and particles smaller than 0.075 mm. in diameter accounted for 88.4% of the ash weight. This result indicates that cyclone fly ash consists of particles with a small diameter. The metals in the cyclone fly ash were enriched in small particles. The highest concentrations for zinc, copper, lead, cadmium and molybdenum in the cyclone fly ash were found in the smallest particle size fraction (< 0.075 mm.) and for Barium, chromium, nickel, Vanadium and Cobalt in the second to smallest particle size fraction (0.075-0.125 mm.). From an environmental and toxicological standpoint, the smallest particles are of the greatest concerti when ash is handed at landfill disposal sites (transport and disposal especially in stormy weather conditions), and some studies have reported risks to workers from prolonged exposure to ash. The results of the comparison of various dissolution methods for metals showed that the digestion procedures with nitric acid alone (USEPA 3051) or with a mixture of nitric acid + hydrogen peroxide (USEPA 3050B) slightly underestimated the metal concentrations in the cyclone fly ash. Although the use of hydrofluoric acid is often necessary for the determination of a number of elements associated with siliceous minerals, its use can result in loss of trace elements during dissolution.

AB  - The crystal darter, Crystallaria asprella (Jordan), is a benthic, riverine specialist, rare throughout its range and critically imperiled in the state of Mississippi. Construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway has fragmented a once continuous population of this species into several subpopulations in remaining, free-flowing tributaries of the system. In spite of this fragmentation and population subdivision, we collected numerous individuals from the waterway during summer 2004 and 2005. Because of the lentic conditions in the waterway, we questioned whether a dietary shift accompanied darters occupying this new environment. We also obtained museum specimens from the Tombigbee River before waterway construction and quantified and compared diets among the historical, tributary (contemporary) and waterway specimens. We hypothesised that waterway specimens would differ significantly in diet from both historical and tributary specimens, and that the latter two groups would have similar diets. Multiresponse permutation procedures indicated that all three groups were significantly different from each other and indicator species analysis identified significant indicator taxa for waterway and tributary specimens. Using a null model approach, dietary overlap was significantly greater than expected for tributary and waterway specimens, and significantly less than expected for waterway and historical specimens. Dietary plasticity was evident for crystal darters across space and time, but it remains unknown whether waterway individuals represent a population sink or are actively dispersing from nearby population sources.

AB  - Urbanization alters stream hydrology, hence flooding frequency and duration in floodplain wetlands. Potential impacts include shifts in species composition and survival, making restoration and selection of wetland species difficult. Cephalanthus occidentalis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Quercus shumardii seedlings were subjected to experimental flooding regimes typical of floodplain forests in rural and urban settings. Treatments included a rural flood regime with three 7-day floods, an Urban-short flood regime with six 4-day floods, and an Urban-long flood regime with six 10-day floods over a growing season. Specific responses, measured by stem length, leaf area, and leaf, stem, and root biomass, varied between species from different wetland indicator classes. C. occidentalis, a wetland obligate, was well adapted to both urban flooding regimes, whereas productivity of F. pennsylvanica, a facultative wetland species, and Q shumardii, a facultative species, was significantly reduced by the Urban-long treatment. Growth rates also varied over time, indicating the importance of temporal flooding patterns on species productivity. Because urban flooding regimes directly and selectively alter species productivity, proper restoration methods in urbanizing environments should include species selection based on current and potential future hydrologic conditions and use of reference standards from reference sites subjected to similar urban hydrologic regimes.

AB  - Rock glaciers are found in the peripheral regions of Antarctica particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Study of these features is relevant for the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of maritime Antarctica because they are indicators of permafrost and periglacial conditions. This paper reports and analyzes the results of an inventory of rock glaciers and protalus lobes in the South Shetland Islands. Nine rock glaciers and eleven protalus lobes have been identified. All of them are located in recently deglaciated zones between 300 m a.s.l. and sea level and they cover an area of 497 x 103 m(2). Tongue-shaped rock glaciers are more common than lobate types, being in general of medium and small sizes. They are talus rock glaciers (55%) and debris rock glaciers (45%), according to the genetic classification. The lack of a preferred orientation suggests that there is no significant microclimate control on their distribution. They are related to particular morphodynamic situations. Estimated annual velocities, based on relationships with raised beaches and transported debris volumes, range between 2.4 and 97 cm year(-1), within the ranges reported for other rock glaciers. Three groups of rock glaciers can be recognised: (a) those immediate postdating the last major ice recession, (b) rock glaciers younger than 2000 years BP but pre-dating the Little Ice Age (LIA), and (c) rock glaciers formed during the LIA.

AB  - Data-driven methodologies are among the most effective tools for damage detection of complex existing buildings, such as heritage structures. Indeed, the historical evolution and actual behaviour of these assets are often unknown, no physical models are available, and the assessment must be performed only based on the tracking of a set of damage-sensitive features. Selecting the most representative state indicators to monitor and sampling them with an adequate number of records are therefore essential tasks to guarantee the successful performance of the damage detection strategy. Despite their relevance, these aspects have been frequently taken for granted and little attention has been paid to them by the scientific community working in the field of Structural Health Monitoring. The present paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a multistep strategy to drive the selection of meaningful pairs of correlated features in order to support the damage detection as a one-class classification problem. Numerical methods to reduce the number of necessary acquisitions and estimate the performance of approximation techniques are also provided. The analyses carried out to test and validate the proposed strategy exploit a dense dataset collected during the long-term monitoring of an outstanding heritage structure, i.e., the Church of 'Santa Maria de Belem' in Lisbon.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are important in sediment production of coral reef environments and are excellent indicators of water quality and reef health. There is a lack of precise information about the foraminifer's fauna of the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf. In this study, sediment sampling was performed in June 2019 from two coral stations of Naz Island and Zeytoon Park. The surface sediment with three replicates for each location was collected using a mini corer and then were fixed in 70% ethanol. In this study, thirty species belong to 23 genera and 19 families of foraminifer's assemblages were identified based on morphological characters. Our results indicated that Foraminiferal assemblages were similar in both sampling localities. Quinqueloculina was the most abundant genera for both Naz Island and Zeytoon Park. Foraminifer's frequency of Zeytoon Park was higher than Naz Island. Symbiont-bearing foraminifera (e.g. Peneroplis) were observed just in Zeytoon Park. Higher frequency and the presence of symbiont-bearing foraminifera possibly indicate that Zeytoon Park has a more favorable condition for the coral reef growth in the future. Finally, we recommend that the structure of the foraminifer's community could be used as an early warning system for water quality around coral reefs and in particular, would help resource managers make better decisions about protecting coral habitats.

AB  - The present study has been undertaken to assess the corrosion and scaling potential of groundwater quality in Gonbad-e Kavus. The water quality indicators used were temperature, pH, total hardness, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), Cl-, SO42-, and Ca2+. The important of water quality indices including Langelier saturation index (LSI), the Ryznar stability index (RSI), aggressiveness index (AI), Puckorius scaling index (PSI), and Larson-Skold index (LRI) has been investigated for 20 water wells supplying the drinking water of study area in 2018. The mean values of LSI, RSI, AI, PSI, and LRI were obtained to be 0.15 +/- 0.01, 7.0 +/- 0.06, 10.12 +/- 1.49, 6.18 +/- 0.08, and 0.41 +/- 0.05, respectively. The result of the preset study showed that all water resources in Gonbad-e Kavus were corrosive based on the RSI, AI, and PSI indices. But according to LSI, water of the resources was scale forming. LRI index was in not corrosive condition. Therefore, water in these areas will need a special attention. This study demonstrated the application of water quality indices for the estimation water chemical stability and appeared to be promising techniques regarding water quality management that would be useful to environmental experts and policymakers for proper management and treatment of water.

AB  - The objective was to determine a methodology for the in vitro propagation of nodal segments of Dahlia sp. Sodium hypochlorite (0.5 and 1 %) was used for the in vitro establishment on immersion times (10, 20 and 30 min). The percentage of established, contaminated and necrotized explants was evaluated. In the multiplication doses of gibberellic acid (AG3) were used: 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1 and was evaluated the number of shoots/explants, number of segments/explants, number of leaves and height of the plant (cm). Different concentrations of indolacetic acid were studied: 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg L-1. The variables were percent of rooted seedlings, number of roots/bud, occurrence and root length. A completely randomized design with simple classification variance analysis was applied. The Tukey means comparison test was performed for a significance level of 5 %. The results obtained with 0,5 % sodium hypochlorite for 30 minutes was the most favourable, with a 60 % survival rate. An increase in plant height was obtained, as well as in the number of segments/explants with 1 mg of gibberellic acid. It was shown that with 0.5 mg L-1 of indolacetic acid, 87.5 % of explants were rooted and generated the largest number of roots in a 30-day period. Acclimatization above 80 % was archieved wich is an indicator that the plants were changed to overcome the changes to natural conditions.

AB  - In recent times two or more desalination processes have been combined to form integrated systems that have been widely used to resolve the limitations of individual processes as well as producing high performance systems. In this regard, a simple integrated system of the Multi Effect Distillation (MED)/Thermal Vapour Compression (TVC) and Permeate Reprocessing Reverse Osmosis (PRRO) process was developed by the same authors and confirmed its validity after a comparison study against other developed configurations. However, this design has a considerable amount of retentate flowrate and low productivity. To resolve this issue, two novel designs of MED and double reverse osmosis (RO) processes including Permeate and Retentate Reprocessing designs (PRRP and RRRO) are developed and modelled in this paper. To systematically assess the consistency of the presented designs, the performance indicators of the novel designs are compared against previous simple designs of MED and PRRO processes at a specified set of operating conditions. Results show the superiority of the integrated MED and double permeate reprocessing design. This has specifically achieved both economic and environmental advantages where total productivity is increased by around 9% and total retentate flowrate (disposed to water bodies) is reduced by 5% with a marginally reduced energy consumption.

AB  - The participation of microorganisms in construction and destruction of sedimentary structures is widely recognized, and so is the importance of studying such geological processes in modern systems, where the conditions, participating forces, and the results can be observed and recorded. This information is important for understanding and interpreting corresponding processes if their effects were preserved as part of the fossil record. The present contribution refers to topics discussed during the 9th International Bioerosion Workshop in Rome on Oct. 23-27, 2017, dedicated to the evaluation of microbial traces as paleoecological and paleobathymetric indicators. The paper reviews the habitats, methods of collection, and preparation of samples, followed by observation of extracted microbial euendoliths. This approach is complemented by producing images of three-dimensional display of inhabited microborings in their original positions using resin-casting and double embedding of the microbially invaded substrates. This contribution stresses the value of recognizing the microboring organisms' identities as a key aspect of the interpretation of their traces. It discusses different and complementary ways of how to achieve such parallel assessments. It reports on the importance of photo-documentation and morphometric evaluation of microbial populations, while avoiding possible artefacts caused by the methods used. The study also briefly summarizes the distribution patterns of microboring organisms and their boring and etching traces along depth profiles. Problems arising in the naming of complex traces and the relation to biological nomenclature are discussed.

AB  - Understanding fish larval development is of a great interest for aquaculture production efficiency. Identifying possible indicators of fish larvae stress could improve the production and limit the mortality rate that larval stage is subjected to. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and heat-shock factors (HSFs) are well known as indicators of response to many kinds of stressor (e.g., environmental, morphological, or pathological changes). In this study, golden pompano larvae were raised at different temperatures (23 degrees C, 26 degrees C, and 29 degrees C), as well as three different diets (Artemia nauplii unenriched, Artemia nauplii enriched with Nannochloropsis sp., and Artemia nauplii enriched with Algamac 3080), and the expression of HSP60, HSP70, HSF1, HSP2, and GRP94 were monitored. While stress genes were widely expressed in the larval tissues, HSP60 and HSP70 were principally from the gills and heart; HSF1 principally from the muscle, brain, and heart; and GRP94 principally from the head kidney and spleen. Golden pompano larvae were found to be more sensitive to thermal changes at later larval stage, and 29 degrees C was showed to likely be the best condition for golden pompano larval development. Nannochloropsis sp.-enriched Artemia nauplii treatment was found to be the most appropriate feed type with moderate relative expressions of HSP60, HSP70, HSF1, HSF2, and GRP94.

AB  - The preservation of decorated caves is a great challenge that has been reinforced by the microbial crisis occurring at emblematic sites such as the Lascaux and Altamira caves. To date, little is known about the microbial behavior of caves. One difficulty is that the term cave covers a wide variety of sites and structures. Past studies concentrated on caves with microbial disorders and were generally carried out in a time frame that was too short to gain an adequate picture of healthy microbial behaviors, the sine qua non of detecting potential imbalance. The aim of this study was to determine whether models of aerobiological behavior could be identified in several decorated caves. We monitored aerial rates of fungi and bacteria in five decorated caves of the Gard department (France) for periods of 2years or more. A model behavior was identified in each cave. These models were cave dependent and were also season dependent in some caves. Following our fungal results, we suggest separating the caves into two groups. The caves which were strongly affected by the external environment throughout their entire length are the non-self-purifying caves. The caves which were only affected by external environment at the entrance are the self-purifying caves.

AB  - Trace elements contamination in sediment is regarded as the global crisis with a large share in developing countries like China. Water and sediment samples were collected during (2016) from Qingshui Stream and analyzed for major physicochemical properties and trace elements by using ICP-MS. Our result of sediments showed that studied trace elements (except Pb, Cd, Co) had a concentration higher than Chinese sediment guideline as well as stream water data for studied trace elements (except Cr, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn) had a higher concentration than the maximum permissible safe limit of WHO. Contamination factor (CF) confirmed a moderate to high contamination in the sediment samples due to As and Tl, respectively. The values of pollution load index (PLI) were found above one (>1), describing the progressive sediment quality decline. Pearson correlation showed that there was a significant positive association between Tl and As (r=0.725, p<0.05) in sediment samples. Results revealed that water-rock interaction, weathering of Tl sulfide mineralization, and hydrogeological conditions were major sources of stream water and sediments contamination in the study area. This experimental study contributes to a better understanding of the geochemistry and prevention of trace element contamination in sediments from Lanmuchang area.

AB  - This paper presents a development of general regression neural network (a form of artificial neural network) models for the prediction of annual quantities of hazardous chemical and healthcare waste at the national level. Hazardous waste is being generated from many different sources and therefore it is not possible to conduct accurate predictions of the total amount of hazardous waste using traditional methodologies. Since they represent about 40% of the total hazardous waste in the European Union, chemical and healthcare waste were specifically selected for this research. Broadly available social, economic, industrial and sustainability indicators were used as input variables and the optimal sets were selected using correlation analysis and sensitivity analysis. The obtained values of coefficients of determination for the final models were 0.999 for the prediction of chemical hazardous waste and 0.975 for the prediction of healthcare and biological hazardous waste. The predicting capabilities of the models for both types of waste are high, since there were no predictions with errors greater than 25%. Also, results of this research demonstrate that the human development index can replace gross domestic product and in this context even represent a better indicator of socio-economic conditions at the national level.

AB  - Young leaves are conventionally used in the analysis to study the nutrient status of evergreen plants and their responses to environmental changes, but the role of old leaves remains poorly understood. We selected two stand types in 31-year-old Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations with similar soil conditions but different stand densities, to test the hypothesis that nitrogen (N) concentration of old leaves and twigs is more sensitive to stand density than that of young ones. Leaves and twigs were sampled and sorted into young (one-year-old) and old (two- and three-year-old) groups. Significant differences in N concentration and carbon: nitrogen ratio between the low-density stand and high-density stand were only found in the old leaves and twigs but not in the young ones. Although the N resorption efficiency did not vary significantly with stand density, the annual N resorption rates were increased in old leaves and relatively young twigs at high stand density. These results show the potential use of old tissues in the nutrient analysis in Chinese fir plantations. Testing the generality of these results could improve the use of foliar analysis as an indicator of nutrient status and environmental changes in evergreen tree species.

AB  - The type HdV-368 (van Geel et al., 1981) or the Podospora-type (van Geel et al., 2001) is a common representative of non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) with high palaeoecological potential. Here we present a revision of the type on the basis of a survey of the mycological literature and incubation of related dung fungi. The characteristic truncated base of the type HdV-368 is shared by the ascospores of at least 31 species of the genus Podospora, including one species that probably belongs to the nearly related genus Schizothecium. We arrange these species in morphological spore taxa, which are named after representative species, and provide an identification key to the new types and groups including descriptions of ecology and distribution of each species. The former type of HdV-368 falls into the newly erected Podospora decipiens-type, which covers the spores of the coprophilous species P. decipiens and P. perplexens and partly of P. pleiospora and P. prethopodalis. A short discussion of the spores of coprophilous fungi as palaeoecological indicators for animal diversity, population density, vegetation, climate, local conditions, and transport events is also given. The key's application can provide detailed insights into past environmental and biodiversity changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Glucocorticoids are important mediators of energy utilization for key physiological processes, including immune function. Much work has focused on the effects of energy limitation and stress for key physiological processes such as reproduction and immunity. However, it is unclear how stress alters energy use across different energy states, and the physiological ramifications of such effects are even less clear.
   2. In this study, we altered energy and stress states of an infrequent feeder, the terrestrial gartersnake (Thamnophis elegans), using fasting and repeated restraint stress (chronic stressors) to test how these challenges interacted to affect immune function, energy metabolites and glucocorticoid reactivity (a traditional indicator of stress state) to restraint stress, a standardized, acute stressor. After this acute stressor, the snakes which had received chronic stress had increased glucocorticoid reactivity, and both treatments altered energy metabolite use and storage. Evidence of interaction of food restriction and chronic stress treatments on innate immune function and energy metabolites (triglycerides and glycerol) suggests that stress alters energy use in a manner dependent on the energy state of the animal.
   3. Snakes have a remarkable ability to maintain functionality of key physiological processes under stressful conditions but are still susceptible to multiple simultaneous stressors, a situation increasingly prevalent in our ever-changing environment.

AB  - The ionic composition of urine is a good indicator of patient's general condition and allows for diagnostics of certain medical problems such as e.g., urolithiasis. Due to environmental factors and malnutrition the number of registered urinary tract cases continuously increases. Most of the methods currently used for urine analysis are expensive, quite laborious and require skilled personnel. The present work deals with feasibility study of potentiometric multisensor system of 18 ion-selective and cross-sensitive sensors as an analytical tool for determination of urine ionic composition. In total 136 samples from patients of Urolithiasis Laboratory and healthy people were analyzed by the multisensor system as well as by capillary electrophoresis as a reference method. Various chemometric approaches were implemented to relate the data from electrochemical measurements with the reference data. Logistic regression (LR) was applied for classification of samples into healthy and unhealthy producing reasonable misclassification rates. Projection on Latent Structures (PLS) regression was applied for quantitative analysis of ionic composition from potentiometic data. Mean relative errors of simultaneous prediction of sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulfate, phosphate, urate and creatinine from multisensor system response were in the range 3-13% for independent test sets. This shows a good promise for development of a fast and inexpensive alternative method for urine analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pen-urban vegetation, which delivers a diversity of fundamental services, sustains increasing pressures from human activities. Characterizing the socioeconomic drivers of vegetated landscape pattern changes can inform ecological management. Vegetated landscape pattern changes, (including paddy, dryland, woodland, forest, and perennial plantations) in Tiaoxi watershed (China) between 1985 and 2009, were characterized using a set of landscape metrics. Their relationships with socioeconomic development were quantified by multivariable regression. Results showed that Tiaoxi watershed experienced rapid socioeconomic development based on a set of indicators (demography, economy, and social activities). Vegetated landscapes were less abundant and connected, and became more irregular, fragmented, and diverse at landscape level. At class level, increasing fragmentation and isolation were identified for all vegetated landscape types. Paddy, dryland, and forest decreased in area and aggregation, while woodland and perennial plantations presented opposite trends. Socioeconomic drivers of vegetated landscapes pattern changes differed with metrics and with vegetated landscape types. Generally, population growth, road construction, income increase, and tertiary industry development were the major drivers. The identified socioeconomic drivers differed from those for urban areas in previous related report. The inconsistence could be attributed to the different socioeconomic conditions and their interactions with land use practice between urban and pen-urban areas. This study contributed to the identification of key socioeconomic indicators influencing vegetated landscape pattern changes in pen-urban regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rodents from the late middle Pleistocene hominin-bearing locality of J'bel Irhoud include the following species: Meriones shawii, Gerbillus grandis, Dipodillus campestris, Paraethomys ras, Lemniscomys barbarus, Mus cf spretus, and Eliomys sp. We consider M. shawii, a living species, as identical with the middle Pleistocene Meriones maghrebianus. The mouse differs from the domestic Mus musculus but does hot clearly fit into Mus spretus, either. The rare G. grandis looks identical with the form from the middle Pleistocene of Thomas quarries, which may suggest a rather early age for Irhoud. This is in agreement with the occurrence of Paraethomys, a genus unknown in the upper Pleistocene of Morocco, but the absence of the arvicolid Ellobius suggests that the site is younger than other middle Pleistocene sites, Doukkala II, Sidi Abderrahmane D2, and Irhoud-Derbala-Virage. Paleoecological indicators, such as the taxonomic habitat spectrum, or the relative abundances of Gerbillinae and Murinae, suggest a less xeric environment than in many earlier and later sites. Diversity indices, comparable to those of other middle Pleistocene sites, point to similarly favorable conditions before the major climatic crisis close to the middle/upper Pleistocene boundary that drastically reduced rodent diversity in North Africa.

AB  - 1. In vitro screens are sought as informative, alternatives to the use of animals in vivo and to improve upon the current use of fish liver 9000 g supernatants (S9) in environmental risk assessment.
   2. The rates of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (relative to S9 protein) measured under different conditions of culture of rainbow trout hepatocytes were significantly higher than those detected in S9, in the order of freshly isolated hepatocytes > 10-day spheroid cultures > primary hepatocytes in culture > S9. The percentage of conjugated metabolites was also similar between freshly isolated and spheroid cultured hepatocytes (9.9 and 13.5%).
   3. The rate of oxidation was enhanced (1.7 fold) when S9 was supplemented with cofactors for phase II conjugation but this was only approximately one tenth of the rate in freshly isolated hepatocytes (7.1 pmol/min/mg S9 protein equivalent).
   4. Hepatocytes also hydroxylated ibuprofen, producing two metabolites, in contrast to only one (identified as the 1-hydroxy derivative) using hepatic S9 fractions.
   5. Since the bioaccumulation potential of chemicals is often based on un-supplemented S9 in incubations >= 1 h when activity declines, it is recommended that predictability would be greatly improved through the use of hepatocyte spheroids, due to their maintenance of activity and longevity.

AB  - Age-at-death estimation of an individual skeleton is important to forensic and biological anthropologists for identification and demographic analysis, but it has been shown that the current aging methods are often unreliable because of skeletal variation and taphonomic factors Multifactorial methods have been shown to produce better results when determining age-at-death than single indicator methods However, multifactorial methods are difficult to apply to single or poorly preserved skeletons, and they rarely provide the investigator with information about the reliability of the estimate. The goal of this research is to examine the validity of the Sugeno fuzzy integral as a multifactorial method for modeling age-at-death of an individual skeleton. This approach is novel because it produces an informed decision of age-at-death utilizing multiple age indicators while also taking into consideration the accuracies of the methods and the condition of the bone being examined Additionally, the Sugeno fuzzy integral does not require the use of a population and it qualitatively produces easily interpreted graphical results Examples are presented applying three commonly used aging methods on a known-age skeletal sample from the Terry Anatomical Collection. This method produces results that are more accurate and with smaller intervals than single indicator methods. Am J Phys Anthropol 142:30-41, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss. Inc

AB  - Mate choice studies routinely assume female preferences for indicators of high quality in males but rarely consider developmental causes of within-population variation in mating preferences. By contrast, recent mate choice models assume that costs and benefits of searching or competing for high-quality males depend on females' phenotypic quality. A prediction following from these models is that manipulation of female quality should alter her choosiness or even the direction of her mating preferences. We here provide (to our knowledge) the first example where an experimental manipulation of female quality induced a mating preference for low-quality males. Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) reared in small or large experimental broods became high-or low-quality adults, respectively. Only high-quality females preferred high-quality males' mate-advertising songs, while all low-quality females preferred low-quality males' song. Subsequent breeding trials confirmed this pattern: latency until egg laying was shortest in quality-matched pairs, indicating that quality-matched birds were accepted faster as partners. Females produced larger eggs when mated with high-quality males, regardless of their own quality, indicating consensus regarding male quality despite the expression of different choices. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the development of mating preferences to understand their within-population variation and environmentally induced change.

AB  - The sediment-water interface is usually marked by an increase in acoustic impedance and is therefore displayed in a seismic section as a positive polarity reflection. Here, we use the term "seabed phase reversal" to describe areas of seafloor which are instead expressed as a negative polarity reflection in seismic data. We describe in detail a number of examples of seafloor phase reversals and use a simple one-dimensional geophysical model to test the hypothesis that they are the result of the presence of gas within the seafloor sediment. Our examples are all related to seismically imaged mud volcanoes located within the South Caspian Sea. Sections of phase-reversed seafloor at the summit area of these volcanoes have been mapped to reveal the existence of seafloor mud pools (salses) and recently erupted mud flows which show a strong similarity to smaller-scale features at onshore volcanoes in Azerbaijan. Synthetic geophysical modelling indicates that under the physical conditions likely to occur when the seabed sediment is gas-bearing, the seafloor will be expressed as a strong negative polarity reflection. Unlike other indicators of seafloor gas, such as pockmarks, which merely record the transient expulsion of fluids from sedimentary basins, seafloor phase reversals indicate the presence of gas in marine sediment at the time of survey acquisition. They therefore are of significance to engineering and site survey operations as well as the identification of biological communities and gas flux calculations.

AB  - Current research on stable carbon isotopes of the Chinese loess is reviewed. The stable carbon isotopic composition of soil organic matter (SOM) (delta C-13(org)) of paleosols formed during interglacials is more positive than that within loess accumulated during glacials. Spatially, it becomes progressively more negative from the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to the western. However, stable carbon isotopic composition of pedogenic carbonates (delta C-13(carb)) from the same sequence produces an opposing trend, both temporally and spatially, and variation differs from expectations under conditions of equilibrium. This indicates that delta C-13(carb) in the Chinese loess cannot be used to reconstruct the relative proportion of C-3/C-4 plants in past ecological communities. Furthermore, use of delta C-13(carb) to reconstruct the expansion of C-4 plants in older Tertiary red clay deposits is considered unreliable. We believe delta C-13(carb) may act as an indirect indicator of vegetation density, following on changes in moisture supply controlled by the intensity of the Asian Summer Monsoon, but conclude that full understanding of the paleoclimatic significance of delta C-13(carb) in the Chinese loess and underlying Tertiary red clay requires better understanding of modern isotopic processes.

AB  - [ 1] This paper discusses the quality and the accuracy of the Joint Research Center (JRC) fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) products generated from an analysis of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data. The FAPAR value acts as an indicator of the presence and state of the vegetation and it can be estimated from remote sensing measurements using a physically based approach. The quality of the SeaWiFS FAPAR products assessed in this paper capitalizes on the availability of a 6-year FAPAR time series over the full globe. This evaluation exercise is performed in two phases involving, first, an analysis of the verisimilitude of the FAPAR products under documented environmental conditions and, second, a direct comparison of the FAPAR values with ground-based estimations where and when the latter are available. This second phase is conducted following a careful analysis of problems arising for performing such a comparison. This results in the grouping of available field information into broad categories representing different radiative transfer regimes. This strategy greatly helps the interpretation of the results since it recognizes the various levels of difficulty and sources of uncertainty associated with the radiative sampling of different types of vegetation canopies.

AB  - Monitoring of transgenic plants in the field is important, but risk assessment has entailed laborious use of invisible marker genes. Here, we assessed three easily visible marker transgenes - green fluorescent protein (GFP), R, and Nicotiana tabacum homeobox (NTH) 15 genes - for their potential use as marker genes for monitoring genetically modified plants. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants for each of these genes were visibly distinguished from wild-type plants. We determined the germination rate, 3-week fresh weight, time to first flowering, and seed weight of the transgenic plants to evaluate whether the expression of these marker genes affected the growth of the host. Introduction of GFP gene had no effect on the evaluated parameters, and we then used the GFP gene as a marker to assess the out-crossing frequency between transgenic and two Arabidopsis species. Our results showed that the hybridization frequency between transgenic plants and Arabidopsis thaliana was 0.24%, and between transformants and Arabidopsis lyrata it was 2.6% under experimental condition. Out-crossing frequency was decreased by extending the distance between two kinds of plants. Thus, the GFP gene is a useful marker for assessing the whereabouts of transgenes/transformants in the field. We also demonstrated that the GFP gene is possibly applicable as a selection marker in the process of generation of transgenic plants.

AB  - Northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) frequently use agricultural field edges in northeast Arkansas, USA, and may be at risk of exposure to cholinesterase (ChE)-inhibiting pesticides. We monitored northern cardinal exposure to ChE-inhibiting pesticides by comparing plasma total ChE (TChE) activity to reference-derived benchmarks and TChE reactivations. Total ChE and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured for 128 plasma samples from 104 northern cardinals from nine study sites. Of birds sampled from sites treated with ChE-inhibiting pesticides, 4.3% of the samples had TChE activities below the diagnostic threshold (2 standard deviations [SD] below the reference mean) and 8.7% of the samples had TChE reactivations. No difference was found in TChE (p = 0.553) and AChE (p = 0.288) activity between treated and reference sites; however, activity varied among treated sites (p = 0.003). These data do not suggest uniform exposure to individuals, but rather exposure was variable and likely influenced by mitigating factors at individual and site scales. Furthermore, monitoring of TChE reactivation appeared to be a more sensitive indicator of exposure than the diagnostic threshold. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was greater at agricultural sites than reference sites (p = 0.016). supporting the hypothesis that FA may be useful for assessing a combination of habitat- and contaminant-related environmental stress.

AB  - Invertebrates show considerable potential as sentinel organisms for the monitoring of the health status of aquatic systems. They are generally small, abundant, relatively sessile, and may readily bioaccumulate toxins. Cascade-like stress responses can occur following acute or chronic exposures to contaminated environments and as such, the overall health status of individuals within those environments, both in terms of histopathological lesions and the presence of infecting organisms, may ultimately reflect the general health status of these sites. The current study provides baseline multi-organ histopathological data for two common crustacean species, the shore crab (Carcinus maenas) and the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) collected from six UK estuarine sites. Changes in the metabolic condition of crustaceans from these sites (measured in terms of connective tissue storage cell status) were interpreted in relation to other health measures (including parasite load and the presence of microbial pathogens). The relative ease at which a holistic assessment of health can be made using histopathology and the suitability of these species as environmental sentinels provide support for the inclusion of crustaceans as indicators of aquatic environmental health. Studies linking disease status to burdens of industrial contamination in these environments are now required. Crown copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides (RH-3), which has been recently reported to elicit dose-dependent pro- and antioxidant properties in vitro, induced apoptosis in murine thymocytes. In a concentration-dependent manner, RH-3 induced apoptosis in thymocytes in ex vivo conditions. The maximum effect was observed with 100 mug/mL of RH-3. Beyond this dose, the induction of apoptosis was inhibited, as seen on the ladder formation. However, apoptotic body formation, another indicator of apoptosis, was not manifested when various doses of RH-3 (20-200 mug/mL) were administered. RH-3 (> 100 mug/ml,) compacted chromatin in the form of densely stained masses, and subsequent treatment with proteinase-K loosened them and developed a halo around each mass. RH-3 treatment of cells that had already undergone apoptosis induced chromatin compaction, which made the ladder invisible. During in vivo experiments in mice, the radioprotective dose of RH-3 (30 mg/kg b.w.) induced significant DNA fragmentation in thymocytes studied spectrofluorimetrically RH-3 treatment before irradiation in vivo enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis. These results were confirmed by hypodiploid population studied flow-cytometrically and also by ladder formation. RH-3 treatment was prooxidative in nature because it depleted thiols and enhanced lipids peroxidation after 8 hours of treatment. The paradox between the prooxidant and the antioxidant effects of RH-3 in the context of its overall radioprotective efficacy has been explained.

During acclimatisation the plants were monitored for the variation of glutathione pools, glutathione reductase activity and chlorophyll fluorescence to identify any of these parameters as a specific indicator of autotrophic behaviour and to assess the effect of high [CO2] in preventing photoinhibition and oxidative stress symptoms due to high irradiance. Grapevine under high light and chestnut under high light and high [CO2] displayed a faster growth and in new leaves GSH approached the values measured in normal field leaves. Concerning chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, the quantum yield of electron transport in PSII given by Phi(e) allowed to identify photoinhibition symptoms in chestnut under high light, and the alleviation of these symptoms by increasing [CO2]. In grapevine a net benefit from high [CO2] was reflected in Phi(e) values very close to in vivo leaves. The results suggest that GSH and Phi(e) are reliable indicators of autotrophic functioning. discriminating between the environmental conditions that accelerate the acquisition of full autotrophy.

AB  - A simple respirometric method was developed and applied for the measurement of biomass activity in bench-scale drinking water biofilters. The results obtained with the new method, i.e. biomass respiration potential (BRP), indicated a high sensitivity allowing the quantification of the activity of low amounts of biomass. The analysis of duplicate samples showed a reasonable reproducibility, i.e. average coefficient of variation of 14% (n = 19). The calculation of the ratio between biomass activity and the amount of viable biomass (phospholipid) at different filter depths indicated a substantial increase of this ratio with filter depth. This indicated an increased biomass activity per unit amount of viable biomass deeper in the biofilters, where biofilm thickness is low. The comparison of the filter profiles of biomass activity and dissolved biodegradable organic matter (BOM), expressed as theoretical oxygen demand, showed a high correlation between these profiles. Consequently, BRP results appear to be good indicators of the BOM removal capacity of the filter biomass. Therefore, BRP results can potentially be used in certain cases instead of BOM measurements for the assessment of the BOM removal capacity of drinking water biofilters, operated under different conditions. This is important because of the relative complexity of the measurements of BOM surrogates, e.g. assimilable organic carbon and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon, and BOM components.

AB  - Models of sexual selection usually assume that variation in the expression of sexual ornaments is determined largely by genetic, rather than environmental, factors(1). However, empirical support for this assumption conies from studies of species with little parental care(1,2), in which the influence of environmental factors may be limited(3,4), and from studies of just two species(5,6) with parental care, in both of which heritability estimates vary hugely between years or populations(7,8). In the remaining studies of species with parental care, it is not known whether resemblance in sexual ornamentation between relatives was due to shared genes or shared patterns of care(3,4,9-15). Here we use cross-fostering experiments in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, to examine the relative roles of these effects. We demonstrate that, although sons resemble their fathers with respect to sexual ornamentation, this resemblance is mainly due to post-hatching environmental effects rather than shared genes. We also show that sons hatching early in the year have the largest ornaments. These results support models that emphasize the importance of environmental sources of variation(16-18), such as direct paternal effects(4,19,20), on the expression of sexual ornaments, and agree with the general observation that sexually selected traits tend to be condition dependent(1). We urge the incorporation of gene-environment interactions into future models of sexual selection.

AB  - Event DP-circle divide 23211-2 (hereafter referred to as DP23211) maize expresses the DvSSJ1 double-stranded RNA (DvSSJ1 dsRNA) and the IPD072Aa protein, encoded by the ipd072Aa gene. DvSSJ1 dsRNA and the IPD072Aa protein each provide control of corn rootworms (Diabrotica spp.) when expressed in plants. As part of the environmental risk assessment (ERA), the potential hazard to non-target organisms (NTOs) exposed to the DvSSJ1 dsRNA and the IPD072Aa protein expressed in DP23211 maize was assessed. Worst-case estimated environmental concentrations (EECs) for different NTO functional groups (pollinators and pollen feeders, soil dwelling detritivores, predators and parasitoids, aquatic detritivores, insectivorous birds, and wild mammals) were calculated using worst-case assumptions. Several factors that reduce exposure to NTOs under more realistic environmental conditions were applied, when needed to provide more environmentally relevant EECs. Laboratory bioassays were conducted to assess the activity of DvSSJ1 dsRNA or the IPD072Aa protein against selected surrogate species, and margins of exposure (MOEs) were calculated by comparing the Tier I hazard study results to worst-case or refined EECs. Based on specificity and MOE values, DvSSJ1 dsRNA and the IPD072Aa protein expressed in DP23211 maize are not expected to be harmful to NTO populations at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB  - Appropriate management approaches are needed to minimize the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in reclaimed water distribution systems (RWDSs). Six laboratory-scale RWDSs were operated over 3 years receiving influent with or without biologically active carbon (BAC) filtration + chlorination, chloramination, or no disinfectant residual. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was applied toward comprehensive characterization of resistomes, focusing on total ARGs, ARG mobility, and specific ARGs of clinical concern. ARGs such as aadA, bacA, bla(OXA), mphE, msrE, sul1, and sul2 were found to be particularly sensitive to varying RWDS conditions. BAC filtration with chlorination most effectively achieved and maintained the lowest levels of nearly all metagenomically derived antibiotic resistance indicators. However, BAC filtration or addition of residual disinfectants alone tended to increase these indicators. Biofilm and sediment compartments harbored ARGs in disinfected systems, presenting a concern for their release to bulk water. Relative and absolute abundances of most ARGs tended to decrease with water age (up to 5 days), with notable exceptions in BAC-filtered chloraminated and no residual systems. Superchlorination of unfiltered water especially raised concerns in terms of elevation of clinically relevant and mobile ARGs. This study revealed that BAC filtration and disinfection must be carefully coordinated in order to effectively mitigate ARG dissemination via RWDSs.

AB  - Understanding P uptake in soil-plant systems requires suitable P tracers. The stable oxygen isotope ratio in phosphate (expressed as delta O-18(P)) is an alternative to radioactive labelling, but the degree to which plants preserve the delta O-18(P) value of the P source is unclear. We hypothesised that the source signal will be preserved in roots rather than shoots.
   In soil and hydroponic experiments with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), we replaced irrigation water by O-18-labelled water for up to 10 d. We extracted plant inorganic phosphates with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), assessed temporal dynamics of delta O-18(TCA-P) values after changing to O-18-labelled water and combined the results with a mathematical model.
   Within 1 wk, full equilibration of delta O-18(TCA-P) values with the isotope value of the water in the growth medium occurred in shoots but not in roots. Model results further indicated that root delta O-18(TCA-P) values were affected by back transport of phosphate from shoots to roots, with a greater contribution of source P at higher temperatures when back transport was reduced.
   Root delta O-18(TCA-P) partially preserved the source signal, providing an indicator of P uptake sources. This now needs to be tested extensively for different species, soil and climate conditions to enable application in future ecosystem studies.

AB  - The paper concerns evaluation of the exploitation of the world's water resources for irrigating field crops. It was determined that the volume of water used in 2020 in all sectors of the economy in relation to the world's freshwater resources will amount to 31 to 38% of the available resources. It has been found that globally, in the period 1900-2100, the agricultural sector has the highest consumption of fresh water. Therefore, there is a need for rational use of water, especially when irrigating field crops. Hence, the paper describes the methods of evaluating the effectiveness of irrigation. The indicators from the Water use efficiency group, which consider the yield obtained from a given area and the sum of irrigation doses, were considered the most reliable form of evaluation. Determining the indicator should also be accompanied by a presentation of the scope of work related to irrigation, water quality, cultivation techniques, fertilization and environmental conditions of the growing season. The work characterizes the selected pressure irrigation systems, considering their advantages and disadvantages. On this basis, the paper presents the adaptation of the SWOT analysis for two irrigation systems: a reel sprinkler with a water cannon and a drip tape.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has fundamentally changed how people move around and live in a city. It is reported that the virus spreads through transmission via large droplets and/or small aerosols when an infected individual coughs or sneezes or even breathes or talks near an uninfected individual. This study considers the implications of physical distancing requirements for pedestrians using urban sidewalks. Pedestrian physical distancing can be described as a mobility intervention designed to limit virus infection by keeping people, for example, 2 m apart. Physical distancing assumes that the risk of transmission declines with the distance between people, but a more sophisticated approach than the current binary approach which is simply based on a single distance may help health agencies to evaluate and monitor how well physical distancing is being achieved. The study developed pedestrian physical distancing indicators to quantitatively evaluate different levels of physical distancing and proposed levels of pedestrian physical distancing that can be used to select and implement appropriate mobility interventions. This study also developed a mathematical process to estimate the relative risk of viral transmission between pedestrians under different pedestrian walking conditions. Finally, we demonstrated the application of the proposed approach in a simulated virtual walkway environment using PTV Viswalk. We hope the study can help decision-makers in health agencies to select the most appropriate pedestrian mobility interventions for limiting spread of the virus on urban sidewalks.

AB  - Groundwater is the most important natural resource around the world which needs new and advanced technologies for control and monitoring. This investigation was to check the groundwater potential zones by integrated techniques of geoinformatics and geophysical investigation through a vertical electrical sounding in Rawalakot, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. The study area being a sedimentary basin, sandstone is the major rock type with good porosity and permeability. Satellite data were used to generate different thematic maps such as slope percent, lineament density, land use/cover, drainage density, geology, roughness index, curvature, topographic wetness index, and rainfall. Subsequently suitable rank and weightage was assinged for final weight overlay analysis to identify the groundwater potential zones. Final potential map was generated with good, moderate, and poor zones. This analysis revealed that 92.60% of the area is categorized to be having good to moderate groundwater potential. Then, an electrical resistivity survey was done by vertical electrical sounding (VES) using Schlumberger electrode configuration, at 32 locations to check the subsurface condition. The predominant curve types were Q type, A type, H type, and K type. The apparent resistivity was calculated at 20-m, 40-m, and 60-m depths. Dar-Zarrouk parameters were calculated to identify the subsurface aquifers and protective capacity rating. Integrating the outcome of GIS and geophysical studies, the region with good groundwater potential was delineated with more accuracy.

AB  - A lot of national and international effort has been made to promote sustainable agricultural production systems in drylands. However, success has been seriously limited due to lack of thorough characterization of the impact of the diversity of farm household types on productivity, resource-use efficiency and economic and nutritional status. This study applied hierarchical ascendant classification to a random sample of 286 cereal-producing farm households in Morocco and identified distinct household typologies. It also carried out an analysis of trade-offs between economic, nutritional and environmental factors induced by the production decisions of the different farm household typologies. Our analysis identified three dominant farm household typologies in the production system, namely: (i) intensive predominantly-vegetable farming households with high input intensities, (ii) semi-intensive cereal mono-crop farming households with moderate input intensities and (iii) extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households with low input intensities. Extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households exhibited the highest resource-use efficiency and high biodiversity. These benefits, however, came at the expense of a much lower farm income and limited food supplies relative to the other two systems. These results show that, as is the case for many dryland regions, all three farm types showed precarious conditions for one or more of the sustainability-related indicators.

AB  - Hybridization of solar and wind energy to supply an electrical load demand is considered as a realistic approach aiming to take the benefit of these power generation sources and facilitate their integration for a stand-alone and grid-connected application. However, an under-sizing of the hybrid system mays disturbs the operation of all-electric equipment; on the contrary, an over-sizing may turn higher the investment cost of the hybrid system. Therefore an appropriate size of the hybrid renewable plant could help to guarantee the minimal cost of integration with the maximum power reliability. A specific design under TRNSYS and Matlab has been used to assess weather condition of solar irradiation, wind speed, and temperature for the selected referee cities, after, a determined load demand profile of a laboratory prototype is used to describe daily energy consumption. Then a dynamic simulation of energy output performance for different hybrid configuration is analyzed during one year; as a result, only one optimized configuration is chosen for each referee cities with respect of minimal investment cost and maximal power reliability. Finally, a techno-economic investigation of the chosen optimized solution is presented as a result and discussed, as well as an environmental assessment.

AB  - Eight oil samples from Lower Cretaceous Fahliyan reservoirs and 51 core and cutting samples from Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Garau Formation in Abadan Plain, Southern Iran, were analyzed using bulk property and molecular methods in order to identify their geochemical characteristics such as maturity and source depositional environment, as well as to correlate them to respective source rock(s). Rock-Eval pyrolysis and vitrinite reflectance measurements indicated that the Garau Formation, classified as a good-to-excellent source rock, the kerogen is mainly of Type II and the maturity is in peak oil generation. The crude oils of the Fahliyan reservoir are classified as light oil (API more than 35), non-biodegraded, saturate fraction, slight even/odd predominance, and front-end biased distribution in gas chromatogram. According to molecular and isotopic data, the oils were generated by a marine carbonate source rock which was deposited under the anoxic condition. Furthermore, all the studied samples reveal compositional similarity and hence can be assigned to one oil family, originating from a common source rock. Based on compositional similarities of biomarkers and isotope data in the studied crude oils and source rock, the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Garau Formation can be regarded as the main source rock of the oils.

AB  - Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated functional interactions between autonomic (ANS) and brain (CNS) structures involved in higher brain functions, including attention and conscious processes. These interactions have been described by the Central Autonomic Network (CAN), a concept model based on the brain-heart two-way integrated interaction. Heart rate variability (HRV) measures proved reliable as non-invasive descriptors of the ANS-CNS function setup and are thought to reflect higher brain functions. Autonomic function, ANS-mediated responsiveness and the ANS-CNS interaction qualify as possible independent indicators for clinical functional assessment and prognosis in Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). HRV has proved helpful to investigate residual responsiveness in DoC and predict clinical recovery. Variability due to internal (e.g., homeostatic and circadian processes) and environmental factors remains a key independent variable and systematic research with this regard is warranted. The interest in bidirectional ANS-CNS interactions in a variety of physiopathological conditions is growing, however, these interactions have not been extensively investigated in DoC. In this brief review we illustrate the potentiality of brainheart investigation by means of HRV analysis in assessing patients with DoC. The authors' opinion is that this easy, inexpensive and non-invasive approach may provide useful information in the clinical assessment of this challenging patient population.

AB  - Economic density refers to the degree of labor, population, and tangible capital that concentrate in a physical space. It represents the efficiency of economic activities and intensity of land use in an area. This article presents an in-depth analysis spatial disparity of economic densities in Yellow River Basin in China by using 2000 and 2014 country level data. A composite index of economic density that integrates a suite of population, land, and production indicators through a grey-relation entropy model was applied for the spatial analysis in economic densities. The overall economic density levels in Henan Province and Shandong Province were higher than those of other provinces. Other major spatial agglomerations of counties with high economic density were in central parts of Inner Mongolia and Henan Province, the south of Shanxi Province, and the middle regions of Shaanxi Province. Finally, the indicators that might have influenced the level of economic density and the formation spatial economic disparity within Yellow River Basin were identified as the basic environmental conditions, transportation infrastructure, social and economic infrastructure, level and structure of industrialization level, and strategic policies for regional economic development. The results show that there is indeed spatial economic disparity in the studied region and that it may have been mainly affected by the geographically uneven distribution of per capita income and per capita land use intensity.

AB  - Enterococci are used to monitor recreational water quality worldwide, so understanding their fate and transport in the environment is essential to the protection of human health. As such, researchers have documented enterococci inactivation under various exposure conditions and in diverse water matrices. However, the majority of studies have been performed using lab-cultured bacteria, which are distinct from indigenous, uncultured bacteria found in the environment. Here we investigate the photoinactivation of indigenous, uncultured enterococci from a range of sources, including wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), marine beaches, urban streams, and a wastewater-influenced pond. We concentrated indigenous enterococci from their sources using filtration and centrifugation, placed them in a clear buffer solution, and then exposed them to simulated sunlight to measure their photoinactivation rates. First order decay rate constants (k) of indigenous, uncultured enterococci spanned an order of magnitude, from 0.3 to 2.3 m(2) kJ(UVB)(-1). k values of indigenous enterococci from WWTPs tended to be larger than those from surface waters. The k value of lab-cultured Enterococcus faecalis was larger than those of indigenous, uncultured enterococci from most sources. Negative associations between the fraction of pigmented enterococci and sunlight susceptibility were observed. This work suggests that caution should be taken when extending results on bacterial photoinactivation obtained using lab-cultured bacteria to environmental bacteria, and that enterococci pigmentation may be a useful metric for estimating photoinactivation rate constants.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are widely used as bio-indicators in streams and rivers, and it is usually assumed that their community composition is primarily controlled by local environmental conditions. We examined the distribution of macroinvertebrates within the Guadalupe River basin (3256 km(2)) in Central Texas across physiographic gradients. Spatial analysis with variables that considers flow direction, connectivity and distances between sites (asymmetric eigenvector maps, AEM) detected distinctive communities in the lower reaches of the mainstem, in spring-influenced reaches, and in a tributary with intermittent reaches. Variation partitioning with redundancy analysis showed that large-scale factors, i.e. riverine network patterns (large-scale AEM variables), climatic variation and ecoregion explained a significant proportion (28%) of the variation in community composition within a river basin. The riverine network patterns were the most important factor, explaining 12% alone. Local environmental factors were significant, but completely confounded within these spatial patterns. We propose that there are distinctive macroinvertebrate communities depending on the location in the river network and this may apply to other (subtropical) rivers, which should be tested by future studies. We recommend spatial analysis that considers distances and connectivity within a river network as a powerful tool to recognize multiscale riverine network patterns, which can help to identify priority areas for conservation and to develop sound monitoring programs.

AB  - BACKGROUNDNeonicotinoid insecticides have been identified as an important factor contributing to bee diversity declines. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on Apis mellifera and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (A. mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) following oral exposure in the laboratory.
   RESULTSWe developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed-coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non-lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective LD10 of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in A. mellifera (4 and 24h) and B. terrestris (4h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96h) in O. bicornis. O. bicornis was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin.
   CONCLUSIONOur results underscore the importance to test pesticide combinations likely to occur in agricultural environments, and to include several bee species in environmental risk assessment schemes. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Drought potentially affects carbon balance and growth of trees, but little is known to what extent soil plays a role in the trade-off between carbon gain and growth investment. In the present study, we analyzed leaf non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) as an indicator of the balance of photosynthetic carbon gain and carbon use, as well as growth of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) saplings, which were grown on two different soil types (calcareous and acidic) in model ecosystems and subjected to a severe summer drought. Our results showed that drought led in general to increased total NSC concentrations and to decreased growth rate, and drought reduced shoot and stem growth of plants in acidic soil rather than in calcareous soil. This result indicated that soil type modulated the carbon trade-off between net leaf carbon gain and carbon investment to growth. In drought-stressed trees, leaf starch concentration and growth correlated negatively whereas soluble sugar: starch ratio and growth correlated positively, which may contribute to a better understanding of growth regulation under drought conditions. Our results emphasize the role of soil in determining the trade-off between the balance of carbon gain and carbon use on the leaf level and growth under stress (e.g. drought).

AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important indicator of atmospheric pollution that is mainly derived from combustion processes. The gas is often present at undesirable levels in both open and closed environments worldwide, requiring monitoring under a variety of different conditions. This work describes the development of a sensitive, selective, and inexpensive method for the determination of NO2 in gaseous samples. The method is based on the processing of digital images of the product of the Griess-Saltzman (GS) colorimetric reaction. NO2 was collected and pre-concentrated using C-18 cartridges impregnated with triethanolamine, followed by elution with 5% methanol solution. The reaction for formation of the colored product only required 300 mu L volumes of sample containing reagent, minimizing the generation of chemical wastes. Calibrations using standard atmospheres showed that it was possible to measure NO2 in a concentration range from 5.1 to 100.0 ppb (9.4-188.0 mu g m(-3)), using a sampling flow rate of 0.50 L min(-1) and a collection time of 60 min. The limit of detection achieved with a solution volume of 300 mu L. was 5.0 ppb (9.6 mu g m(-3)), with a relative error of 2% and a coefficient of variation of 1.6%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural organic matter (NOM) is the major precursor to the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. Specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) is a widely used surrogate parameter to characterize NOM and predict its DBP formation potential. The objective of this study was to determine the relationships between SUVA and different classes of DBPs formed by NOM fractions from different sources. Three natural waters with a wide SUVA range were fractionated into differing hydrophobicity and molecular weight groups using XAD-4 and XAD-8 resins and ultrafiltration membranes. Each NOM fraction was treated with chlorine and monochloramine under controlled laboratory conditions. Different classes of DBPs showed different relationships with SUVA. SUVA correlated strongly with trihaloacetic acids (THAAs) and unknown total organic halogen (UTOX) yields whereas weak correlations were observed between SUVA and trihalomethane (THM) and dihaloacetic acid (DHAA) yields during chlorination. These results reinforce the hypothesis that DHAAs and THAAs form through different precursors and reaction pathways. Strong correlation between SUVA and UTOX was also observed during chloramination. However, no significant relationship was observed between SUVA and chloramination THMs and DHAAs. Overall, SUVA is a good indicator for the formation of unknown DBPs. This indicates that UV absorbing compounds and aromatic carbon within NOM are the primary sources of precursors for unknown DBPs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized (methyl)lanthionine containing peptides which can efficiently inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. As lantibiotics kill bacteria efficiently and resistance to them is difficult to be obtained, they have the potential to be used in many applications, e.g., in pharmaceutical industry or food industry. Nisin can inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria by binding to lipid II and by making pores in their membrane. The C-terminal part of nisin is known to play an important role during translocation over the membrane and forming pore complexes. However, as the thickness of bacterial membranes varies between different species and environmental conditions, this property could have an influence on the pore forming activity of nisin. To investigate this, the so-called "hinge region" of nisin (residues NMK) was engineered to vary from one to six amino acid residues and specific activity against different indicators was compared. Antimicrobial activity in liquid culture assays showed that wild type nisin is most active, while truncation of the hinge region dramatically reduced the activity of the peptide. However, one or two amino acids extensions showed only slightly reduced activity against most indicator strains. Notably, some variants (+2, +1, -1, -2) exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than nisin in agar well diffusion assays against Lactococcus lactis MG 1363, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis VE14089, Bacillus sporothermodurans IC4 and Bacillus cereus 4153 at certain temperatures.

AB  - The inclusion of ecotoxicity impacts of pesticides in environmental assessments of biobased products has long been hampered by methodological challenges. We expanded the pesticide database and the regional coverage of the pesticide emission model PestLCI v.2.0, combined it with the impact assessment model USEtox, and assessed potential freshwater ecotoxicity impacts (PFEIs) of pesticide use in selected biofuel feedstock production cases, namely: maize (Iowa, US, two cases), rapeseed (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany), Salix (South Central Sweden), soybean (Mato Grosso, Brazil, two cases), sugar cane (Sao Paulo, Brazil), and wheat (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany). We found that PFEIs caused by pesticide use in feedstock production varied greatly, up to 3 orders of magnitude. Salix has the lowest PFEI per unit of energy output and per unit of cultivated area. Impacts per biofuel unit were 30, 750, and 1000 times greater, respectively, for the sugar cane, wheat and rapeseed cases than for Salix. For maize genetically engineered (GE) to resist glyphosate herbicides and to produce its own insecticidal toxin, maize GE to resist glyphosate, soybeans GE to resist glyphosate and conventional soybeans, the impacts were 110, 270, 305, and 310 times greater than for Salix, respectively. The significance of field and site-specific conditions are discussed, as well as options for reducing negative impacts in biofuel feedstock production.

AB  - The present study involved the assessment of potential generation of acid drainage from a coal mining area in India. Laboratory-based static and kinetic tests on overburden samples were conducted. Results of the static tests using acid base accounting indicate that all samples may be acid generators, and their generation capacity varied between likely, possible and low. To verify the acid generation potentiality of those samples showing a high acid drainage production in the static test, the kinetic test, using humidity cell, was conducted for a period of 15 weeks. The samples were leached with simulated rain water to mimic the chemical weathering under controlled laboratory conditions and imitate actual mine site leaching. Data obtained from chemical analysis of collected leachate were used to estimate production and reaction rates of acid generation and neutralizing capacity. Based on the kinetic test, it can be concluded that presently the neutralizing capacity of the samples is better than the oxidation capacity (acid generation). But due to the high weathering rate of carbonates, as reflected by the simulated leaching test, the neutralizing materials (carbonates) will eventually be exhausted earlier (since they showed dissolution rate) than the acid generation species (sulfates). Thus, acid drainage production is predicted from that point of time, when the neutralizing capacity has been exhausted for these mine sites.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify a signal that could be used as an androgen exposure indicator in the European bullhead (Cottus sp.). For this purpose, the ultra-structure of the kidney was characterized to identify normal structure of this organ, and histological changes previously described in the kidney of breeding male bullheads were quantified using the kidney epithelium height (KEH) assay previously developed and validated for the stickleback. In the next step, the effect of trenbolone acetate (TbA), a model androgen, was assessed to identify potential androgenic regulation of bullhead kidney hypertrophy. Measurement of KEH performed on adult non-breeding male and female bullheads exposed for 14 and 21 days to 0, 1.26 and 6.50 mu g/L showed that kidney hypertrophy is induced in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the hypothesis that the European bullhead possesses a potential biomarker of androgen exposure. Combined with the wide distribution of the European bullhead in European countries and the potential of this fish species for environmental toxicology studies in field and laboratory conditions, the hypothesis of a potential biomarker of androgen exposure offers interesting perspectives for the use of the bullhead as a relevant sentinel fish species in monitoring studies. Inducibility was observed with high exposure concentrations of TbA. Further studies are needed to identify molecular signals that could be more sensitive than KEH.

Lethaia, Vol. 45, pp. 615623. The estuarine ostracod Velatomorpha altilis was analysed for size and shape changes over a 23 million-year interval within a portion of the Joggins Fossil Cliffs World Heritage Site. This represents one of a very few number of studies focused on evolutionary trends within marginal environments and contributes to a growing body of research that attempts to link evolutionary patterns with processes. We measured nearly 400 ostracod specimens and used a quantitative model-based test to assess mode of evolution. Samples of ostracods were also analysed for their stable oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions in an attempt to supplement paleoenvironmental interpretations. Stasis was the strongly supported model for mode of evolution in both size and shape metrics, lending support to previous hypotheses that organisms from fluctuating, and therefore stressed, environments, should exhibit stasis because they are genetically well adapted to environmental change over geological time-scales. Stable isotopic compositions indicate samples were diagenetically altered and thus do not preserve a primary signature of paleoenvironmental conditions. Future work should look to other marginal organisms to test whether stasis is indeed a trend in these types of environments. ?Carboniferous, estuarine ostracod, environment, evolutionary mode.

AB  - Interest in the potential effects of global climatechange on forest ecosystems is increasing, but little is known about their effects on canopy communities, even though their reliance on atmospheric moisture and nutrients suggest that they are sensitive to current predictions of climatic change. We conducted a field experiment to assess the potential impacts of predicted climatechange on the growth and health of four common non-vascularepiphytes at three elevations in a subtropical montane moist evergreen broad-leaved forest in southwest China. Even slight changes in climate resulted in remarkably reduced rates of growth and detrimental effects on the health of the transplanted epiphyte species over 2 years. Non-vascularepiphytes in this forest type respond much more rapidly to changes in water availability than terrestrial trees. The non-vascular lichen,Nephromopsis pallescens, is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature, and could be adopted as aclimatechange indicator. Non-vascularepiphyte species may be negatively affected or even severely damaged in the future in subtropical montane forests, as climate conditions are predicted to be warmer and drier. This experiment confirms previous model projections and implies that conservation efforts to maintain the stability and resiliency of montane forest ecosystem to climatechange should include epiphyte communities.

AB  - Genetic markers from Bacteroides and other faecal bacteria are being tested for inclusion in regulations to quantify aquatic faecal contamination and estimate public health risk. For the method to be used quantitatively across environments, persistence and decay of markers must be understood. We measured concentrations of contaminant molecular markers targeting Enterococcus and Bacteroides spp. in marine and freshwater microcosms spiked with human sewage and exposed to either sunlight or dark treatments. We used Bayesian statistics with a delayed Chick-Watson model to estimate kinetic parameters for target decay. DNA-and RNA-based targets decayed at approximately the same rate. Molecular markers persisted (could be detected) longer in marine water. Sunlight increased the decay rates of cultured indicators more than those of molecular markers; sunlight also limited persistence of molecular markers. Within each treatment, Bacteroides markers had similar decay profiles, but some Bacteroides markers significantly differed in decay rates. The role of extracellular DNA in persistence appeared unimportant in the microcosms. Because conditions were controlled, microcosms allowed the effects of specific environmental variables on marker persistence and decay to be measured. While marker decay profiles in more complex environments would be expected to vary from those observed here, the differences we measured suggest that water matrix is an important factor affecting quantitative source tracking and microbial risk assessment applications.

AB  - The US EPA is currently investigating the use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis techniques to estimate densities of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in recreational waters. Present water quality guidelines, based on culturable FIB, prevent same day water quality determination, whereas results from qPCR-based approaches are available within several hours. Epidemiological studies at Publicly-Owned Treatment Works (POTW)-impacted freshwater beaches have also indicated correlations between qPCR determined Enterococcus densities and swimming-related illness rates. Similar qPCR assays are now available for several other accepted or emerging FIB groups. This study provides an initial assessment of qPCR estimated Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, E. coli and Clostridium spp. densities in marine water and sand samples collected over one summer from two POTW-impacted recreational beaches. Relative target sequence densities of these organisms in the samples did not correspond with their relative estimated cell densities. These observations were attributable to differences in target sequences recovered from the calibrator cells of the different types of organisms. Comparative cycle threshold (CT) qPCR analyses of whole cell calibrator samples provide a simple and standardizable approach for estimating both total cell and target sequence densities of different types of FIB in water. Cell density estimates obtained by this approach are subject to uncertainty due to potential variability in absolute numbers of target sequences in the target organisms under different physiological or environmental conditions, but still may allow for informative comparisons with the target sequence estimates.

The selection environment (single bird cages, biosecure facilities, controlled environment) is a very different environment than the commercial production facilities (multiple bird cages, potential disease exposure, variable environment) in which birds are to produce. The testing of individual birds is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. It is essential that the results of any tests be relevant to actual disease or environmental challenge in the commercial environment.
   The use of genetic markers as indicators of immune function is being explored by breeding companies. Use of genetic markers would eliminate many of the limitations in enhancing immune function currently encountered by commercial breeding companies. Information on genetic markers would allow selection to proceed without subjecting breeding stock to disease conditions and could be done before production traits are measured. These markers could be candidate genes with known interaction or involvement with disease pathology or DNA markers that are closely linked to genetic regions that influence the immune response. The current major limitation to this approach is the paucity of mapped chicken immune response genes and the limited number of DNA markers mapped on the chicken genome. These limitations should be eliminated once the chicken genome is sequenced.

AB  - We studied the staining pattern of merocyanine 540 (MC540) by spectral imaging of murine CT26 and human HT29 colon carcinoma cells incubated with the dye MC540. This dye, usually considered a potential membrane probe, localized mainly in the cytoplasmic vesicles of the colon carcinoma cells. However, in cells incubated in an environment similar to that of a tumor (pH 6.7), high fluorescence was detected in the nuclear membrane and nucleoli. Under these acidic conditions, resembling the Krebs effect, a population of CT26 cells displayed fluorescent plasma membranes. In differentiating cells, exhibiting cell cycle arrest at G(1)-phase and an elevated level of alkaline phosphatase, MC540 fluorescence was confined to cytoplasmic vesicles and was not detected in the plasma membrane or in the nucleoli. Cell sorting analysis of both cell types at pH 5.0 revealed higher fluorescence intensity in proliferating cells compared to differentiating cells. The fluorescence intensity of MC540-stained cells reached a maximum at ph 5.0, although the fluorescence of MC540 dye was maximal at pH 7.2. This phenomenon may result from increased binding of MC540 monomers to the cells because disaggregation of the dye with Triton X-100 produced similar results. We conclude that nucleolar localization of MC540 and an elevated fluorescence intensity can be used as indicators for proliferating cells in the characteristically acidic tumor environment.

AB  - Biogeochemical hotspots are defined as areas where biogeochemical processes occur with anomalously high reaction rates relative to their surroundings. Due to their importance in carbon and nutrient cycling, the characterization of hotspots is critical for predicting carbon budgets accurately in the context of climate change. However, biogeochemical hotspots are difficult to identify in the environment, as methods for in situ measurements often directly affect the sensitive redox-chemical conditions. Here, we present imaging results of a geophysical survey using the non-invasive induced polarization (IP) method to identify biogeochemical hotspots of carbon turnover in a minerotrophic wetland. To interpret the field-scale IP signatures, geochemical analyses were performed on freeze-core samples obtained in areas characterized by anomalously high and low IP responses. Our results reveal large variations in the electrical response, with the highest IP phase values (> 18 mrad) corresponding to high concentrations of phosphates (> 4000 mu M), an indicator of carbon turnover. Furthermore, we found a strong relationship between the electrical properties resolved in IP images and the dissolved organic carbon. Moreover, analysis of the freeze core reveals negligible concentrations of iron sulfides. The extensive geochemical and geophysical data presented in our study demonstrate that IP images can track small-scale changes in the biogeochemical activity in peat and can be used to identify hotspots.

AB  - Intensive repeated momentary diary techniques, such as the experience sampling method (ESM), place considerable burden on study participants by repeatedly prompting them to fill in a questionnaire several times throughout the day. The objective of this study was to investigate the level of disturbance reported by participants and predictors thereof using a pooled dataset of seven ESM studies including 1319 healthy participants and individuals with different mental health conditions. All studies used a design of 10 prompts per day over the course of 4 to 6 days. Participants reported no disturbance at 37% of the measurement occasions and the overall level of disturbance was relatively low. Also, clinical samples did not report significantly different levels of disturbance compared to the healthy participants. However, higher levels of disturbance were found for later study days, in the morning, and on weekends. Also, younger participants reported feeling more disturbed by the prompts. In terms of momentary states, higher levels of activity, activity stress, and tiredness were associated with higher disturbance. Also, participants experienced more disturbance when in company compared to when alone, and the level of disturbance increased when in company with less familiar people. Our findings suggest that studies using high-frequency ESM protocols can be used in mental health research, but researchers should be aware of the possible disturbance caused by their research design.

AB  - Developing an individual tree diameter increment (Delta DBH) model is the basis of near-natural management of mixed, uneven-aged oak forests. This analysis used remeasurement data (2009-2014) comprising 6154 observations from 112 permanent plots in central China to develop and compare an indicator variable model (IVM) and a mixed-effect model (MEM) to estimate Delta DBH. First, a basic model was estimated using 12 potential explanatory variables. Geographical regions (GR), competition intensities (CI) and species compositions (SC) were introduced into the basal model as indicator variables or mixed effects, step by step, and then the prediction accuracy of IVM and MEM was compared. The results showed that (1) the independent variables significantly affecting Delta DBH included the reciprocal of DBH, basal area, altitude, and mean annual rainfall; (2) the introducing GR could not improve the accuracy of estimating Delta DBH, but the CI and SC could. (3) Compared with the basic model and IVM, the percentage mean absolute deviation of MEM decreased by 2.07% and 1.11%, while the root mean square error decreased by 0.06 and 0.04, respectively. The MEM including CI and SC as a random effect showed the best predictive performance and can be applied to improve the prediction of individual oak trees Delta DBH.

AB  - Biocomposites are increasingly being applied in the automotive industry. For assembly purpose, drilling process is often performed in these biocomposites parts to produce holes. The machining behavior of biocomposites is affected by the matrix, the reinforcements (nature and size), by the cutting conditions and the mechanical properties of biocomposites. Some of the newly developed biocomposites are made of a polypropylene/polyolefin blend matrix, which has low thermal conductivity and low softening temperature. Therefore, the selection of cutting parameters should be done with care to avoid thermal-induced damages occurred during drilling biocomposites. Also, due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic properties of biocomposites, it is essential to develop models for predicting the effects of these factors on the machining process performance indicators. In this research work, a full factorial design is used to investigate the effects of machining parameters (feed rate, drill diameter, spindle speed, and reinforcement type) on machinability indicators during the drilling of the three new biocomposites: Polypropylene/Polyolefin matrix reinforced with biocarbon particles and/or miscanthus fibers. The regression and ANFIS-based models are established for predicting thrust force (F-t) and surface roughness (R-a) based on empirical data. The results obtained show that, for each tested biocomposite, the proposed ANFIS models have better predictive accuracy for thrust force and surface roughness than the regression-based models. Furthermore, the drilling parameters and reinforcements used in these biocomposites considerably affect their machinability.

AB  - Livability is one of the major guiding principles for urban planning and policymaking, of which the definition and evaluation have become the crucial research topic. As the progress in socioeconomic development accelerates, the microscale living conditions require more urgent attention. However, few researchers have addressed the assessment of urban livability at a finer spatial scale such as the community scale. Thus, this article aims to evaluate the urban environmental quality at the community level given the residential community as the basic unit of urban living areas. We select eighteen objective indicators from five dimensions to establish an objective indicator system. Taking the preferences of different age groups into account, a comprehensive evaluation framework for the livability of communities combining both subjective perceptions and objective indicator is constructed. Then, it is applied to evaluate the livability of 1,394 residential communities in Ningbo City. There are three significant results from the study. First, different age groups have diverse preferences of demands to the livability of an urban community. The indicators they valued most concentrated in the following two dimensions: the convenience of transportation and the completeness of supporting facilities. Second, there exists significant heterogeneity in the livability of communities among districts. Third, the livability of communities shows a decreasing spatial pattern from the city center to the surroundings. These empirical results can be advantageous to urban planning departments and other relevant stakeholders.

AB  - Simple energy surveys and audits were performed in 60 processing industries of meat, dairy, horticultural and bread and pastry products, located in the North, Center, and Alentejo regions of Portugal. The number of refrigeration chambers, building infrastructure, and energy consumptions of the equipment used in the manufacturing processes were evaluated. The energy consumption of different manufacturing processes of regional food products were compared. The study aims to present several measures and best practices for the improvement of energy efficiency of the food sector. The implementation of simple and very cost-effective transversal electricity savings measures such as awareness and/or training of operators, proper maintenance, and monitoring tasks, can benefit this sector. The tailored energy efficiency measures by sector are discussed. These energy efficient practice measures can offer savings at several levels, increasing productivity and competitiveness and improving the environmental impact, and thus the global sustainability of the Portuguese food sector. Practical applications The adoption of efficiency measures by SMEs provides them the necessary instruments to become more competitive and dynamic in the market, due to the reduction of the energy costs. This condition allows funds to be redirected to areas such as logistics, ensuring an expansion to international markets. This paper presents several measures of energy efficiency, many of which require small investments. The objective of this study is to provide a reference guide, with the purpose of qualifying SMEs for the adoption of strategies to increase their competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency.

AB  - A massive ecological restoration program has been implemented in northern China with the aim of protecting the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area of eastern China from dust events. However, some current studies have cast doubt on the efficacy of such ecological restoration projects, partly due to the constraint of available water in northern China, leading to poor survival rates of planted trees in semiarid regions (15%). In this study, using a logical framework combining statistical analysis, partial least-squares path model analysis, and a regional climate model (RegCM) simulation with multisource dust indicators, we found that there was a reduction of dust in northern China that was synchronous with the increase in vegetation growth after ecological restoration. In contrast to previous reports of a decrease in wind speed due to ecological restoration, this study found that the increase in vegetation had an insignificant impact on local wind speed (p = 0.30). Instead, ecological restoration mainly reduced the sand emission in steppe area by improving the soil conditions of the underlying surface, and hence contributed 15% of the reduction of dust events in the Beijing- Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area through dust transmission (p = 0.002). The effect of ecological restoration in the northern steppe on dust reduction over the northeastern metropolitan area of China should not be overstated.

AB  - We measured black carbon (BC) with a seven-wavelength aethalometer (AE-31) at the Nam Co Lake (NCL), the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from May 2015 to April 2016. The daily average concentration of BC was 145 +/- 85 ng m(-3), increasing by 50% since 2006. The seasonal variation of BC shows higher concentrations in spring and summer and lower concentrations in autumn and winter, dominated by the adjacent sources and meteorological conditions. The diurnal variation of BC showed that its concentrations peaked at 9:00-16:00 (UTC + 8), significantly related to local human activities (e.g., animal-manure burning and nearby traffic due to the tourism industry). The concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis showed that the long-distance transport of BC from South Asia could also be a potential contributor to BC at the NCL, as well as the biomass burning by the surrounding residents. The analyses of the absorption coefficient and absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent show the consistency of sourcing the BC at the NCL. We suggest here that urgent measures should be taken to protect the atmospheric environment at the NCL, considering the fast-increasing concentrations of BC as an indicator of fuel combustion.

AB  - Aggression in male mice often leads to injury and death, making social housing difficult. We tested whether (1) small group size, (2) early age of allocation to a group decreases aggression and 3) manipulation increases aggression in male mice. A 14wk study was performed to assess the following conditions in male CD-1/ICR mice: group size (1, 2, or 3), age at grouping (5 or 7wks), and manipulation (daily scruffing or minimal weekly handling). Wounds, body weights, food consumption, nest scores, sucrose consumption, fecal corticosterone and blood for hematology were collected. At the end of the study, mice were euthanized and pelted to assess wounding with the pelt aggression lesion scale (PALS). No signs of acute or chronic stress were observed in any of the groups. Trio housed mice showed less bite wounds than pair housed mice. In general, mice in larger groups ate less but weighed more. Individually housed mice, however, had high nest scores, low body weights, and increased sucrose and food consumption. These results suggest that even when nesting material is provided, individual mice may be experiencing thermal stress. Based on this data, CD-1 mice can successfully be housed for up to 14wks and groups of 3 may be the best for reducing even minor levels of aggression (i.e. wounding).

AB  - Drought and soil salinity are the main abiotic stresses in semiarid regions of the world. This study aims to evaluate the effect of water tensions generated by the reduction of soil moisture and salt on the leaf water potential of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp). The experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design, with a 6 x 2 factorial arrangement consisted of six soil water tensions (0.025, 0.265, 0.485, 0.705, 0.925, and 1.145 MPa) and two tension sources (water deficit and salt), with four replications. Two experiments were performed with the same environmental conditions to evaluate the influence of the tensions on vegetative and reproductive stages. Water and osmotic potentials, relative water content, leaf succulence, and shoot biomass yield were evaluated. Soil water tension was not the main factor of changes on water and osmotic potentials of V. unguiculata plants; the water deficit treatments at soil water tensions of up to 1.145 MPa did not reduce the water and osmotic potentials either at the vegetative or flowering phenological stages; high correlations were found between shoot biomass yield and the leaf water potential at seven days after stress. The osmotic potential was the main indicator of stress in plants at the vegetative and flowering stages subjected to water deficit by the presence of salts in the soil solution.

AB  - This work investigates the hydrodynamic response of two small and shallow bays located in the Ebro Delta, in order to solve the problems affecting mussel farms, such as the high temperatures reached in the summer period (>28 degrees C), causing the death of these bivalves, and the limited water renewal that causes anoxia within the bay. Nature Based Solutions are described focusing on two aspects: one, modifying the flow of these drainage channels, increasing the arrival of freshwater to the bays; and two, opening a gap in the sand bars so that there is a flow of sea water in and out through the innermost zone, which is where both bays have greater problems of water renewal. The impact of those solutions simulated with the Regional Oceans Modeling System (ROMS), consist of a set of nested domains that use CMEMS-IBI data for the initial and open boundary conditions (coarser domain). To validate the numerical model, data from in situ campaigns have been used for one full year (2014) for Alfacs Bay, and for the summer period (July-August 2017) for Fangar Bay. In addition, the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is also studied as an indicator to reduce the mortality problems of mussels, but the results obtained do not reduce this variable. What the results do show is a decrease in residence time in both bays for both experiments, with the increase in flow being more viable than the increase in sand bar breakage.

AB  - Batch co-digestion tests of chicken manure (CM) and sheep manure (SM) at different ratio (R-s/c) were conducted under mesophilic condition (35 degrees C). Batch kinetic analysis of bioCH(4) production, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and microbial community were investigated. The well-fitted modified Gompertz model (R-2, 0.98-0.99) resulted that the co-digestion markedly improved the methane production rate and shortened the lag phase time. The highest bioCH(4) yield of 219.67 mL/gVS(add) and maximum production rate of 0.378 mL/gVS(add)/h were obtained at an optimum R-s/c of 0.4. Additionally, a significant variation of DOM was detected at the R-s/c of 0.4 with a consistent degradation of soluble microbial byproduct-like and protein-like organics. The positive synergy effects of co-digestion conspicuously enhanced the bioCH(4) production efficiency. FI370 and NADH were significantly correlated to R-s/c (p < 0.05). Moreover, the correlations among process indicator, EEM-peaks and different environmental parameters were evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis. The high diversity of acetoclastic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the co-digestion improved the stability of process.

AB  - The radiological consequences of a potential atmospheric release of 131I, 137Cs, 133Xe and 90Sr for hypothetical accident appropriate to a 10 MW research reactor were calculated. The Gaussian model CROM (Screening Model for Environmental Assessment) was used to compute the accidental radioactive release under emergency exposure situation and the estimation of yearly average dose by different exposure pathways. The realistic assessment of radiation level due to the abnormal occurrence operation of nuclear installations such as foods consumption, external irradiation, inhalation and ingestion has been examined. In this study, the evaluation of the dose results, to a continuous emissions rate under dry and wet deposition process, was estimated onto six reference groups of public covering the period from the new born infant to more than 17 years old as defined by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. The obtained modeling results were compared to the limits values prescribed by IAEA and Euratom recommendations. The findings indicate that the ground concentrations were found to be significant and mostly sensitive to the emission conditions, when the total deposition exceeds the contamination limits. The short-lived isotopes have much more influence on the concentration on foodstuff. The activity concentration of 131I is significantly higher in animal products and vegetables, while the 137Cs is dominant in fruits vegetables. In contrast, the Noble gas 133Xe is significantly lower.

AB  - Habitat complexity conferred by vegetation characteristics mediates key processes that govern the assemblage of insect communities. Thus, species within the community should only persist if their functional traits are well-matched to the conditions of their environment. Here, we compared ant assemblages between habitats in terms of species richness and functional-trait distribution at the species and the assemblage level. Ants were collected from 36 sites representing different degrees of habitat complexity mediated by standing vegetation. We found fewer ant species in simpler habitats, supporting the "habitat-heterogeneity" hypothesis. We measured key functional traits of ants that reflect their foraging and dispersal strategies, such as body size, femur length, antenna scape length, and head length / width. Interactions of species traits with measured habitat complexity variables were assessed at the species and the assemblage level using a fourth-corner approach. Ant traits were closely related to environmental complexity. In wooded habitats, ants were larger and had broader heads, while ants with longer antenna scapes prevailed in habitats with a dense herb / grass layer. Our study suggests that vegetation structural complexity can act as an environmental filter, driving ant assemblages in terms of both species numbers and functional traits. Our results can be used to predict turnover patterns in ant assemblages due to changes in management practices.

AB  - Very few excavated sequences in southern South America provide an approximation to the environmental evolution covering the segment Late Pleistocene-Holocene. Here we present the taphonomic analysis and paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on the small mammal remains retrieved from the archaeological and paleontological site Gruta del Indio (Mendoza Province, Argentina). Radiocarbon dates situate the small mammal deposits studied within the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Thus, these assemblages provide a record for inferring environmental evolution in the middle basin of Atuel River during the last similar to 31 ky BP. Taphonomic analysis revealed that most of small mammal remains were incorporated by a little destructive nocturnal owl. Recorded species include mainly cricetid and caviomorph rodents and a single marsupial. While Pleistocene assemblages have not exclusive species, the specific richness increases towards the Holocene probably linked with the climatic variability related to ENSO. In overall, the recorded small mammals suggest environmental stability during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene, mostly associated with Monte Desert conditions. Conversely, the pollen sequence studied from Gruta del Indio was interpreted as indicator of a deep environmental change during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, when the Patagonian steppe was replaced by Monte Desert. Potential biases linked with these kinds of proxies are discussed.

AB  - A number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures have been identified in organic horizons of surface-gley tundra soils (Stagnic Cambisols) and the moss Pleurozium schreberi. The total content of polyarenes in soils and P. schreberi exceeds the background values in 3.5-5 times. A tendency of increasing content of polyarenes with the distance from the source to 1 km has been revealed. High coefficients of variation have been found between the contents of PAHs in snow cover, organic soil horizons, and mosses. Light hydrocarbons dominate in the composition of PAHs from the snow and ground covers and mosses. Naphthalene dominates on the surface of mosses in all of the studied plots, which is largely related to its intensive uptake by mosses under pollution conditions. It has been found that when the input of polyarenes onto the surface of tundra phytocenoses increases, the bioaccumulation of PAHs by P. schreberi is intensified, and PAHs begin to penetrate into moss. The increase in the concentration of high-molecularweight polyarenes in the environment plays the key role in the activation of PAH bioaccumulation by moss. It has been shown that P. schreberi can be used as an indicator species for monitoring the contamination of tundra phytocenoses by polyarenes. Both living and dead parts of P. schreberi are suitable for the environmental monitoring of PAH contamination.

AB  - Grazing and over-exploitation can severely degrade soil in native forests. Considering that productivity in ecosystems is related to soil organic matter (SOM) content and quality, the objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the influence of degraded (DEF), partly-degraded (PDF), and undisturbed (UNF) Nothofagus forests on the stocks of carbon (C) in tree biomass and SOM; (2) evaluate fractions of SOM as indicators of sustainable management; and (3) use the Century model to determine the potential gains of soil organic C (SOC). The forests are located in the Andes and Coastal mountains of southern Chile. The SOM was fractionated to separate the light fraction (LF), macroaggregates (>212 mu m), mesoaggregates (212-53 mu m), and microaggregates (<53 mu m). In two measurement periods, the SOC stocks at 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm depths in macroaggregates were on average 100% higher in the Andean UNF, and SOC was over twice as much at 20-40 cm depth in Andean DEF. Century simulations showed that improved silvopastoral management would gradually increase total SOC in degraded soils of both sites, especially the Ultisol with a 15% increase between 2016 and 2216 (vs. 7% in the Andisol). Greater SOC in macroaggregates (p < 0.05) of UNF indicate a condition of higher sustainability and better management over the years.

AB  - Hydrologic connectivity provisions water and nutrient subsidies to floodplain wetlands and may be particularly important in floodplains with seasonal water deficits through its effects on soil moisture. In this study, we measured sapflow in 26 trees of two dominant floodplain forest species (Celtis laevigata and Quercus lyrata) at two hydrologically distinct sites in the lower White River floodplain in Arkansas, USA. Our objective was to investigate how connectivity-driven water table variations affected water use, an indicator of tree function. Meteorological variables (photosynthetically active radiation and vapor pressure deficit) were the dominant controls over water use at both sites; however, water table variations explained some site differences. At the wetter site, highest sapflow rates were during a late-season overbank flooding event, and no flood stress was apparent. At the drier site, sapflow decreased as the water table receded. The late-season flood pulse that resulted in flooding at the wetter site did not affect the water table at the drier site; accordingly, higher water use was not observed at the drier site. The species generally associated with wetter conditions (Q. lyrata) was more positively responsive to the flood pulse. Flood water subsidy lengthened the effective growing season, demonstrating ecological implications of hydrologic connectivity for alleviating water deficits that otherwise reduce function in this humid floodplain wetland.

AB  - In this work, the annual gross electricity demand of Turkey was modeled by multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks as a function population, gross domestic product per capita, inflation percentage, unemployment percentage, average summer temperature and average winter temperature. Among these, the unemployment percentage and the average winter temperature were found to be insignificant to determine the demand for the years between 1975 and 2013. Next, the future values of the statistically significant variables were predicted by time series ANN models, and these were simulated in a multilayer perceptron ANN model to forecast the future annual electricity demand. The results were validated with a very high accuracy for the years that the electricity demand was known (20072013), and they were also superior to the official predictions (done by Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources of Turkey). The model was then used to forecast the annual gross electricity demand for the future years, and it was found that, the demand will be doubled reaching about 460 TW h in the year 2028. Finally, it was concluded that the approach applied in this work can easily be implemented for other countries to make accurate predictions for the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A modelling platform based on regression analysis is developed as a novel approach to structural health monitoring of welded joints of orthotropic bridge steel decks. Monitoring outcomes from the Great Belt Bridge (Denmark) are used to develop regression models following a weighted least squares approach to characterize the normal correlation pattern between environmental conditions (daily-averaged pavement temperatures), operational loads (daily-aggregated heavy traffic counts) and a strain-based performance indicator. The developed models can be used within a structural health monitoring-based asset management framework for performance assessment (i.e. diagnosis of structural performance changes) and performance prediction (i.e. prognosis of structural performance leading to service life estimates). The main novelty of the work presented consists of the development of an algorithm based on statistical control charts related to the prediction bands of the regression models. The algorithm enables the interpretation of new monitoring data and the identification of potentially abnormal behaviours via outlier detection, as part of an envisaged real-time' performance assessment application. The proposed approach to outlier detection through structural health monitoring is finally illustrated considering actual monitoring outcomes from the bridge. This highlights the applicability of the developed modelling platform and contributes to bridging the gap between monitoring data and monitoring-based information that can lead to more effective asset management decisions.

AB  - Effective modelling of the fate and transport of water-borne pathogens is needed to support federally required pollution-reduction plans, for water quality improvement planning, and to protect public health. Lack of understanding of microbial-particle interactions in water bodies has sometimes led to the assumption that bacteria move in surface waters not associated with suspended mineral and organic particles, despite a growing body of evidence suggesting otherwise. Limited information exists regarding the factors driving interactions between micro-organisms and particles in surface waters. This review discusses cellular, particle and environmental factors potentially influencing interactions and in-stream transport. Bacterial attachment in the aquatic environment can be influenced by properties of the cell such as genetic predisposition and physiological state, surface structures such as flagella and fimbriae, the hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge of the cell surface, and the presence of outer-membrane proteins and extracellular polymeric substances. The mechanisms and degree of attachment are also affected by characteristics of mineral and organic particles including the size, surface area, charge and hydrophobicity. Environmental conditions such as the solution chemistry and temperature are also known to play an important role. Just as the size and surface of chemical particles can be highly variable, bacterial attachment mechanisms are also diverse.

AB  - The risk of the desertification of a part of Romania is increasingly evident, constituting a serious problem for the environment and the society. This article attempts to assess and monitor the risk of desertification in Dobrogea using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images acquired in 1987, 1994, 2000, 2007 and 2011. In order to assess the risk of desertification, we used as indicators the Modified Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index 1 (MSAVI1), the Moving Standard Deviation Index (MSDI) and the albedo, indices relating to the vegetation conditions, the landscape pattern and micrometeorology. The decision tree classifier (urn was also used on the basis of pre-established rules, and maps displaying six grades of desertification risk were obtained: non, very low, low, medium, high and severe. Land surface temperature (LST) was also used for the analysis. The results indicate that, according to preestablished rules for the period of 1987-2011, there are two grades of desertification risk that have an ascending trend in Dobrogea, namely very low and medium desertification. An investigation into the causes of the desertification risk revealed that high temperature is the main factor, accompanied by the destruction of forest shelterbelts and of the in-igation system and, to a smaller extent, by the fragmentation of agricultural land and the deforestation in the study area.

AB  - Redox processes are increasingly being recognized as key elements in the regulation of cellular signaling cascades. They are frequently encountered at the frontier between physiological functions and pathological events. The biological relevance of intracellular redox changes depends on the subcellular origin, the spatio-temporal distribution and the redox couple involved. Thus, a key task in the elucidation of the role of redox reactions is the specific and quantitative measurement of redox conditions with high spatio-temporal resolution. Unfortunately, until recently, our ability to perform such measurements was limited by the lack of adequate technology. Over the last 10 years, promising imaging tools have been developed from fluorescent proteins. Genetically encoded reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox indicators (GERRIs) have the potential to allow real-time and pseudo-quantitative monitoring of specific ROS and thiol redox state in subcellular compartments or live organisms. Redox-sensitive yellow fluorescent proteins (rxYFP family), redox-sensitive green fluorescent proteins (roGFP family), HyPer (a probe designed to measure H2O2), circularly permuted YFP and others have been used in several models and sufficient information has been collected to highlight their main characteristics. This review is intended to be a tour guide of the main types of GERRIs, their origins, properties, advantages and pitfalls.

AB  - Peatlands represent one of the most important water resources in the Puna grassland ecoregion, but this fact is not yet widely recognised. Puna peatlands also provide key environmental services such as increasing the regional biodiversity of the Andean Altiplano plateau and contributing to the wellbeing of high-altitude human populations by providing grazing land and cooking fuel. We conducted a study in the Peruvian Puna ecoregion to describe the current condition of peatlands in terms of their vegetation, physical and chemical characteristics and disturbance status. Our results suggest that peat thickness, organic matter and degree of humification are good indicators for identifying peatlands in the Puna ecoregion. In general, the peatland sites that we sampled were dominated by mixtures of cushion and acaulescent rosette forming plants such as Distichia muscoides Nees & Meyen and Plantago tubulosa Decne. These Distichia and Plantago peatland sites were characterised by a mean surface water pH of 6.3, corrected electrical conductivity (K corr.) in the range 300-1814 mu S cm(-1) and presented the following mean exchangeable cation values: Ca2+ 48 mg L-1, Mg2+ 9.6 mg L-1, Na+ 8.2 mg L-1 and K+ 2.1 mg L-1. The most common causes of disturbance we encountered were grazing, peat extraction and roads. Disturbance was most severe in mining sites, where peatlands are especially vulnerable because they are not under legal protection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether immunogold labeling density for basic fibroblastic growth factor in granules is compatible with the activation stage of mast cells.
   STUDY DESIGN: Cytoplasmic features and granules of 46 mast cells were examined at the ultrastructural level. The cells were classified according to their activation stage, namely, whether resting, initially activated, fully degranulated or piecemeal degranulated. Granules were classified as electron lucent, moderate or dense granules. Gold particles per secretory granules in the cells were counted. Recently described quantitative analysis techniques were used for evaluation.
   RESULTS: There is a statistically meaningful relationship between the activation stage of mast cells and their immunogold labeling density. The number of different types of granules encountered in a cell depends on the type of the cell. The distribution of gold particles among the secretory granules depends upon the cell. The type of granule does not have an individual effect on the number of particles, as indicated by an overall statistical analysis of granules, cells and their interaction effects.
   CONCLUSION: A count of gold particles in the cells can be used as a strong biological indicator. Therefore the number of gold particles might be very useful for comparative studies related to the secretion of this growth factor under different conditions.

AB  - We investigate the potential environmental impacts of a large-scale adoption of wind power to meet up to 22% of the world's growing electricity demand. The analysis builds on life cycle assessments of generic onshore and offshore wind farms, meant to represent average conditions for global deployment of wind power. We scale unit-based findings to estimate aggregated emissions of building, operating and decommissioning wind farms toward 2050, taking into account changes in the electricity mix in manufacturing. The energy scenarios investigated are the International Energy Agency's BLUE scenarios. We estimate 1.7-2.6 Gt CO2-eq climate change, 2.1-3.2 Mt N-eq marine eutrophication, 9.2-14 Mt NMVOC photochemical oxidant formation, and 9.5-15 Mt SO2-eq terrestrial acidification impact category indicators due to global wind power in 2007-50. Assuming lifetimes 5 yr longer than reference, the total climate change indicator values are reduced by 8%. In the BLUE Map scenario, construction of new capacity contributes 64%, and repowering of existing capacity 38%, to total cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. The total emissions of wind electricity range between 4% and 14% of the direct emissions of the replaced fossil-fueled power plants. For all impact categories, the indirect emissions of displaced fossil power are larger than the total emissions caused by wind power.

AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the effect of ciprofloxacin antibiotic on the physiological or phenotypic characteristics of food-borne toxigenic Fusarium graminearum and F. avenaceum molds under in vitro conditions.
   In the presence of ciprofloxacin, Fusarium mycelia growth and morphology were altered based on the antibiotic concentration range used. Results showed that ciprofloxacin in concentrations >= 40 mu g/mL induced chlamydospore formation in Fusaria and as such, this antibiotic should be considered as an important abiotic stress factor and growth inhibitor.
   A novel method was investigated to correlate chlamydospore formation with the colour changes observed in FD&C Green Number 3, a common water soluble food dye. The antibiotic-treated F. graminearum and F. avenaceum isolates produced chamydospores, which in turn altered environmental pH with concomitant changes in the colour and intensity of the dye. The colour changes observed as a function of environmental pH were supported by instrumental methods (pH meter and spectroscopy), and a commercial pH indicator (thymol blue) results.
   In conclusion, we propose that FD&C Green Number 3 can be used as an accurate indicator for the rapid assessment of Fusarium molds when grown on ciprofloxacin antibiotic-containing substrate. Special emphasis should be given to an indirect risk assessment of antibiotic effects on toxic molds. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetation phenology is an important indicator of climate change and climate variability and it is strongly connected to biospheric-atmospheric gas exchange. We aimed to evaluate the applicability of phenological information derived from digital imagery for the interpretation of CO2 exchange measurements. For the years 2005-2007 we analyzed seasonal phenological development of 2 temperate mixed forests using tower-based imagery from standard RGB cameras. Phenological information was jointly analyzed with gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from net ecosystem exchange data. Automated image analysis provided reliable information on vegetation developmental stages of beech and ash trees covering all seasons. A phenological index derived from image color values was strongly correlated with GPP, with a significant mean time lag of several days for ash trees and several weeks for beech trees in early summer (May to mid-July). Leaf emergence dates for the dominant tree species partly explained temporal behaviour of spring GPP but were also masked by local meteorological conditions. We conclude that digital cameras at flux measurement sites not only provide an objective measure of the physiological state of a forest canopy at high temporal and spatial resolutions, but also complement CO2 and water exchange measurements, improving our knowledge of ecosystem processes.

AB  - Weed species respond to the cumulative effect of multiple practices employed within weed management systems. However, this response is rarely studied at the system level, and the relationships between weed communities and management systems in crops are not well understood. We used multivariate analyses to assess relationships among tomato management systems and weed species identified through on-farm sampling of 59 fields. Giant foxtail, common lambsquarters, prickly sida, and carpet-weed were common in all systems. Eastern black nightshade was common in the conventional processing and mixed fresh-market systems but largely absent organic system. Barnyardgrass and goosegrass were common in the organic freshmarket system but not in the other systems. Canonical correspondence analysis identified distinct associations between specific species and the management systems. Common purslane was strongly associated with the rain-fed, mixed fresh-market system, and barnyardgass, goosegrass, yellow nutsedge, and green foxtail were associated with the irri-ated, organic fresh-market system. Indicator species analysis in that were significant indicators of the organic, fresh-market identified five species system and one species that was a significant indicator of the rain-fed, mixed freshmarket system. Weed populations persist or increase when a set of species-specific environmental conditions are met. The association of weed species in this study with particular systems supports the hypothesis that weed communities are strongly affected by management systems.

AB  - Models that allow vegetation to respond to and interact with climate provide a unique method for addressing questions regarding feedbacks between the ecosystem and climate in pre-Quaternary time periods. In this paper, we consider how Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), which have been developed for simulations with present day climate, can be used for paleoclimate studies. We begin with a series of tests in the NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM)-DGVM with Eocene geography to examine (1) the effect of removing C-4 grasses from the available plant functional types in the model; (2) model sensitivity to a change in soil texture; and (3), model sensitivity to a change in the value of pCO(2), used in the photosynthetic rate equations. The tests were designed to highlight some of the challenges of using these models and prompt discussion of possible improvements. We discuss how lack of detail in model boundary conditions, uncertainties in the application of modem plant functional types to paleoflora simulations, and inaccuracies in the model climatology used to drive the DGVM can affect interpretation of model results. However, we also review a number of DGVM features that can facilitate understanding of past climates and offer suggestions for improving paleo-DGVM studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rhodoliths (free-living coralline red algae) can thrive under a wide range of temperatures, reduced light, and increased nutrient levels, and often form a distinct so-called rhodalgal lithofacies that is an important component of Cenozoic shallow-water carbonates. Global distributions illustrate that from the late-early to early-late Miocene (Burdigalian-early Tortonian), rhodalgal facies reached peak abundances and commonly replaced coral-reef environments, accompanied by a decline in other carbonate-producing phototrophs. We argue that the dominance of red algae over coral reefs was triggered in the Burdigalian by enhanced trophic resources associated with a global increase in productivity, as evidenced by a long-term shift toward higher carbon isotope values. Rhodalgal lithofacies expanded further in the middle Miocene when strengthened thermal gradients associated with the establishment of the East Antarctic lee Sheet led to enhanced upwelling while climate change generated increased weathering rates, introducing land-derived nutrients into the oceans. Globally cooler temperatures following a climatic optimum in the early-middle Miocene contributed to sustain the dominance of red algae and prevented the recovery of coral reefs. The global shift in nearshore shallow-water carbonate producers to groups tolerant of higher levels of trophic resources provides further evidence for increased nutrient levels during that time interval and shows the sensitivity of shallow-water carbonate facies as indicators of past oceanographic conditions.

AB  - The relationship between faecal nitrogen (FN), dietary nitrogen (DN) and dietary metabolizable energy (DE) was studied in two localities in the region of the Jeseniky Mts, Czech Republic, during four seasons. The content of nitrogen in plants significant for nutrition ranged between 0.99 and 3.86 g/kg of dry matter and DE was from 7.8 to 10.7 MJ/kg of dry matter. The DN/DE ratio in individual plant species ranged from 1:2.49 (stinging nettle) to 1:9.05 (rowan). The content of nitrogen in vegetation samples correlated with the content of DE in all four seasons (p < 0.01). In both the red and roe deer the diet contained more DN and DE during the vegetation season (spring to autumn) than in winter. The content of FN corresponded to the changes in diet quality and was positively correlated with DN and DE contents in all cases. On the basis of the correlations found between FN and diet quality we conclude that the use of FN for evaluation of diet quality in ungulates is possible, on the condition that we know the composition of their diet in the studied environment. However, it is unwise to compare different feeding specialists or individuals of one species living in different habitats with different diet composition.

AB  - Abundance-weighted averages of diatom indicator values for pH, salinity, organic nitrogen availability, oxygen saturation, saprobity and trophic status according to van Dam et al. [Neth. J. Aquat. Ecol. 28 (1994) 117] were calculated for surface sediment and epiphytic diatom assemblages in 186 standing waters distributed throughout Flanders, Belgium, and tested against environmental variables measured in the water column, covering water chemistry, trophic status and organic load. With exception of the pH indication, most scores related rather poorly to variables which they are assumed to reflect and correlated even more strongly to non-target variables. For instance, the trophic indication provided a measure of pH and base status rather than of nutrient levels or phytoplankton productivity. Relations to measured variables differed according to the pH regime. Correction for uneven distribution of indicator values in the species pool usually yielded little improvement and was detrimental in some cases. Compared to epiphyton, weighted averages of species indicator values derived from sediment assemblages tended to be higher in water bodies yielding the most elevated indication scores. Except for the pH and salinity indication, differences between weighted averages pertaining to these different habitats were often considerable. Limitations to the use of abundance-weighted averages of diatom indicator values for environmental monitoring and assessment of lentic waters are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The herbivorous blue-banded surgeonfish, Acanthurus lineatus, was a major species harvested on coral reefs in American Samoa, accounting for 39% by weight of artisanal catches in 1994. Spawning occurred year-round but peaked during the austral spring and summer (October-February). A dense pulse of recruits (0.4-0.6 recruits/m(2)) settled onto the outer reef flat in March-April. Apparent survival was low during the first year but increased thereafter (80%/year). The fish were strongly site-attached on a daily basis, but an estimated 60% of the adults switched territories at least once during a a-year period, thereby negating attempts to estimate mortality through attrition rates of marked individuals, Estimates of fish condition changed through the year, generally paralleling seasonal changes in a suite of environmental factors. The fish grew rapidly, attaining 70-80% of their total growth during their first year, followed by slow growth and long life (up to 18 years), characteristics that confounded standard growth analyses by producing age-specific growth parameters. Growth was best described by a two-phase von Bertalanffy growth curve for ages 0-3 (K=1.1) and ages 4-18 (K=0.12, L infinity=22.1 cm), with the separation based on the age at which 50% of the population reached maturity. Indicators of fishing pressure over a 9-year period were equivocal but did not point to significant overfishing.

AB  - The present study was designed to compare the effects of a pharmacologically induced decrease in body core temperature to the effects observed with lowering of body temperature by exposure to a cold environment. Our special interest was the involvement of 5-HT in thermoregulatory responses. Sixty healthy male volunteers were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: exposure to normal ambient temperature (28-degrees-C) and placebo, exposure to cold ambient temperature (5-degrees-C) and placebo, or normal ambient temperature and 10 mg of the partial 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone. As indicators of physiological responses to lowering of body temperature, tympanic temperature, skin temperature, EMA, metabolic rate, and heart rate were monitored and saliva cortisol levels and peripheral 5-HT concentrations were determined. In addition, ratings on ambient temperature, thermal discomfort, and feelings of irritability were obtained. While lowering of body core temperature was associated with marked counterregulations (decrease of skin temperature, increase in EMA and metabolic rate) and feelings of discomfort, this was not observed with ipsapirone. An increase in cortisol levels was primarily observed in the ipsapirone group and was not reflected by respective changes in whole blood or platelet 5-HT indicating that brain and platelet 5-HT are not related.

Ambient water was collected from the following locations and transported back to our laboratory for testing: Elizabeth River (VA), Patapsco River (MD), Wye River (MD), and Potomac River (three freshwater and two saltwater stations). The Potomac River stations were located at Indian Head (MD), Freestone Point (VA), Possum Point (VA), Morgantown (MD), and Dahlgren (VA). A suite of inorganic and organic contaminants and water quality conditions were evaluated in ambient water during the tests. Results from the water column tests demonstrated no significant ranking of sensitivity among the three saltwater tests, but rather supported the need for multispecies tests because different species displayed varying sensitivity to different types of contaminants. Biological effects were reported from at least one test species tested in ambient water from Elizabeth River, Patapsco River, Indian Head, Morgantown, and Dahlgren. These results demonstrate that selected ambient areas of the Chesapeake Bay watershed are toxic, based on various biological indicators.

AB  - Organic aggregates, which formed from small particles and dissolved material, were chemically characterized in the Long Island Sound coastal waters. In this study, six aggregation experiments were conducted on low-salinity samples (the Thames River, CT, USA; salinity of 6.3-6.8) and high-salinity samples (the coast of Avery Point, CT, USA; salinity of 21.4-26.7). Water samples were incubated on a roller table for two days under dark conditions to generate laboratory-made aggregates. Particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations increased 5-39% after two days of rolling. A higher POC increase occurred in low-salinity samples. The concentrations of neutral aldoses and amino acids, as well as their C- and N-yields, decreased during the experiments (except for particulate hydrolysable amino acid in low-salinity samples), while bacterial abundance increased 50-476%, indicating microbial degradation of biologically labile organic matter. Particulate hydrolysable amino acid was preferentially preserved in P-limited systems. An enrichment factor analysis showed the preferential microbial degradation of particulate hydrolysable neutral aldose and glucose appeared as the most labile aldose. The increase in bulk POC and the decrease in the fraction of labile organic carbon (neutral aldose and amino acid) in the particulate phase resulted in an accumulation of uncharacterized (presumably more refractory) particulate organic matter.

AB  - Based on 2004-2017 Chinese interprovincial panel data, we construct the regional environmental pollution indicators, analyze the influencing factors and spillover effects of environmental pollution under the conditions of time lag, spatial lag, and spatiotemporal lag by using the STIRPAT model and dynamic spatial Durbin model, and discuss the spatiotemporal characteristics of regional environmental pollution in China. The results show that the overall regional environmental pollution in China is on the decline. Environmental pollution has strengthened the characteristics of strong in the East and weak in the West, and the characteristics of strong in the South and weak in the North began to appear. Population scale, economic growth, and industrial scale will increase environmental pollution in the region, and the environmental regulation intensity and pollution control investment will reduce environmental pollution in the region. The spillover effects of the influencing factors of regional environmental pollution in China are different. In the short term, the influencing factors have a greater impact on the neighboring areas, while in the long term, they have a greater impact on the region. Hence, the critical approach to achieving sustainable development is to give full play to the factors which can reduce environmental pollution and to effectively control the factors which will promote environmental pollution.

AB  - The United States has the highest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Previous studies reported that urban residents are more vulnerable to the spread and mortality of COVID-19 than rural residents. However, the pathways through which urban environments affect COVID-19 spread and mortality are unclear. We collected daily data on the number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from Mar. 01 to Nov. 16, 2020 for all 91 counties in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the United States. We calculated the COVID-19 incidence %, daily reproduction number, and mortality %, then estimated the associations with urban environment indicators using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were generally highest in areas with high population density, and this pattern was evident in the early period of epidemic. Among the area-level demographic variables, the percentage of Black or Hispanic residents showed the strongest positive association with COVID-19 outcomes. Higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes was also associated with higher percentage of overcrowded households, uninsured people, and income inequality. The percent elderly, sex ratio (the ratio of males to females), and greenness were negatively associated with risk of COVID-19 outcomes. The results of this study could indicate where resources are most needed.

AB  - Mining is an important activity of the primary sector with strong economic and environmental impacts. All over the world, governments have made efforts to regulate mine restoration by monitoring and assessing the evolution of mined sites. Our work aims to synthesize various remote sensing applications into a single workflow in order to obtain cartographic products using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), not only for mine restoration management, but also as a way of monitoring mining activity as a whole. The workflow performs image processing and terrain analysis calculations, which conduct a supervised classification of the land cover. The resulting mapping products include orthoimagery, Digital Surface Models (DSM), land cover maps, volume variation calculations, dust deposition, detection of erosion problems, and drainage network evaluation maps. The data obtained from red-green-blue (RGB) sensors has a spatial resolution of 4-10 cm, providing information that allows the characterization of land covers with an overall accuracy of 91%. In comparison, if using multispectral sensors with the same flight conditions than RGB, image spatial resolution diminishes and land cover characterization accuracy drops to 81%. The resulting digital maps can be fully integrated into Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allowing the quantification of environmental features and spatial changes. Our study provides the basis for creating a large-scale, replicable and ready-to-use workflow suited for monitoring the exploitation of minerals and mine restoration using RGB imagery obtained through drones.

AB  - Relationships between biomass and ecological factors including trophic interactions were examined to understand the dynamics of six fish species in Lake Vortsjarv, a large shallow eutrophic lake located in Estonia (north-eastern Europe). The database contained initially 31 predictive variables that were monitored in situ for nearly forty years. The strongest predictive variables were selected by three parallel approaches: single correlation (Pearson). a multivariate method (Co-inertia analyses), and a machine learning algorithm (Random Forests), followed by a Generalized Least Squares model to determine meaningful relationships with fish biomass. Models with both additive and interactive effects were constructed. The results revealed that the indicators of degraded ecological conditions (high cyanobacteria biomass and their proportion in total phytoplankton, high summer temperature, high nutrient concentration) were negatively correlated to fish biomass. Benthic macroinvertebrates and other biotic predictors (biomass of specific fish prey and predators) were also important contributors to fish biomass dynamics. Together, abiotic and biotic factors explained 40-60% of the variance of fish biomass, depending of the species. Our findings suggest that both abiotic and biotic factors control fish biomass changes in this eutrophic lake. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water quality monitoring with integrative tools is a main issue of concern for environment assessment. Submerged aquatic macrophyte can be a good candidate for the evaluation of contaminant content in rivers. Indeed, owing to their habitat, aquatic macrophytes interact directly with surface water; they can absorb contaminants and thus allow to detect their presence in water. In situ studies were conducted over 28 days in five aquatic environments, affected by different levels of anthropogenic pressure (domestic wastewater plant, industrial activities), during two field campaigns. We have investigated whether the accumulation of some metals and a metalloid (As) in Myriophyllum alterniflorum could be used to detect their occurrence in river waters. Our results demonstrated that long time bioaccumulation was correlated with the contaminant levels in water. However, the water composition and the duration of exposure affected the studied pollutants' absorption. On an operational point of view, the optimal duration of exposure of Myriophyllum alterniflorum to assess the water quality is conditioned by the contaminant contents in waters that can induce different defense mechanisms as the reduction of pollutant absorption and their efflux. In addition, the nutrient concentration influenced the accumulation of pollutants since the higher the nutrient level, the higher the essential metal accumulation was observed.

AB  - The global healthcare landscape is continuously changing throughout the world as technology advances, leading to a gradual change in lifestyle. Several diseases such as asthma and cardiovascular conditions are becoming more diffuse, due to a rise in pollution exposure and a more sedentary lifestyle. Healthcare providers deal with increasing new challenges, and thanks to fast-developing big data technologies, they can be faced with systems that provide direct support to citizens. In this context, within the EU-funded Participatory Urban Living for Sustainable Environments (PULSE) project, we are implementing a data analytic platform designed to provide public health decision makers with advanced approaches, to jointly analyze maps and geospatial information with healthcare and air pollution data. In this paper we describe a component of such platforms, which couples deep learning analysis of urban geospatial images with healthcare indexes collected by the 500 Cities project. By applying a pre-learned deep Neural Network architecture, satellite images ofNewYork City are analyzed and latent feature variables are extracted. These features are used to derive clusters, which are correlated with healthcare indicators by means of a multivariate classification model. Thanks to this pipeline, it is possible to show that, in New York City, health care indexes are significantly correlated to the urban landscape. This pipeline can serve as a basis to ease urban planning, since the same interventions can be organized on similar areas, even if geographically distant.

AB  - A recently developed bootstrap autoregressive-distributed lag test with structural breaks has been used to test the cointegration and causality regarding major economies worldwide, in order to investigate the relationship between electricity and economic growth during the period 1971-2014. Although a long-run cointegrating relationship between the time series of real GDP and electricity consumption per capita cannot be sufficiently detected, the results of this research show the contingency of causality. In India, the past histories of electricity consumption serve as a predictive indicator influencing the present states of economic growth. Positive and negative feedback exists in the United States and China, respectively. The results of the growth hypothesis support the government in India budgeting an enormous amount of money for its infrastructural development in the fiscal year 2017-2018. The government in the United States continues to investigate modern methods of developing the supply of electricity, such as renewable energy technologies. After the economic growth in China, Chinese citizens live in better conditions and garner a higher level of culture. Thus, they may pursue lower-energy-consuming products to strive for a better environment. Based on empirical analysis, certain policy and managerial implications have been addressed by decision-makers at the macroeconomic and micro-economic levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diffusion coefficient of carbon dioxide (CO2), a significant parameter describing the mass transfer process, exerts a profound influence on the safety of CO2 storage in depleted reservoirs, saline aquifers, and marine ecosystems. However, experimental determination of diffusion coefficient in CO2-brine system is time-consuming and complex because the procedure requires sophisticated laboratory equipment and reasonable interpretation methods. To facilitate the acquisition of more accurate values, an intelligent model, termed MKSVM-GA, is developed using a hybrid technique of support vector machine (SVM), mixed kernels (MK), and genetic algorithm (GA). Confirmed by the statistical evaluation indicators, our proposed model exhibits excellent performance with high accuracy and strong robustness in a wide range of temperatures (273-473.15 K), pressures (0.1-49.3 MPa), and viscosities (0.139-1.950 mPa.s). Our results show that the proposed model is more applicable than the artificial neural network (ANN) model at this sample size, which is superior to four commonly used traditional empirical correlations. The technique presented in this study can provide a fast and precise prediction of CO2 diffusivity in brine at reservoir conditions for the engineering design and the technical risk assessment during the process of CO2 injection.

AB  - Higher rates of nuclear anomalies in buccal cells of coffee workers exposed to pesticides in comparison to their unexposed peers were detected in our field study. Here, we extend our findings by examining other exposure indicators in this sample. Occupational exposure of 38 exposed and 33 non-exposed farmworkers was assessed as exposure days in the last month (0-25 days) and as years of exposure (0-47 years). Genotoxic and cytotoxic markers in buccal cells were analysed following standard procedures for buccal micronucleus cytome assay. Both exposure markers were associated with a higher frequency of nuclear anomalies with odds ratios more than 1. After restricting the analysis to the exposed workers only, this association remained only with the marker of recent exposure. In a secondary analysis also environmental exposure defined as proximity of the home to the nearest sprayed field (distance <1000 m) was assessed. Proximity led to increased rates (with odds ratios more than 3) of genotoxic but not cytotoxic nuclear anomalies. Reported recent frequency and intensity of pesticide use and application are a valid exposure marker relevant for cytological pathologies in the buccal mucosa. The exposure metric for environmental exposure was rather crude and confounding by some unmeasured factor cannot be fully excluded. Nevertheless, simple exposure indicators that can even be obtained under rather difficult field conditions do provide health-relevant and valid information.

AB  - Robotics in agriculture has experienced enormous development in the past decade. In order to accomplish numerous agricultural tasks, the order in which the crop is covered is particularly important in order to minimise travelling cost and to preserve soil conditions. However, it is difficult to determine an optimised sequential path for the robot which minimizes navigation costs, while ensuring a fully completed agricultural operation. This paper presents the implementation of a multi-objective algorithm to solve the path planning problem for pesticide spraying operation inside a greenhouse. Pesticide spraying problems found in greenhouses have been adapted from the vehicle routing problem found in operations research, where the infected plants represent the customers and the mobile robot represents the vehicles. Routes between the plants are generated using a Probabilistic Roadmap path planner based on the designed virtual environment. The virtual environment is designed based on the real greenhouse environment to visualise the agricultural operation inside the greenhouse. To determine the best routes for the mobile robot, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm using Reference Point Based (NSGA-III) is tested and applied to the system. The solution quality has been compared with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) using the C-metric indicator. Comparisons with NSGA-II using the C-metric indicator verify that NSGA-III offers a superior performance with a good quality result.

AB  - In recent years, there is a trend towards increasing consumption of natural therapeutic agents to manage the symptoms of menopause. Common ingredients in natural preparations include Cranberry extract, Oenotherabiennis oil, Glycine max, Cimicifuga racemose extract, and others. They improve the physical and emotional health of menopausal women and help to overcome hormonal imbalance.
   The study is conducted on the territory of Varna Municipality through a direct anonymous inquiry during the period January - March 2018. The study included 50 female respondents (n=50) with menopausal symptoms, between the age of 35 and 65 years.
   The study results demonstrated the increase in consumption of natural preparations for managing menopausal symptoms (86% of respondents). The herbal product and/or nutrition supplement that respondents take contain mostly calcium in combination with vitamin D, cranberry extract and evening primrose oil. To a lower extent, female respondents take preparations which contain soy phytoestrogens or silver candle herb.
   A big relative share of respondents (76%) reported for significant improvement in their health condition. There is a positive correlation between this indicator and the longer period of natural product intake. Regarding the subjective assessment of respondents about the price of the natural product they use, 74% of women claim that they can afford it. There is no direct relationship between the monthly income of respondents and the way they define the price.

AB  - This study explored the effects of EpichloA << gansuensis endophyte on water use efficiency (WUE), nutrient content and biomass accumulation of Achnatherum inebrians (drunken horse grass, DHG) under varying water availability. It also examined possible transgenerational effects (TGE) on above indicators.
   DHG with (EI) and without endophyte (EF), from seed of plants of the same seed-line that had been grown in Yuzhong (YZ-D, relatively dry) and Xiahe (XH-W, relatively wet), were grown under limited water conditions (LWC). Plant height, leaf number and chlorophyll content were monitored dynamically. After 10 weeks, the biomass, photosynthetic indexes and C, N, P content of plants was determined.
   The endophyte increased plant height and chlorophyll content, but decreased plant leaf number, and the CO2 concentration, while increasing other photosynthetic indexes. The biomass, N and P content were higher in EI than EF plants of the YZ-D DHG, but not the C content and root weight. However, there were almost no significant affects on these factors between EI and EF plants of the XH-W DHG.
   The endophyte enhanced WUE and maintained the growth of plants under LWC by improving photosynthetic efficiency and promoting nutrient absorption. However, TGE also affected this process.

AB  - Drinking water safety is increasingly perceived as one of the top global environmental issues. Plankton has been commonly used as a bioindicator for water quality in lakes and reservoirs. Recently, DNA sequencing technology has been applied to bioassessment. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of the 16S and 18S rRNA high throughput sequencing method (HTS) and the traditional optical microscopy method (TOM) in the bioassessment of drinking water quality. Five stations reflecting different habitats and hydrological conditions in Danjiangkou Reservoir, one of the largest drinking water reservoirs in Asia, were sampled May 2016. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed that plankton assemblages varied among the stations and the spatial patterns revealed by the two methods were consistent. The correlation between TOM and HTS in a symmetric Procrustes analysis was 0.61, revealing overall good concordance between the two methods. Procrustes analysis also showed that site-specific differences between the two methods varied among the stations. Station Heijizui (H), a site heavily influenced by two tributaries, had the largest difference while station Qushou (Q), a confluence site close to the outlet dam, had the smallest difference between the two methods. Our results show that DNA sequencing has the potential to provide consistent identification of taxa, and reliable bioassessment in a long-term biomonitoring and assessment program for drinking water reservoirs.

AB  - Wildfires and agricultural activities are relevant factors affecting soil quality, hydrological cycle and sedimentary dynamics. Land abandonment leads to afforestation, which increases fire risk and land degradation. However, no studies have yet evaluated the effect of combining the two factors, which occur frequently in Mediterranean ecosystems. This study assessed the changes in soil quality caused by the abandonment of terraces in two microcatchments (< 2.5 ha) affected distinctly by wildfires (once and twice burned) and in an unburned control microcatchment by analyzing soil quality parameters, biochemical indices and spatial patterns of hydrological and sediment connectivity. Soil samples were collected in thirty-six plots (25 m(2)) representing terraced and non-terraced areas within these microcatchments. Unburned non-terraced plots had higher organic matter content and higher microbiological and enzymatic activities than other plots. Plots in abandoned terraces had lower soil quality indices, regardless of the fire effect. Land abandonment induced changes in the spatial patterns of hydrological connectivity, leading to concentrated runoff, enhanced erosion and soil degradation. Fire also negatively affected soil quality in both terraced and non-terraced plots. However, microbiological communities had different positive post-fire recovery strategies (growth and activity), depending on the previous soil conditions and land uses, which is indicative of the resilience of Mediterranean soil ecosystems.

AB  - The present study prompted the second attempts to evaluate biochemical responses of filamentous algae under different physico-chemical variables in various water bodies in Turkey. These variables were investigated by use of multivariate approach in the years of 2013 (May and November) and 2014 (May and October). Studied ecoregions had the different geographic position, climate, land-use, and anthropogenic activities, could strongly affect physico-chemical variables of water bodies, which caused to change or regulate in algal biomass composition due to the different response of filamentous species. Besides, biochemical responses of species changed at different sampling times and stations. Multivariate analyses indicated that temperature, heavy metals, and nutrient contents of aquatic systems were found to be major variables driving the spatial and temporal occurrence and biochemical contents of filamentous species. Total protein and pigment production by filamentous algae were high in water bodies having high nutrients, whereas they were low in high heavy metal contents. Amount of malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2, total thiol group, total phenolic compounds, proline, total carbohydrate, and bioaccumulation of metals by filamentous algae were closely related with heavy metal contents of water bodies, indicated by the multivariate approach. Significant increase in aforementioned biochemical compounds with a distinct range of habitats and sensitive-tolerance to environmental conditions could make them highly valuable indicators.

AB  - This work studies solid-liquid phase change around a tube in a latent energy storage unit with cyclic thermal loading and unloading (i.e. alternate heating and cooling), while taking into account natural convection. A scale analysis is used to predict the tube surface temperature and the extent of the molten and solidified zones around the tube as a function of the main governing dimensionless parameters (the Stefan and Rayleigh numbers, and the period of the imposed sinusoidal heat transfer rate). A numerical model is then developed to simulate the process under a periodic regime and verify the scale analysis. Temperature, liquid fraction and flow fields are reported as a function of the main governing parameters. A frequency analysis is also proposed to develop a better understanding of how the system behaves. It is shown that the dimensionless group Pr/(similar to, tau Ra(1/5)Ste) allows to determine the importance of natural convection in the system. Results indicate that the size of the zone affected by the alternate heating and cooling increases when the period or the Stefan number increased, but was less sensitive to the Rayleigh number. Correlations are proposed to determine the maximal dimensions reached by the melt and by the solid around the tube. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Affordable and efficient urban public transport is important for the development of a sustainable urban environment. Making sure public transport users are satisfied with the service is a goal many public transport agencies are trying to achieve. Customer satisfaction surveys are often used to monitor customer perceptions of service quality and to determine the relative influence of service attributes on a customer's overall assessment of the service. This study presents a new method to spatially evaluate customer satisfaction survey data through examining satisfaction with bus service across neighbourhoods of varying levels of socio-economic status (SES). Using customer satisfaction survey data collected by Transport for London between 2010 and 2015, multi-level regression modeling is used to estimate the relationship between overall satisfaction and social deprivation of the area in which bus routes were operating. The results indicate lower levels of satisfaction along routes serving low SES neighbourhoods, which appears to be attributed to (1) low satisfaction with service characteristics related to an individual's experience and quality of the bus and (2) conditions of the bus stop and shelter. Findings from this paper shows the importance of including cleanliness and bus internal quality as one of the performance indicators when contracting bus services, to ensure that all customers receive the same quality of service in the region regardless of their SES.

AB  - The sustainability performance of cities is subject to an ever-growing number of monitoring tools. While most initiatives work with outcome indicators that are generally associated with limited direct policy relevance, a minority of tools focuses on sustainability-related processes and particularly local government policies. In this article, we explore the benefits, limitations and conditions under which this approach can function. While several process-oriented tools offered to European local governments have lacked participation and foundered, the Local Sustainability Meter (LSM) has been widely used in the Netherlands, with close to 90% of all Dutch municipalities participating since 1999 in some of its multi-year editions. An evaluative case study presented in this article shows that the LSM stimulated competition for policy performance, conceptual learning and the strengthening of local governance and inter-municipal networks. The LSM's design choices of combining voluntary, transparent self-assessments at periodic intervals with public rankings and awards proved to be an effective - and economic - way of disseminating sustainability policies. Its limitations include an inherent focus on generic, standardized policy prescriptions and little knowledge on actual sustainability outcomes. These findings are relevant for policy-makers and developers of (local) sustainability monitoring tools. This study contributes to the growing literature on (i) sustainability policies and (ii) municipal monitoring and ranking tools. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Reported concentrations of dioxin-like compounds accumulated in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) were used to perform a risk assessment for eel larval survival, taking into account a modeled amplification of tissue concentrations with a factor of 1.33 during spawning migration. The calculated concentrations of dioxin-like compounds finally deposited in the eggs were compared with the internal effect concentrations for survival of early life stages of the European eel; these concentrations, by lack of experimental data, were estimated from a sensitivity distribution based on literature data by assuming that eel larvae are among the 10% most sensitive teleost fish species. Given concentrations of dioxin-like contaminants and assuming a relatively high sensitivity, it can be expected that larvae from eggs produced by eel from highly contaminated locations in Europe will experience increased mortality as a result of maternally transferred dioxin-like contaminants. As historical persistent organic pollutant concentrations in eel tissue were higher, this impact must have been stronger in the past. Potential effects of other compounds or effects on the migration, condition, and fertility of the parental animals were not taken into account. It is important to further study the overall impact of contaminants on the reproductive success of the European eel as this may have been underestimated until now. (C) 2015 SETAC

AB  - The efficient capitalisation of agricultural land is dependent on determining the environmental suitability of the area and on identifying the MOSE appropriate culture types for a particular terrain. Because of its complex landforms, the anthropic pressure and the irrational use of land on large surfaces, the Basin of Niraj River was the object of a reorganising process in the production activities, by emphasising the agricultural land use as a resource for sustainable development, which has been too long underexploited. The technique of capability classification, in collaboration with the GIS techniques of spatial analysis, represents one of the most facile and concrete ways of identifying and creating an inventory of lands which fulfil the best conditions for the creation of orchards, through the use of specific indicators: climatic, morphometric, morphologic, pedologic. The present study created a new GIS model of spatial analysis, which could offer a new approach to the classical method of land capability classification. The identification of the areas which are suitable for fruit tree cultivation was based on this model by integrating the specific indicators into databases and GIS spatial analysis equations. The results of this study highlights the maps of the land favorability for apple trees, pear trees, plum trees, cherry trees, peach trees and apricot trees and a geodatabase materialization in the maps of quality classes for orchards.

AB  - In this study, simulated solar disinfection of secondary effluent was followed by dark storage at different temperatures or different receiving water matrices. Escherichia coli illumination was followed by 3-day monitoring of the bacterial population and its adaptation in different temperature conditions in the dark. The subsequent survival was linked to the dose received during exposure to light, and results were obtained on the environmentally induced prolongation of survival, maintenance of population or excessive growth, at 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively. An additional set of experiments at 20 degrees C was subjected to dilution in E. coli-free synthetic wastewater, water from Lake Leman, (synthetic) seawater and Mili-Q water. Post-irradiation monitoring was also conducted, studying 50%, 10% and 1% dilution rates, and the results were attributed to the two parameters of dilution medium and dilution ratio. However, different responses were found based on the acquired dose during pre-treatment. This indicates the importance of the illumination prior to storage, and the preference of bacteria in some matrices over the others. Survival was linked to initial population, dose, dilution and medium; shorter illumination times are to be considered according to the receiving water matrix. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A simulation software (ARRPA) has been developed in Microsoft Visual Basic platform for optimization and control of a novel membrane-integrated arsenic separation plant in the backdrop of absence of such software. The user-friendly, menu-driven software is based on a dynamic linearized mathematical model, developed for the hybrid treatment scheme. The model captures the chemical kinetics in the pre-treating chemical reactor and the separation and transport phenomena involved in nanofiltration. The software has been validated through extensive experimental investigations. The agreement between the outputs from computer simulation program and the experimental findings are excellent and consistent under varying operating conditions reflecting high degree of accuracy and reliability of the software. High values of the overall correlation coefficient (R (2) = 0.989) and Willmott d-index (0.989) are indicators of the capability of the software in analyzing performance of the plant. The software permits pre-analysis, manipulation of input data, helps in optimization and exhibits performance of an integrated plant visually on a graphical platform. Performance analysis of the whole system as well as the individual units is possible using the tool. The software first of its kind in its domain and in the well-known Microsoft Excel environment is likely to be very useful in successful design, optimization and operation of an advanced hybrid treatment plant for removal of arsenic from contaminated groundwater.

AB  - A granular material (GM) to be used as road sub-base was formulated using 80% of weathered bottom ash (WBA) and 20% of mortar. The mortar was prepared separately and consisted in 50% APC and 50% of Portland cement. A pilot-scale study was carried on by constructing three roads in order to environmentally evaluate the performance of GM in a real scenario. By comparing the field results with those of the column experiments, the overestimations observed at laboratory scale can be explained by the potential mechanisms in which water enters into the road body and the pH of the media. An exception was observed in the case of Cu, whose concentration release at the test road was higher. The long-time of exposure at atmospheric conditions might have favoured oxidation of organic matter and therefore the leaching of this element. The results obtained showed that immobilization of all heavy metals and metalloids from APC is achieved by the pozzolanic effect of the cement mortar. This is, to the knowledge of the authors, the only pilot scale study that is considering reutilization of APC as a safe way to disposal. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic and planktonic foraminifera were studied in inner shelf sedimentary sequences in Haifa Bay, Israel. Three boreholes, taken at water depths from 5 to 14 m, spanning about the last 1 Ma, and a set of modern sediment samples used as modern analogue, were utilized for reconstructing palaeoenvironments and palaeobathymetry. The palaeoenvironmental data were used for assessing tectonic activity of the Carmel Fault, a branch of the Dead Sea transform that bounds the southern side of the bay. Quantitative analyses showed four biofacies: a fresh to brackish wetland environment, and three progressively deepening marine biofacies. Relative water depth ranges were estimated using changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages, presence or absence of Ammonia sp. 1, and the percentage of planktonic foraminifera.
   The distribution of the biofacies suggests water depths no deeper than 15 m during most interglacial stages, water depths to 15-40 m during short transgressive phases of MIS 5.5, 7, 11 and 13, and water depth reaching 40-80 m in the earliest transgressive phases (MIS 27? and MIS 29?). The environmental conditions on both sides of the fault were quite similar along the succession. This suggests that the movements of the uplifted and down-faulted blocks have more or less coincided since about 1 Ma. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change plays an important role in affecting and altering the course of human development. So far, there have been no effective and efficient techniques to directly quantify the influences of climate change on human development, but there have been rough estimation and qualitative description of the effects. Since the 1990s, climate change considerations have been required to be included in environmental impact assessment, which is a flexible institutional framework of environmental risk evaluation and management. However, there have been no concrete achievements demonstrated. The purpose of this study was first to summarise the practical experience and to disclose the existing problems during the implementation of the process of integrating climate change considerations into environmental impact assessment in China through a case study. Currently in China, the practice of integrating climate change considerations into environmental impact assessment is mainly concentrated on the strategic environmental assessment level. The influences of climate change were identified as energy consumption, greenhouse gases emission, and the restraint of development under abnormal or extreme weather or climate conditions. Because of a lack of related technical guidelines and practical experience, the climate change considerations that have been selected and the evaluation methods that have been applied are quite different. Recommendations on policies, laws, and institutional regulations institution are proposed to better utilise environmental impact assessment to integrate climate change considerations into economic, social, and environmental decisions and actions.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are widespread in methane-rich subsurface environments, such as oil reservoirs and fuel-contaminated aquifers; however, little is known about the biodegradation of these compounds under methanogenic conditions. To assess the metabolism of PAH in the absence of electron acceptors, a crude oil-degrading methanogenic enrichment culture was tested for the ability to biodegrade naphthalene, 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN), 2-methylnaphthalene (2-MN), and 2, 6-dimethylnaphthalene (2, 6-diMN). When methane was measured as an indicator of metabolism, nearly 400 mu mol of methane was produced in the 2-MN- and 2, 6-diMN-amended cultures relative to substrate-unamended controls, which is close to the amount of methane stoichiometrically predicted based on the amount of substrate added (5156 mu mol). In contrast, no substantial methane was produced in the naphthalene- and 1-MN-amended enrichments. In time course experiments, metabolite analysis of enrichments containing 2-MN and 2, 6-diMN revealed the formation of 2-naphthoic acid and 6-methyl-2-naphthoic acid, respectively. Microbial community analysis by 454 pyrosequencing revealed that these PAH-utilizing enrichments were dominated by archaeal members most closely affiliated with Methanosaeta and Methanoculleus species and bacterial members most closely related to the Clostridiaceae, suggesting that these organisms play an important role in the methanogenic metabolism of the substituted naphthalenes in these cultures.

   The vocal repertoire of some animal species has been considered a non-invasive tool to predict distress reactivity. In rats ultrasound emissions were reported as distress indicator. Capybaras' vocal repertoire was reported recently and seems to have ultrasound calls, but this has not yet been confirmed. Thus, in order to check if a poor state of welfare was linked to ultrasound calls in the capybara vocal repertoire, the aim of this study was to track the presence of ultrasound emissions in 11 animals under three conditions: 1) unrestrained; 2) intermediately restrained, and 3) highly restrained. The ultrasound track identified frequencies in the range of 31.8+/-3.5 kHz in adults and 33.2+/-8.5 kHz in juveniles. These ultrasound frequencies occurred only when animals were highly restrained, physically restrained or injured during handling. We concluded that these calls with ultrasound components are related to pain and restraint because they did not occur when animals were free of restraint. Thus we suggest that this vocalization may be used as an additional tool to assess capybaras' welfare.

AB  - In a network of six old-growth and three managed beech forests, distributed over a wide altitudinal range in the Central Apennines, we used principal component analysis to analyse a set of 15 commonly used structural and chronological indicators of old-growthness, related to both live trees and deadwood. Our goals were to (1) quantify the effectiveness of such indicators for ranking forests according to their degree of old-growthness and (2) disentangle the effects of site-related (e. g. elevation) and human-related (e. g. past management) factors on their variation. We selected eight indicators as best descriptors of forest old-growthness: mean age of the five oldest trees; snag volume; coarse woody debris (CWD) volume; density of medium-size snags [diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 47.5 cm]; forest stature; basal area; established regeneration and density of large trees (DBH >= 67.5 cm). We analysed their relative importance in informing us about the degree of old-growthness in our forests. Our findings suggest that several old-growthness indicators are to be considered carefully, because they are strongly linked to site conditions and particularly to the biogeoclimatic context. Moreover, we provide evidence for how past management can produce negative effects on some indicators.

AB  - Greater efforts to provide alternative scenarios are key to successful urban stream restoration planning. In this study, we discuss two different aspects of water quality management schemes, biodegradation and human health, which are incorporated in the restoration project of original, pristine condition of urban stream at the Gwangju (GJ) Stream, Korea. For this study, monthly monitoring of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) data were obtained from 2003 to 2008 and for 2008, respectively, and these were evaluated to explore pollutant magnitude and variation with respect to space and time window. Ideal scenarios to reduce target pollutants were determined based on their seasonal characteristics and correlations between the concentrations at a water intake and discharge point, where we suggested an increase of environmental flow and wetland as pollutants reduction drawing for BOD5 and FIB, respectively. The scenarios were separately examined by the Qual2E model and hypothetically (but planned) constructed wetland, respectively. The results revealed that while controlling of the water quality at the intake point guaranteed the lower pollution level of BOD5 in the GJ Stream, a wetland constructed at the discharge point may be a promising strategy to mitigate mass loads of FIB. Overall, this study suggests that a combination of the two can be plausible scenarios not only to support sustainable urban water resources management, but to enhance a quality of urban stream restoration assignment.

AB  - In situ growth rates are one measure of the physiological condition of larval Antarctic krill in winter. During the southern ocean global ecosystem dynamics (SO GLOBEC) research cruise in July/August 2001 aboard the ARSV Laurence M. Gould west of Adelaide Island and Marguerite Bay, larval krill were observed in the under-ice habitat. Ten instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larvae collected from the under-ice habitat on the outer shelf, mid-shelf, and just south of Adelaide Island in the mouth of Marguerite Bay. For all experiments, average growth increments for larval krill were about -1.6% per intermolt period, with a median intermolt period of 30.6d. Larvae were observed feeding on the ice, even though no color was visible in the ice. Pigment (chlorophyll a equivalents) content of larvae from three of the sites was measured as an indicator of ingestion of sea-ice microalgae. Pigment values were above those found in starved controls, but only about 20% of maximum possible values. Although feeding, the data suggested that the larval krill were unable to ingest enough food to maintain growth. The results from this first SO GLOBEC winter process cruise were compared to growth rates of larval krill during previous winter cruises that covered all months from late May through September, except for the month of August.

AB  - Quantification of effects from factors known to modify vegetative development and growth in grasses is important in modeling biomass yield. The objective of this study was to measure the effects of increasing levels of N on leaf appearance (LAR) and lamina extension rates (LER) in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) under field and controlled environmental conditions. Five nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates (0 to 268 kg N ha(-1)) were applied to a stand of "Alamo" switchgrass at Dallas, TX, and to potted plants (0 to 400 ppm) in a controlled environment. Quadratic regression models best described these responses to increasing rates of fertilizer N in both the field and controlled environment. In the field, LAR(-1) decreased to a minimum of 241 growing degree days (GDD) leaf(-1) at 163 kg Nha(-1) and LER increased to a maximum of 0.188 cm GDD(-1) at 164 kg Nha(-1). In the controlled environment, LAR(-1) decreased to a minimum of 155 GDD leaf(-1) at 90 ppm N and LER increased to a maximum of 0.272 cm GDD(-1) at 156 ppm N. Results demonstrate that LAR and LER are significantly affected by fertilizer N. Lamina extension rate responded to increasing levels of N in a manner typical of a classic yield response curve and was strongly correlated to plot yields, confirming its value as a potential indicator of yield.

AB  - We conducted a laboratory experiment to assess the effectiveness of nutrient (N and P) application to indigenous, marine microbial populations as a bioremediation technique to respond to oil spills along the temperate coastline of the western North Atlantic. We investigated the effects of various concentrations (10 ppm to 1 ppt) of No. 2 fuel oil, a commonly transported oil, on growth rates of the intertidal macroalga Fucus vesiculosus, We found growth inhibition after a one-day application of the lowest concentration tested and a clear dosage effect. The sensitivity of F. vesiculosus to oiling suggests that this abundant brown alga may serve as an effective indicator species. Nutrient (N + P) application as a bioremediation technique ameliorated the toxic effects of oil on F. vesiculosus without resulting in enrichment of macroalgal growth. Analysis of treatment samples with gas chromatography indicated greater microbial breakdown of the oil under enriched, compared with unenriched conditions. We measured a complete loss of n-alkanes, the preferred substrate by micro-organisms, from 'enriched+oiled' samples after 18 days, while oil introduced to autoclaved seawater showed only minimal degradation. Bioremediation may be a viable clean-up alternative for petroleum contamination of temperate ecosystems, particularly in areas of heavy shipping traffic, which probably support a relatively large background population of oil-degrading organisms.

AB  - The relationship between microcrustacean assemblage structure and flow habitat was investigated in 9 streams with differing hydraulic characteristics. A series of partial canonical correspondence analyses was used to relate species abundances of microcrustacea to geographical chemical hydraulic, and seasonal variables. Once the influence of geography (latitude) on species distributions was removed, the environmental variables accounted for almost 38% of the variation in the combined (all seasons) data set. Circumneutral streams had greater species richness and higher abundance of cosmopolitan species than more acidic streams. The microcrustacean assemblages were distinguished further on the basis of stream hydraulic character Previous research had categorised the 9 streams into Type I, II, or III depending on the fraction of stream bed retaining low shear stress at high discharge (declining from Types I to III). Taxa that are largely epibenthic in habit tended to be most abundant in Type I streams. These taxa may use as habitat the extensive low shear stress areas present in these streams, enabling their survival even at high discharge Conversely, taxa that are largely interstitial in habit tended to be most abundant in Type II and III streams. The distribution of interstitial taxa may reflect conditions within the substratum rather than at the surface The differences in microcrustacean assemblage structure were largely species-specific; the Harpacticoida were the only group to show a consistent pattern in relation to stream hydraulics.

KW  - OCEAN
AB  - The dissolution rate of liquid in CO2 in seawater, when a CO2 clathrate-hydrate film exists at the interface, is a key factor for estimation of CO2 sequestration in ocean and marine environmental impact assessment. Liquid CO2 dissolution phenomena in CO2 sequestration in the ocean include (i) dissolution and diffusion of liquid CO2 droplets at intermediate sea depths and (ii) CO2 dissolution in undercurrent flows from a liquid CO2 pool at seabeds deeper than 3000 m. For the first case, the present paper presents a data base of clathrate-hydrate covered CO2 droplet surface concentration, which is essential for an analysis of CO2 droplet dissolution behavior. Effects of pressure and temperature are included. A numerical simulation for dissolving liquid CO2 droplets released at an intermediate ocean depth is presented. The effects of released droplet size and ambient CO2 concentration on dissolution behavior are clarified. For the second case, an experiment simulating dissolution of liquid CO2 stared at a seabed into an undercurrent flow was conducted. The pool surface was covered with clathrate and the surface concentration of the clathrate-covered CO2 pool was estimated. Applying the measured surface concentration and mass transfer coefficient obtained from the actual conditions of deep ocean data, the time scale of CO2 dissolution into an undercurrent how was estimated, which is important for estimation of CO2 disposal in the deep ocean.

AB  - Ten populations of Radopholus similis from various locations and one population of Radopholus sp. from Indonesia were tested for their reproductive fitness and specific pathogenicity on Musa AAA, Cavendish cv. Poyo under controlled experimental conditions in a constant environment chamber. In addition, five of these populations were tested on Musa AAA, Ibota cv. Yangambi. Reproductive fitness of the populations tested on the two cultivars, measured as the ratio of the final number of nematodes per root system (P-f) to the number of nematodes inoculated (P-i), differed significantly. Greatest fitness was observed among R. similis populations collected from banana in different African countries (Cameroon, Uganda and the Ivory Coast) and one population from arecanut in Sri Lanka. In contrast, a population from tea in Sri Lanka and the population of Radopholus sp. from turmeric in Indonesia were the least fit. Specific pathogenicity was estimated at 8 weeks and 12 weeks after inoculation using three plant growth parameters: fresh root weight, fresh shoot weight and plant height, compared to uninfected control plants. Reduction in plant root weight was the best indicator of pathogenicity. While the R. similis populations from Uganda and the Ivory Coast were highly pathogenic, other populations with great reproductive fitness (i.e. isolates from Cameroon and Sri Lanka) did not significantly reduce root weight. In cv. Poyo, no linear correlation was found between final numbers of nematodes per gram of root (P-f) and the decrease of root weight.

AB  - Earthquakes result from fast slip that occurs along a fault surface. Interestingly, numerous dense geodetic observations over the last two decades indicate that such dynamic slip may start by a gradual unlocking of the fault surface and related progressive slip acceleration. This first slow stage is of great interest, because it could define an early indicator of a devastating earthquake. However, not all slow slip turns into fast slip, and sometimes it may simply stop. In this study, we use a numerical model based on the discrete element method to simulate crustal strike-slip faults of 50 km length that generate a wide variety of slip-modes, from stable-slip, to slow earthquakes, to fast earthquakes, all of which show similar characteristics to natural cases. The main goal of this work is to understand the conditions that allow slow events to turn into earthquakes, in contrast to those that cause slow earthquakes to stop. Our results suggest that fault surface geometry and related dilation/contraction patterns along strike play a key role. Slow earthquakes that initiate in large dilated regions bounded by neutral or low contracted domains, might turn into earthquakes. Slow events occurring in regions dominated by closely spaced, alternating, small magnitude dilational and contractional zones tend not to accelerate and may simply stop as isolated slow earthquakes.

AB  - The impact of climate factors on the epidemiology of diseases in general and leishmaniasis in particular continues to be a subject of research and analysis. Changes in climatic parameters contribute to the creation of ecological conditions favorable to the multiplication of the vectors of certain diseases. With this in mind, this study presents an entomological survey conducted in Meknes prefecture and the study of the link between the abundance of sandflies, an indicator of the risk of leishmaniasis in a given area, and the climatic factors. Monthly trapping of this fauna was carried out during a year from March 2016 until April 2017 using adhesive traps. Climatic data from the region were used to determine the effect of climate on the distribution of sandflies. A total of 941 leishmaniasis vector specimens were captured. The dominant species is Ph. sergenti (73.32), followed by Ph. longicuspis (8.25%), then Ph. perniciosus (7.94%) and Ph. papatasi (6.31%). The sex ratio study showed that males are more abundant than females for all species. The seasonal fluctuation is bimodal with two peaks, the first in July and the second in September. The results show a positive correlation between temperature and abundance of sandflies (r = 0.99) and a negative correlation with humidity and precipitation with a correlation coefficient of r = -0.87 and r = -0.72. Indeed, the medium-term climatological forecasts are essential tools to develop a warning system for leishmaniasis.

AB  - The present work aims at the geometric optimization, by means of constructal design and exhaustive search, of two rectangular fins inserted in a lid-driven cavity subjected to unsteady, incompressible, laminar, two-dimensional mixed convective flow with stable stratification. The main purpose is to maximize the dimensionless heat transfer rate ((q) over tilde') and time and spatial-averaged Nusselt number ((Nu(H)) over bar). The domain presents three constraints: cross-sectional areas for each fin and total area of the cavity. Two degrees of freedom are investigated, height/length ratios of the left and right rectangular fin (H-1/L-1 and H-2/L-2), considering three different fraction areas for fins and two different Richardson numbers Ri = 0.1 and 1.0, representing two conditions for mixed convective flow. All cases have constant Reynolds and Prandtl numbers (Re-H = 400 and Pr = 6.0). The conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy are solved using the Finite Volume Method. Recommendations for fins shapes were strongly affected by the performance indicators chosen. Results also indicated that asymmetric configurations for the fins with different fraction areas for each fin led to the best thermal performance. Moreover, the optimal shapes and the effect of degrees of freedom over performance indicators were also affected by the Richardson numbers investigated.

AB  - Najas minor and N. oguraensis (Hydrocharitaceae) are annual submerged plants and are difficult to distinguish owing to their similarities. While the number of anther locules and the size of the leaf epidermal cells differ between the two species, the anther locules are often difficult to observe on herbarium specimens and the effectiveness of using the size of the leaf epidermal cells as a taxonomic key character is currently unknown. We examined the size of the leaf epidermal cells in living plants and in dried specimens to evaluate the effectiveness of this feature in species identification. We first identified the two species by observing the anther locule number and then compared the size of the leaf cells in fixed and dried specimens. To identify plant fragments, we examined differences in epidermal cell length and width depending on the position of the cells within the plant. The length and width significantly differed in both fixed and dried leaves between the species. In particular, the epidermal cells of N. oguraensis (> 160 mu m) were about twice as long as those of N. minor regardless of leaf position. We therefore concluded that cell size, especially length, is a valid method for identifying the species in both fresh and dried condition. This method is effective where precise identifications are necessary, such as in floristic surveys and environmental assessments.

AB  - In this paper, we analyse how and why domestic forest policies in Europe have responded to pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation, climate and bioenergy policies. We use content analysis of documents and interviews to analyse change and stability in domestic forest policy goals, instruments and practices in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden over time. We find that decision-makers in forest policy and practice responded to pressure to integrate biodiversity into forestry through four different types of policy change outcomes and processes. Depending on the context, these responses included layering, drift, conversion and/or replacement. In all countries, the forest policy changes were driven by (partly shifting) coalitional politics and changes in external conditions. Domestic forest policy regimes shifted from 'timber production' towards 'multifunctional', 'sustainable forest management' or 'biodiversity' primacy, and then back to 'timber harvesting'. Forest policy also integrated bioenergy and climate change policies in order to minimise pressure by EU and national biodiversity policy sectors and to enable 'timber harvesting' (re-)turns in forest policy. We conclude that policy integration processes and the shifts in forest policy they contain refer to a sectoral resilience, that is, the ability of forest policy to react to, minimise, and absorb pressures to integrate biodiversity conservation policies.

Nonetheless, Lithuania wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the sustainability context have never been evaluated before. A comprehensive set of 30 sustainable development indicators (SDI) (9 functional, 11 environmental, 5 economical and 6 socio-cultural) in connection with functional unit were applied to medium-sized Jurbarkas WWTP (with a capacity of 2,540 m(3)/d). Sustainability evaluation involved life cycle of WWTP maintenance phase as well as water inlet, outlet and manufacturing. Results revealed that in the general context of sustainability the stability of plant varied greatly. Nine SDI haven't reached the sustainability approach. Graphically systemized results in the four sustainability categories have shown that relatively highest environmental impact regarding the maximum covered plot is caused due to an economical unsustainability. Operational and maintenance costs per volume of wastewater treated were approximately 2.23 higher than the cost to consumers per one cubic meter of wastewater treated, therefore depreciation, repairs, material costs and wastewater treatment costs accounted to 87%. Methodology by using SDI for estimating sustainability of WWTP is adaptable to different capacity or technology of WWTP, comparable, simple to develop and improve.

AB  - Batch cultures are frequently used in experimental evolution to study the dynamics of adaptation. Although they are generally considered to simply drive a growth rate increase, other fitness components can also be selected for. Indeed, recurrent batches form a seasonal environment where different phases repeat periodically and different traits can be under selection in the different seasons. Moreover, the system being closed, organisms may have a strong impact on the environment. Thus, the study of adaptation should take into account the environment and eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Using data from an experimental evolution on yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a mathematical model to understand which traits are under selection, and what is the impact of the environment for selection in a batch culture. We showed that two kinds of traits are under selection in seasonal environments: life-history traits, related to growth and mortality, but also transition traits, related to the ability to react to environmental changes. The impact of environmental conditions can be summarized by the length of the different seasons which weight selection on each trait: the longer a season is, the higher the selection on associated traits. Since phenotypes drive season length, eco-evolutionary feedbacks emerge. Our results show how evolution in successive batches can affect season lengths and strength of selection on different traits.

AB  - Coal combustion residuals (CCRs) contain variable amounts of trace metals, which can negatively impact the environment. We analyzed metal concentrations and leachability of CCRs from seven coal-fired power plants from Florida. The purpose of this study was to characterize and assess metal leachability in representative CCRs samples from coal-fired power plants, including As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Se. The specific objectives were to: (1) measure metal leachability under different pH conditions and liquid-to-solid ratios using USEPA Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) Methods 1313 and 1316, and (2) compare their leachability with those obtained by the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP). All metals excluding Cd showed amphoteric behavior, presenting higher concentrations at low and high pH using LEAF Method 1313. The highest Cd leaching was observed at pH 2-4 and decreased at pH > 7. SPLP results were highly variable when compared to the LEAF data. All metals except Ba exceeded the Florida Groundwater Cleanup Target Levels at all pH levels, however, metal leaching was low at typical soil pH of 4-9. Metal concentrations in fly ash decreased in most cases with increasing LS ratio. Therefore, due to potential leaching of some metals, evaluation is needed before beneficial use of CCRs.

AB  - Potato is an important nutrient source in human nutrition. Potato tuber quality is affected by a cultivar, environmental conditions and agricultural practices. The study examined the effect of dose (0.2 dm(3) ha(-1) and 0.4 dm(3) ha(-1)) and date of Tytanit (R) application (a single foliar application at the leaf development stage - BBCH 14-16 or at the tuber formation stage - BBCH 41-43, and a double foliar application at the BBCH 14-16 and BBCH 41-43 stages) on the tuber quality of very early potato cultivars (lord' and 'Milek'). Potatoes were harvested 75 days after planting (the end of June). Tytanit (R) (8.5 g Ti in 1 dm(3)) did not affect the content of dry matter, starch, monosaccharides, protein, L-ascorbic acid or nitrates in potato tubers. The very early potato cultivars responded differently to the Tytanit (R) applied. This growth stimulant caused an increase in total sugars content in the tubers of 'Milek' and had a greater effect on the discoloration of tuber flesh after cooking of this cultivar. The contents of dry matter, starch, total sugars and protein in 'Milek' tubers were higher than in 'Lord' tubers, while the content of monosaccharides, L-ascorbic acid and nitrates in tubers of both cultivars did not differ significantly.

AB  - Objectives: To study changes in the parameters of thromboelastometry and the plasma link of the hemostasis system in women with uncomplicated pregnancy and with manifestations of thrombophilia in the perinatal period.
   Methods: The analysis of indices of thromboelastometry and coagulogram in 408 women was conducted. The study was conducted from 8.09.2016 for 13.09.2016. The subjects were conventionally divided into groups: A - women without pathology of hemostasis (n = 152), B - women with clinical manifestations of thrombophilia (n = 256). The examination was carried out in the third trimester of pregnancy, on days 1 and 5 after delivery.
   Results: In patients with thrombophilia, significant changes in coagulation potentials, characterized by hypercoagulation, thrombinemia and a decrease in the reserve of natural anticoagulants, and a decrease in fibrinolysis activity were noted. Changes were observed in the prenatal period, increased in the first day after childbirth.
   Conclusion: The studied parameters of hemostasis can be used in assessing the risk of thrombotic complications and the rationale for antithrombotic therapy.
   The hemostatic system is one of the fundamental systems of the human body, which ensures the functioning of all organs. During pregnancy are hemostatic changes which are intended at maintaining normal functioning of the fetoplacental complex and stop bleeding from the vessels of the placental bed after the separation of the placenta. Moreover, in the course of gestation, the conditions for the development of a hypercoagulable state and complications of pregnancy.

AB  - To evaluate the impact of Cu, Zn and Pb on weed communities in urban environments, a field experiment was conducted in soils with high levels of single and multi-metal contamination in Shanghai, China. Soil properties, floristic composition, cover and biomass of the plant community and growth of different ecotypes was studied under contaminated soil as well as control conditions. Results showed that66 plant species belonging to 24 families were present in all plots, 31 species occurring only in spring and 8 in autumn, as well as 27 co-occurring in two seasons. Community composition was generally significantly different among treatments in spring and autumn. There was no significant difference in species richness or diversity between single-metal contamination and control. Presence of heavy metals dramatically impeded the growth of aboveground biomass as well as roots, and resulted in a significant decline in biomass of metal-sensitive species. Multi contamination (Cu + Zn + Pb) had a strong influence on weeds, as evidenced by a significant decline in species richness, cover and biomass of the community and in growth of metal-sensitive species. A large number of species were eliminated, while metal-tolerant species, mainly grasses, appeared in higher relative dominance in multi-contaminated sites. These findings give new insight for using weeds as a good indicator of complex metal-related stresses.

AB  - This study presents a comparison of the optimisation of building energy retrofit strategies from two different perspectives: an energy/economic-based analysis and an exergy/exergoeconomic-based analysis. A recently retrofitted community centre is used as a case study. ExRET-Opt, a novel building energy/exergy simulation tool with multi-objective optimisation capabilities based on NSGA-II is used to run both analysis. The first analysis, based on the 1st Law only, simultaneously optimises building energy use and design's Net Present Value (NPV). The second analysis, based on the 1st and the 2nd Laws, simultaneously optimises exergy destructions and the exergoeconomic cost-benefit index. Occupant thermal comfort is considered as a common objective function for both approaches. The aim is to assess the difference between the methods and calculate the performance among main indicators, considering the same decision variables and constraints. Outputs show that the inclusion of exergy/exergoeconomics as objective functions into the optimisation procedure has resulted in similar 1st Law and thermal comfort outputs, while providing solutions with less environmental impact under similar capital investments. This outputs demonstrate how the 1st Law is only a necessary calculation while the utilisation of the 1st and 2nd Laws becomes a sufficient condition for the analysis and design of low carbon buildings.

AB  - Nowadays, the accurate identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios play an important role in smart civil engineering, since they can be used for seismic design, vibration control, and condition assessment, among others. To achieve it in practical way, it is required to instrument the structure and apply techniques which are able to deal with noise-corrupted and non-linear signals, as they are common features in real-life civil structures. In this article, a two-step strategy is proposed for performing accurate modal parameters identification in an automated manner. In the first step, it is obtained and decomposed the measured signals using the natural excitation technique and the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform, respectively. Then, the second step estimates the modal parameters by solving an optimization problem employing a genetic algorithm-based approach, where the micropopulation concept is used to improve the speed convergence as well as the accuracy of the estimated values. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposal are tested using both the simulated response of a benchmark structure and the measurements of a real eight-story building. The obtained results show that the proposed strategy can estimate the modal parameters accurately, indicating than the proposal can be considered as an alternative to perform the abovementioned task.

AB  - Paleoredox indicators were used to assess the depositional environment of the Permian Irati Formation, and discuss the controls on the accumulation of organic-rich sediments. Geochemical data were measured for 43 drill-core samples in southern Parana Basin. We infer that redox boundary was located at the sediment-water interface during the accumulation of these sediments. Trace-element data demonstrate that Irati shales were similar to average shales, except during deposition of two organic-rich beds in which U and Mo are enriched, suggesting fully anoxic conditions. The variable degree of oxygenation of bottom waters is also attested by DOPT, Fe-T/Al, and sedimentological indicators of episodic ventilation. DOPT and Fe and S correlation points to an iron-limited environment, where the main sulfur sink is organic matter rather than pyrite. Cu and Cu/Mo ratio suggests bottom-water anoxia driven by increased organic flux. The Irati Formation was probably deposited in a salinity-stratified body of water, with positive water balance. The main control on the accumulation of the organic-rich sediments was the high organic carbon flux resultant from high primary productivity in surface waters. Anoxia arose as a consequence of increased productivity, not as the primary driver in the formation of these organic-rich rocks.

AB  - The management of the end-of-life (EoL) stage of a product directly affect the destination of EoL products. In the construction sector, EoL processes such as building deconstruction or conventional demolition commonly determine whether the material flows cycle is closed. In this context, increased knowledge on the EoL processes is considered vital for enabling stakeholders to make better informed decisions on each process. Pertinent parameters and key performance indicators may assist in this task, through the acquisition of relevant data that measure progress against targets. This paper focuses on EoL gypsum, a non-inert material appropriate for closed-loop recycling. In particular, a set of performance indicators are developed with the aim to increase the amount of gypsum waste capable of being recycled. At the same time, the production of quality recycled gypsum (RG) is prioritized. To this end, monitoring parameters were first defined and combined in the form of monitoring indicators. Such indicators were subsequently used in five pilot projects (from building deconstruction to production of recycled gypsum) set in four national contexts: Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. After data collection and analysis, 17 best practice indicators are identified out of the initial indicators, which recognize and encourage best practices associated to the recycling route, from a technical, environmental, social and economic perspective. The ideal conditions to produce RG from EoL gypsum are then formulated.

AB  - Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) product validation off the Western Iberian coast is here undertaken by directly comparing remote sensing data with in situ surface reference values. Both standard and recently developed alternative algorithms are considered for match-up data analysis. The investigated standard products are those produced by the MERIS (algal 1 and algal 2) and MODIS (OC3M) algorithms. The alternative data products include those generated within the CoastColour Project and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) funded by ESA, as well as a neural net model trained with field measurements collected in the Atlantic off Portugal (MLPATLP). Statistical analyses showed that satellite Chl estimates tend to be larger than in situ reference values. The study also revealed that a non-uniform Chl distribution in the water column can be a concurring factor to the documented overestimation tendency when considering larger optical depth match-up stations. Among standard remote sensing products, MODIS OC3M and MERIS algal 2 yield the best agreement with in situ data. The performance of MLPATLP highlights the capability of regional solutions to further improve Chl retrieval by accounting for environmental specificities. Results also demonstrate the relevance of oceanographic regions such as the Nazare area to evaluate how complex hydrodynamic conditions can influence the quality of Chl products.

AB  - Establishing new populations is essential for preventing the extinction of critically endangered plant species. However, defining the range of environmental conditions suitable for the most severely endangered species is challenging, since few wild populations remain for study. Experimental reintroductions of these species can achieve multiple conservation goals by improving our understanding of habitat and management requirements while simultaneously establishing new populations. We demonstrate this with Arenaria paludicola, a critically endangered wetland plant species now known from a single wild population in coastal California. Before transplanting, we tested salinity tolerance in the greenhouse, and found tolerance of a broader range of soils than expected based on the current distribution. We then transplanted A. paludicola in three different habitat types, with and without neighbor removal. Success of A. paludicola transplants differed dramatically between the three habitat types, indicating the importance of variation at the habitat and microhabitat level. The best practices for transplant management are context-dependent: neighbor removal may promote the growth of A. paludicola, but neighbors may also facilitate transplant establishment in unstable substrates. After one year, A. paludicola continued to thrive in habitats dominated by Oenanthe sarmentosa with open canopies and moist soil. This habitat differs from that of the remaining wild population. Our discovery of an additional habitat type suitable for A. paludicola will allow more effective selection of future transplant sites.

   Hintergrund: uber die Wirkung von Architektur und Design auf Patientinnen und Patienten psychiatrischer Einrichtungen existiert bisher kaum wissenschaftliche Evidenz.
   Methode: Es wurde eine systematische Literaturubersicht durchgefuhrt uber Studien in Einrichtungen der Erwachsenenpsychiatrie.
   Ergebnisse: 25 Publikationen wurden in die ubersicht eingeschlossen (vorwiegend Pra-Post- und Kontrollgruppen-Designs). Die Unterschiedsbedingungen reichten von Kunstinstallationen bis hin zu Komplettrenovierungen. Die uberwiegende Mehrheit der Studien zeigte positive Ergebnisse.
   Diskussion: Dieses Ergebnis sollte vor dem Hintergrund erheblicher methodischer Probleme vieler Studien interpretiert werden.
   Abstract
   Background: The physical environment of mental health institutions is regarded as a therapeutic agent within the treatment. There is only little scientific evidence on the consequences of architecture and design on psychiatric patients available.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted on studies from adult mental health institutions.
   Results: 25 studies were included into the review. Pre-post-studies and control group conditions were predominant study designs. Randomized controlled trials were not available. Interventions reached from art installations up to entire ward renovations. Outcome indicators were rather heterogeneous, including psychopathology, behavioural observations and aggression incidents. Overwhelmingly, the studies revealed positive results of interventions into the physical environment.
   Discussion and conclusions: We found positive outcomes independent from the intervention in detail. This result should be interpreted in the light of the generally low study quality and further methodological problems.

AB  - The high explosive nitroaromatic 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) is less shock sensitive than 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and is proposed as a TNT replacement for melt-cast formulations. Before using DNAN in munitions and potentially leading to environmental impact, the present study examines the ecotoxicity of DNAN using selected organisms. In water, DNAN decreased green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata growth (EC50= 4.0 mg/L), and bacteria Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence (Microtox, EC50 = 60.3 mg/L). In soil, DNAN decreased perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne growth (EC50= 7 mg/kg), and is lethal to earthworms Eisenia andrei (LC50 = 47 mg/kg). At sub-lethal concentrations, DNAN caused an avoidance response (EC50 = 31 mg/kg) by earthworms. The presence of DNAN and 2-amino-4-nitroanisole in earthworms and plants suggested a role of these compounds in DNAN toxicity. Toxicity of DNAN was compared to TNT, tested under the same experimental conditions. These analyses showed that DNAN was equally, or even less deleterious to organism health than TNT, depending on the species and toxicity test. The present studies provide baseline toxicity data to increase the understanding of the environmental impact of DNAN, and assist science-based decision makers for improved management of potential DNAN contaminated sites.

AB  - The production of maize doubled haploid (DH) lines is a technique commonly used by private companies, but not by Brazilian public institutions. Research on this technique is essential to develop and improve the production of DH lines grown under tropical conditions. We assessed the ability of a gynogenetic haploid inducer system to induce haploids in a tropical environment, assessed the induction rate of haploids identified using the R-navajo morphological marker, checked for interference from the generation of hybrid donors on haploid induction, measured the ability of flow cytometry, and simple sequence repeat marker techniques to identify doubled haploids. Seeds from the inducer Krasnodar Embryo Marker Synthetic (KEMS) line were sown in Ponta Grossa, PR, and Cravinhos, SP, and the plants were crossed to produce six hybrids and their F-2 generations. The seeds were separated according to the R-navajo morphological marker indicator of haploidy (purple endosperm and white embryo) and germinated in a controlled environment. Chromosomal duplication was performed in seedlings selected as putative haploids. We performed subsequent confirmation of ploidy and the success of duplication using flow cytometry and SSR marker techniques. We concluded that DH lines can be obtained from hybrids crossed with the inducer KEMS line. The generation of inbred hybrids did not affect the induction rate or chromosomal duplication in haploids. The use of flow cytometry and SSR markers was effective in verifying chromosomal duplication in haploids.

AB  - Pig slurry (PS) is widely used as a fertilizer for the production of maize in Spain. Field testing was carried Out over a ten-year period to compare the performance of maize fertilized with PS (45 m(3) ha(-1), equivalent to 315 kg nitrogen (N) ha(-1) year(-1)) (PS45) and mineral fertilizer (300 kg N ha(-1)) (N300) along with a N-free control (NO). Grain yield, biomass at physiological maturity, plant N uptake and soil nitrates (NO3--N) were measured as agronomic properties. Soil physical, chemical and biological parameters (as acid-phosphatase activity, earthworm abundance, CO2 Flux, Shannon H' diversity index (H'), number of utilized substrates (NUS), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), resistance to penetration (RP) and organic matter (OM) among others) were measured at harvest in the last two years of the experiment. The mineral fertilizer promoted the highest grain yield and N uptake by the plants, but also resulted in the highest residual NO3--N levels in the soil. Interestingly, most of the indicators revealed no statistically significant differences between the treatments in either test years, although a general trend was observed (NO < N300 < PS45). The repeated application of PS had a beneficial impact on the soil quality over time but did not improve grain yields. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - We used sedimentary records of Cladocera and chydorid (Chydoridae) ephippia to reconstruct Holocene climate trends from Lake Arapisto in southern Finland. The quantitative temperature record (T-JulyCla) inferred from subfossil Cladocera was compared with a previously published pollen-based mean annual temperature reconstruction (T-Ann) from the same lake. Furthermore, proportions of total chydorid ephippia (TCE), indicating proportions of asexual and sexual reproduction, were examined from the sediment core to provide supplementary data. The T-JulyCla record showed a consistent trend of slowly rising July temperatures (from 12-13 degrees C to similar to 15 degrees C) during the early Holocene until similar to 9500 cal. BP and indicated slightly higher temperatures than prior (similar to 16 degrees C) during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) at similar to 7000-4000 cal. BP. The TCE record was strongly similar to the T-JulyCla reconstruction during the Holocene. It suggested that chydorids would have reproduced predominantly sexually (higher TCE) under environmentally unfavorable periods (early Holocene) and some other occasions, and used mainly asexual reproduction mode under periods of stable environmental conditions (HTM). The monotony of the Cladocera-based reconstruction, when compared with the previously available pollen-based T-Ann record and other reference material from the adjacent region, suggests that it was partly hampered by other forcing factors more important than temperature, such as major food-web changes or adaptation ability of cladoceran species.

AB  - Palaemonetes australis is a euryhaline shrimp found in southwestern Australian estuaries. To determine if P. australis is a suitable bioindicator species for monitoring the health of estuarine biota, they were exposed to measured concentrations of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) at 0.01, 0.1, or 1 ppm for 14 days under laboratory conditions. At the end of exposure the shrimp were sacrificed for biomarker [ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD), 8-oxo-dG concentration, and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activity] analyses. Gender did not appear to influence biomarker responses of the shrimp in this study. ECOD activity was induced in the treatment groups in a linear fashion from three (0.01 ppm) times to 12 (1 ppm) times the negative controls. 8-oxo-dG concentration was reduced three times in treatment groups below the controls suggesting impaired DNA repair pathways. There was no increase in SDH, signifying hepatopancreatic cell damage had not occurred in any treatment group. The response of P. australis to B[a]P exposure indicates that this crustacean is suitable bioindicator species for both laboratory studies and field monitoring. A combination of ECOD and SDH activities and 8-oxo-dG concentration represent a suitable suite of biomarkers for environmental monitoring of the sublethal effects of organic pollution to crustaceans from an estuarine environment.

AB  - Blood is an indicator of physiological condition of an animal. Therefore, the chronic effects of propiconazole, a triazole fungicide present in aquatic environment, on hematology of rainbow trout were investigated in this study. Fish were exposed at various concentrations of PCZ (0.2, 50 and 500 mu g L(-1)) for 7, 20 and 30 d. Multiple biomarkers were measured, including hematological indices (hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells count, hematocrit, leukocyte count, mean erythrocyte hemoglobin, mean erythrocyte volume and mean color concentration) and plasma biochemical parameters (ammonia, glucose, total proteins, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase). Through principal component analysis and integrated biomarker response assessment, influence extent induced by PCZ-stress of each test group was distinguished. Additional, all parameters measured in this study displayed different dependent patterns to PCZ concentrations and exposure time by two-way ANOVA. The results of this study indicate that chronic exposure of PCZ has altered multiple physiological indices in fish hematology and CK activity may be an early biomarker of PCZ toxicity; however, before these parameters are used as special biomarkers for monitoring residual PCZ in aquatic environment, more detailed experiments in laboratory need to be performed in the future.

AB  - This study analyzes countries' sustainability conditions using panel data of genuine savings (GS) by calculating the average, trend, and stability of the countries' GS flow. We identify the pattern of GS changes in the past three decades on the basis of these three capital flow measures and the level of capital stock (wealth), and subsequently identify the factors that determine the GS change patterns. We find that the quality of institutional and population growth, along with natural resource abundance, substantially influences capital accumulation in the long term. In particular, our results indicate that only once does a good performance of GS not ensure sustainable development. For example, countries like Kenya performed well in terms of capital accumulation in the first period, but this performance was not maintained in the following period, as a result of the poor quality of institutions and governance. On the contrary, some countries, like Chile, where GS performance was poor in the beginning, eventually achieve a sustained pathway if they have good institutions and governance. In addition, we suggest that even countries in the best performing group for capital change are on an unsustainable path, which will eventually start decreasing in wealth. The exception is Norway, which is socially well developed, but has a lower population density and abundant natural resources. Our study proves that analyzing relevant indicators in the long term is crucial to understanding sustainability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Fruit-body production of mushrooms is not well understood to date as many factors interact with mushroom growth in nature. Weather conditions play a key role, but they do not completely explain the growth and productivity of wild mushrooms. Mycorrhizal fungi depend on photosynthetically fixed carbon produced by their associated trees, and the physiological state of host trees may well drive the growth of these fungi. We raise the question of whether mycorrhizal fungi can be used as indicators for tree health.
   Discussion In the 1980s, a decline in the species richness and abundance of ectomycorrhizal species was observed in Europe, which was then seen as reflecting the degree of forest dieback. An analysis of the results of a long-term study over 32 years in the fungus reserve La Chaneaz confirms this decline: since 1975, the mycorrhizal species have considerably decreased in abundance in relation to the other species. We discuss potential causes of this development and raise questions about a possible relationship between a decrease in mycorrhizal fungi and the health of the associated forest trees.
   Conclusion We do not yet know enough about forest mushrooms to be able to use them as bio-indicators of tree health. More research is needed, especially about the functional significance of ectomycorrhizal fungi on a species level.

AB  - Ontogenetic variation in 4 trace element (Sr-88, Ba-137, Mg-24, Na-23) concentrations and their ratios to Ca were measured in statoliths of the jumbo flying squid Dosidicus gigas off the Exclusive Economic Zone of Chilean and Peruvian waters using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The element compositions of statoliths showed no significant differences between females and males. All of the elements in different growth zones showed significant variations, except for Mg. Sr:Ca and Mg:Ca were good indicators for distinguishing squid from autumn and winter spawning seasons. Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca distribution patterns in statoliths confirmed that paralarvae and juvenile squid inhabit surface waters, while subadult squid migrate into deeper waters. An increasing Sr: Ca ratio of subadult squid could be explained by declining temperature gradients from northern to southern sampling locations, although no significant Sr: Ca differences were observed (p > 0.05). Mg:Ca ratios decreased progressively from the nucleus to the peripheral zone, which might be correlated with statolith growth rates. Na:Ca ratios slightly declined from paralarvae to the subadult phase. Quantitative relationships between statolith trace elements and environmental conditions under different growth stages are needed to improve our understanding of life history of D. gigas.

AB  - In Europe, the English yew species (Taxus baccata L.) is endangered. Intensive human land-use, including forest management, has caused a decrease of the yew populations all over Europe. In Austria, gene conservation forests are used for the in situ conservation of populations of this rare tree species by silvicultural treatments. In order to improve the conservation management in these gene conservation forests, this study addresses the relation between competition and viability of yew populations through the use of structural diversity indices. The structural indices, which include mingling, tree-tree distance, diameter, and tree height differentiation, were determined for a structural group of four trees as well as the neighbouring trees of the male and female yews at the monitoring plots on a regular grid in three gene conservation forests. Although the three study sites provided quite different environmental conditions for English yew, the vitality of each individual yew was influenced by the interspecific competition of the neighbouring tree species at all sites. Low vitality was associated with a small mean distance to neighbours and large tree height differentiation. In conclusion, we suggest that a combination of different structural indicators is needed for an integrative assessment of conservation status in the gene conservation forests. This would help improve the evaluation of the impact management has on yew population viability.

AB  - Objective: To assess the current status of protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in the high and low altitude preschool children aged 12-71 months.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted during the year of 2003 and involved 572 and 469 preschool children of Southwestern Saudi Arabia born and living permanently at high and low altitude areas. Anthropometric measurements were carried out to assess the prevalence of PEM using 3 indicators such as underweight, wasting and stunting following World Health Organization standards. Prevalence differences were examined by age, gender, altitude, and parental socioeconomic status.
   Results: The prevalence of the 3 types of PEM was significantly higher at low altitude than at high altitude and significantly higher among children born to illiterate than to educated parents. Older children were more underweight and stunted than younger children and underweight and wasting were significantly more common in boys than girls. Annual family income per person was negatively and significantly associated with underweight and stunting, but not with wasting. Multivariate analysis showed that after controlling for all sociobiological factors, low altitude remained a strong risk factor.
   Conclusions: The difference in PEM between high and low altitude preschool children could be related to the milder environmental conditions at high altitude and the higher incidence of tropical infections in lowland children. Future studies are required to verify these speculations, and to establish programs to control and prevent PEM in preschool children at low altitude.

AB  - Syncope is a commonly encountered problem in the emergency department (ED). Its causes are many and varied, some of which are potentially life threatening. A review was carried out of relevant papers in the available literature, and this article attempts to assimilate current evidence relating to ED management. While the cause of syncope can be identified in many patients, and life threatening conditions subsequently treated, a risk stratification approach should be taken for those in whom a cause is not identified in the ED. Aspects of the history and examination that may help identify high risk patients are explored and the role of investigations to aid this stratification is discussed. Identifying a cardiac cause for syncope is a poor prognostic indicator. Patients with unexplained syncope who have significant cardiac disease should therefore be investigated thoroughly to determine the nature of the underlying heart disease and the cause of syncope, although presently there is little evidence that this improves their dismal prognosis. This risk stratification approach has led to the development of several clinical decision rules, which are discussed along with current international guidelines on syncope management. This review suggests that presently the American College of Emergency Physicians guidelines are the most useful aids specific to the management of syncope in the ED; however, the Osservatorio Epidemiologico sulla Sincope nel Lazio ( OESIL) score may also be a useful ED risk stratification tool.

AB  - The comparative ecology of the three species of Polystichum in Hordaland, western Norway, has been studied. Species frequency data and environmental variables were recorded in 132 sample units from 10 different localities. The numerical methods used to analyse these data are two-way indicator species analysis, detrended correspondence analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and Gaussian legit regression. The main floristic gradient in the data is closely related to altitude. The second floristic gradient follows patterns in precipitation and soil pH. The ordination and classification results show that P. braunii is primarily a plant of deciduous forests, P. aculeatum occurs in open or woodland habitats near the coast, and P. lonchitis favours open habitats with cool summers at either low or high altitudes. The Gaussian legit regression results suggest that low altitude, short distance from the coast, and high soil pH may be important in influencing the growth of P. aculeatum, whereas P. braunii appears to depend most strongly on high soil depth and humidity and an adequate but not too extensive snow-cover in winter. P. lonchitis is found to favour high soil and air humidity, high light intensity, and not too high summer temperatures. The results contribute to our understanding of the local, national, and European distributions of the three species. In western Norway, conditions appear to be generally favourable for P. braunii and P. lonchitis, but are clearly less favourable for P. aculeatum.

AB  - This paper presents information on pedogenic processes, weathering status and geochemical evolution of ultramafic soils at three areas in southwestern British Columbia characterized by climatic conditions ranging from relatively wet-cool to relatively dry-cool. The soils of the Coquihalla serpentine belt have Podzolic profiles that resulted from intense weathering in a moist environment. The Tulameen area has a moderately dry climate, and Brunisolic soils have developed in serpentinized peridotite and dunite. Brunisolic soils with composite profiles of tephra overlying serpenite developed in a dry environment at the Shulaps area. We investigated the weathering- status of five soils using a variety of chemical and mineralogical techniques. Chlorite arid mica weathering was indicated by XRD analysis of clay fractions for the Podzolic soils at the Coquihalla area. Serpentine dissolution was also indicated by geochemical analysis of these upland soil profiles. Weathering and leaching depleted Mg from B horizons relative to parent materials. Chromium accumulated in B horizons of the soils, and was associated with high levels of Fe(d). The distribution of total and extractable Ni and Co indicated that these elements were transported to the C horizons in all but die driest environments. Redistribution of Mn also occurred, but to a lesser extent. The distribution patterns of Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni were useful indicators during the early stages of ultramafic pedogenesis.

AB  - Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of 4-androstene-3,17-dione to estrogen with the concomitant formation of the minor metabolites 4-androstene-19-hydroxy-3,17-dione (19-hydroxyandrostenedione) and 4-androstene-3,17,19-trione(19-oxoandrostenedione). Microsomes of chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human aromatase were isolated to investigate androstenedione metabolism. Relatively greater amounts of the minor metabolites result after limitation of electron flux from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to aromatase. Substitution of NADH for NADPH or limitation of NADPH availability increased minor metabolite formation relative to estrogen formation. Similar changes in metabolite ratios were observed when metabolism was conducted either at high pH (8.3) or in the presence of n-alcohols in the range of 5-200 mM alcohol concentrations. However, conditions of low pH (5.5) or high ionic strength (1 M KCl) resulted in minor changes in metabolite ratios, suggesting little or no effect on electron flux between NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and aromatase. Theoretical molar ratios of the resulting metabolites were predicted using a reaction scheme assuming sequential substrate oxidations without reversible intermediate release from the aromatase active site. This model was supported by a close agreement between theoretical and experimental metabolite ratios for a broad range of NADPH concentrations. The results indicate that metabolite ratios provide a sensitive indicator of aromatase-oxidoreductase interactions in the microsomal environment.

AB  - Water quality in the Vir Reservoir (the main water source in the Svratka watershed) and its tributaries was investigated in terms of the physico-chemical, biological and microbiological characteristics during 1988-1990. The results of investigation    showed that the Vir Reservoir in spite of its great depth (more than 60 m) and favourable morphology 30 years after impoundment has become more eutrophic. Long-term changes were characterized by log normal function which demonstrated the increase of the nitrate concentration from the level 5-10 mg.l-1 at the beginning of this period to the present concentrations, which are more than 20 mg.l-1 in the raw water to the drinking water treatment plant and also in the inflow water (the Svratka River in Dalecin). In a similar way there was an increase in average concentrations of PO43-. The main indicators of the accelerated eutrophication of the Vir reservoir  are the   occurrence of water blooms   of blue-green algae, the summer oxygen depletion and increased concentrations of Fe and Mn in the hypolimnion, while pH and dissolved oxygen increased in the epilimnion. The relationship between concentrations of nitrates and application rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizers in the watershed was highly significant. From this evaluation we drew the conclusion that the main cause of eutrophication is the increased input of nutrients from the watershed.

AB  - With the effects of global warming becoming ever more obvious, biodiversity conservation is facing severe challenges. Currently, a deeper understanding the mechanisms of the effects of warming on sensitive species has become an important topic in aquatic biodiversity and ecological management. Our study first overcame the "challenge" for a sensitive indicator species (Netzelia tuberspinifera, an endemic testate amoeba species in East Asia) of culturing under laboratory conditions, and then explored its molecular response mechanisms to warming using transcriptomic analysis. Our data indicate that temperature mainly drove the geographical and seasonal variation of N. tuberspinifera populations. Transcriptomic results indicate that when the temperature is <25 degrees C, rising temperature triggers the biosynthesis of ribosomes; while the temperature is >25 degrees C, it triggers molecular processes related with cell division, test formation and general biomass increase. However, once the temperature exceeds 40 degrees C, N. tuberspinifera is unable to survive. Following from these results, the distribution of N. tuberspinifera might expand towards higher altitude or latitude regions under global warming. For the first time, our study showed direct evidence for sensitive protozoa species that presents a very narrow adaptation mechanism to local climate. Our work provides fundamental data for regional biodiversity conservation and scientific reference in subtropical and tropical waterbodies. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ambient air pollution exerts deleterious effects on our environment. Continuously exposed to the atmosphere, diverse communities of microorganisms thrive on leaf surfaces, the phylloplane. The composition of these communities is dynamic, responding to many environmental factors including ambient air pollution. In this field study, over a 2 year period, we sampled Hedera helix (ivy) leaves at six locations exposed to different ambient air pollution conditions. Daily, we monitored ambient black carbon (BC), PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone concentrations and found that ambient air pollution led to a 2-7-fold BC increase on leaves, the phylloplane BC load. Our results further indicated that the phylloplane BC load correlates with the diversity of bacterial and fungal leaf communities, impacting diversity more than seasonal effects. The bacterial genera Novosphingobium, Hymenobacter, and Methylorubrum, and the fungal genus Ampelomyces were indicators for communities exposed to the highest phylloplane BC load. Parallel to this, we present one fungal and two bacterial phylloplane strains isolated from an air-polluted environment able to degrade benzene, toluene, and/or xylene, including a genomics-based description of the degradation pathways involved. The findings of this study suggest that ambient air pollution shapes microbial leaf communities, by affecting diversity and supporting members able to degrade airborne pollutants.</p>

AB  - Modelling future change to land use and land cover is done as part of many local and global scenario environmental assessments. Nevertheless, there are still considerable challenges related to simulating land-use responses to climate change. Mostly, climate change is considered by changing the temperature and precipitation, affecting the spatial distribution and productivity of future land use and land cover as result of differential changes in growing conditions. Other climate change effects, such as changes in the water resources needed to support future cropland expansion and intensification, are often neglected. In this study, we demonstrate how including different types of responses to climate change influences the simulation of future changes to land use and land cover, and land management. We study the influence of including different climate change effects in land system modeling step by step. The results show that land system models need to include numerous simultaneous climate change effects, particularly when looking at adaptation options such as implementing irrigation. Otherwise, there is a risk of biased impact estimates leading either to under- or overestimation of the consequences of land use change, including land degradation. Spatial land system models therefore need to be developed accounting for a multitude of climate change impacts, uncertainties related to climate data, and an assessment of the sensitivity of the outcomes toward the decisions of modellers on representing climate change impacts.

AB  - Forest soils respond dramatically to management changes compared to other soils influenced by different land-use forms. This work aimed to compare the soil conditions in four different zones in a temperate forest in a bio-sphere reserve in Mexico, using a minimum data set (MDS) based on volcanic soils properties to develop a soil quality index (SQI). For this purpose, two different MDSs were used, one obtained from an expert opinion and the other through a multivariate principal component analysis (PCA). The soil quality assessment was conducted in a biosphere reserve in Mexico, where volcanic soils predominate. Four different areas were studied. Overall, six different types of SQI were calculated for each area, for which linear and nonlinear functions were used and the additive and weighted method. The six SQI showed a significant difference between the four areas of study. The zone with the highest SQI values was the zone with a preserved pine forest, followed by the zone with a pine forest managed by the population, and the zones with a pine forest and grassland in recovery showed the lowest SQI. The linear score indices obtained by the PCA indicated the better ability to differentiate the calculated SQI values, which would provide information to contribute to the stakeholder management and decision making in the protection, conservation and management of the ecosystems present in the biosphere reserve.

AB  - Complex hydrodynamic conditions and the dynamic process of multi-habitats have brought challenges for the real-time management of novel wastewater treatment techniques. Thus, based on a well-performing membrane bioreactor with internal circulation, this paper presented an intelligent data mining work of performance prediction and the analysis of data influence for efficient management. The experimental data with 440 samples and nine internal environment parameters were integrated, and the concentrations of COD, NH4+-N and total nitrogen (TN) in the effluent were used as multiple performance indicators. Then, a comprehensive testing was utilized for recognizing the most robust model from the deep neural network, regression tree, random forest, adaptive boosting and gradient boosting regression (GBR), which included the evaluations of model fitting and generalization ability. Furthermore, the feature relative importance (Imp) and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to analyze the influence of data. The results indicated that the GBR model had a higher performance, in which, the R squared scores of 5-fold cross-validation were 0.847, 0.792 and 0.851 in predicting the concentration of COD, NH4+-N and TN, respectively. Besides, the quantification of Imp was accorded with the independent result of PCA, which indicated that the GBR model had well captured the dynamic information.

AB  - Envelope demodulation based on vibration data is widely used for the fault detection of rolling element bearing, which yet largely relies on the high signal to noise ratio of signal. In practical scenarios, because of the existence of various interfering components, it is necessary to estimate the fault-sensitive frequency band for feature enhancement. However, many of current approaches are likely to produce misleading results for that they are robust only for part of these interferences. Facing with this problem, an alternative method, named as ALKurtogram, is proposed by aligning the frequency division strategy of traditional fast kurtogram (FK) with a new indicator, the averaged local kurtosis (ALK). ALK measures both the local and overall impulsiveness of objective component, which intrinsically makes up for some drawbacks of previous methods under multi-interference condition for fault feature extraction. The inherent nature of ALK also allows it to be compatible with the time-varying speed, hence more widespread industrial applications can be achieved. Furthermore, a harmonic energy index (HEI) is defined by following the result of ALKurtogram to ascertain the order of principle component for bearing status recognition. The effectiveness and superiority of proposed method are validated experimentally by comparing with FK, the results prove that it is a powerful tool for reliable monitoring of bearing.

AB  - The booming development of e-commerce has brought about rapid growth in the express delivery industry in China. However, urban express distribution is increasingly difficult and seriously affecting the traffic, safety, and environmental conditions of cities due to small, scattered end points, unreasonable allocation of resources, and seriously repeated resource waste. Therefore, there is an urgent need to solve the problems associated with the unreasonable resource allocation of express distribution. In the context of green logistics, a new mode of collaborative distribution based on intelligent end service station (IESS) is proposed. Following the measurement models of carbon emissions, before and after collaborative distributions are provided to prove the environmental benefits of the new mode. The influencing factors considered in the models are the average daily distribution volume, number of distribution sections, vehicle ownership of various types, and their capacity, use, fuel, and power consumption. To verify the models' validity, we conduct an empirical study of five express enterprises in China and make a comparative analysis on the results, which show that the implementation of collaborative distribution can extremely reduce carbon emissions and improve the overall load rate of vehicles.

AB  - UNDP's 2030 agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasized gender equality in augmenting human capital and alleviating poverty. For eradication of extreme poverty and building resilience for persons who are vulnerable to poverty, SDGs calls for a pro-poor and gender-sensitive policy framework. In this context, a gender-based study on multi-dimensional aspects of poverty is highly significant. Extant literature reveals that females are more deprived in different dimensions of poverty such as education, health, living standard, empowerment, environment, autonomy and social relationship. The present study is conducted with the basic objective of examining feminization of poverty in rural areas of Jagatsinghapur district of Odisha. Seven socio-economic dimensions comprising sixteen indicators have been taken into consideration to construct the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) using the Alkire-Foster (AF) Method at the individual level. The novelty of the study lies in analyzing MPI at the individual level for rural Odisha. Higher female deprivation is observed across social groups and all occupation categories except services. Dummy variable regression analysis also supports the major findings of the study. Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function satisfies strict first-order stochastic dominance condition and substantiates the feminisation of poverty at each level of poverty cut-off across all social groups and occupational categories except for services. The findings of the study have significant implications for developing suitable policies for gender equalization and poverty alleviation.

AB  - Persimmons (Diospyros kaki) are trees cultivated under subtropical environmental conditions but are also found in other regions such as the Mediterranean. However, no research has been conducted to investigate soil erosion processes under Mediterranean soil management systems characterized by flood irrigation and/or tillage. The Improved Stock Unearthing Method (ISUM) for assessing long-term soil mobilization was applied to two fields, one under tillage and the other under no-till with herbicide within a 25-year old Mediterranean persimmon plantation. Replicating methods used in vineyard studies, graft unions on persimmon plants were used as passive bio-indicators of soil surface changes in this study. The tilled field showed a total soil mobilization volume of 48.4 m(3) on a 408.5 m(2) plot, representing a total soil loss of 52.6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). For the plot (468 m(2)) managed with no-till and herbicide, the results indicated total soil mobilization of 33.6 m(3) which translates to 31.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). It is concluded that flood irrigation is able to modify the runoff pathways and landforms in Mediterranean persimmon plantations, and the flood impact is more extensive when combined with tillage. For the first time, ISUM has been successfully applied to estimate soil erosion in a plantation under flood irrigation.

AB  - Stand-alone/grid connected renewable energy systems (RESs) require direct current (DC)/DC converters with continuous-input continuous-output current capabilities as maximum power point tracking (MPPT) converters. The continuous-input current feature minimizes the extracted power ripples while the continuous-output current offers non-pulsating power to the storage batteries/DC-link. CUK, D1 and D2 DC/DC converters are highly competitive candidates for this task especially because they share similar low-component count and functionality. Although these converters are of high resemblance, their performance assessment has not been previously compared. In this paper, a detailed comparison between the previously mentioned converters is carried out as several aspects should be addressed, mainly the converter tracking efficiency, conversion efficiency, inductor loss, system modelling, transient and steady-state performance. First, average model and dynamic analysis of the three converters are derived. Then, D1 and D2 small signal analysis in voltage-fed-mode is originated and compared to that of CUK in order to address the nature of converters' response to small system changes. Finally, the effect of converters' inductance variation on their performance is studied using rigorous simulation and experimental implementation under varying operating conditions. The assessment finally revels that D1 converter achieves the best overall efficiency with minimal inductor value.

AB  - Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) given to the right patient, in the right setting, in the right way and at the right time improves outcomes. However, national audits reveal poor practice in patient selection, clinical judgement, treatment initiation and availability of trained staff. NIV is indicated for persistent acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) with acidosis after usual medical management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and even without acidosis in neuromuscular disorders or other restrictive conditions eg obesity hypoventilation or kyphoscoliosis. Having trained staff in a suitable environment with adequate equipment are keys to its success, along with close monitoring. A plan should be put in place at the time of initiating NIV about the ceiling of care, eg escalation to intubation or palliation, if the patient is not improving with NIV. Early NIV failure is most likely due to technical issues, such as inadequate pressures or mask leak, while late failure is usually the consequence of advanced disease. Any presentation with AHRF is a poor prognostic indicator and outpatient respiratory follow-up is indicated following discharge. For selected patients with COPD who remain hypercapnic 2 weeks after an exacerbation, domiciliary NIV can reduce admissions and improve survival. For patients with neuromuscular disorders or kyphoscoliosis a presentation with AHRF almost always indicates the need for domiciliary NIV.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a critical role in climate-related biogeochemical cycles. The absorption spectrum slope of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the 275-295 nm spectral range (S275-295) have been previously used as indicators of the source, molecular weight, photobleaching, and fate of DOC in estuarine and coastal environments. Here, we developed a multiple regression algorithm using field measurements and near-concurrent satellite observations in estimating S275-295 from satellites in the West Florida Shelf (WFS). The algorithm had a reliable performance in estimating S275-295 in terms of mean relative error and root mean square error < 10%. The algorithm was applied to available daily satellite images to establish long-term time series of S275-295 dynamics and to investigate its driving factors. S275-295 exhibited substantial spatiotemporal variability on the WFS. Correlation analyses revealed that river discharge regulated the temporal and spatial variation of S275-295 on the inner shelf, however, only wind had significant influence on the spatial and temporal distribution of S275-295 on the outer shelf. Climate variations and weather conditions had significant influences on the temporal and spatial distribution of S275-295 on the shelf by influencing the river discharge and wind at short time-scale.

AB  - Unit process, open-water (UPOW) treatment wetlands are a unique type of constructed wetlands that are designed to promote photo- and microbiologically mediated natural water treatment processes. A mechanistic understanding of the removal processes for nitrate, trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), and microbial contaminants in UPOW wetlands has been established, and equations have been previously developed to describe removal kinetics. However, the numerical models developed to predict photodegradation rate constants for the removal of TrOC and microbial contaminants involve too many steps to facilitate a practical design approach. In this article, we present a method for predicting rates of phototransformation of representative TrOCs (atenolol, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine) and inactivation of microbial indicator organisms (Escherichia coli and MS2) that allows a user to readily design UPOW wetlands to meet different performance goals. Photodegradation rate constants were determined for a range of conditions that influence treatment efficacy (i.e., time of year, pH, latitude, and dissolved organic carbon concentration), and are presented in a series of figures. We illustrate the use of these figures for UPOW wetland design with a representative example of the design process. A spreadsheet containing sample calculations is included in the Supplementary Data.

AB  - This review explores two areas: firstly, the production of biochars from an array of different woody and non-woody waste biomass through pyrolysis and its physical-chemical characterization. Secondly, the influence of the structural properties of biochars for application in direct carbon fuel cells (DCFCs) is also explored. The need for developing low cost and environmentally favourable carbon fuel material puts lignocellulosic biomass-derived char (biochar) into the forefront. This char fuel is produced from biomass feedstock by the process of slow pyrolysis which is regarded as the most common route of production. The degree and magnitude of decomposition of each of the biomass components is dependent on process variables such as feedstock type, reaction temperature and heating rate. The generated biochar is then utilized as a fuel in a DCFC. This review establishes an understanding of the most significant properties of the biochar fuels which include proximate analysis (information of moisture, ash, volatile and fixed carbon content), and ultimate analysis (C, H, N, S and O composition), heating values and surface area. The H/C and the O/C atomic ratios are considered as important pyrolysis indicators required for a better quality fuel. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction. Fuel consumption by diesel locomotive during operation depends significantly on many factors, among which the main is the mode of driving a train. Purpose. Research on the mathematical model of the modes of driving a train on the site of Kharkiv-Merefa with the purpose of the main oscillograms of the operation of the locomotive on the site. Methodology. A mathematical model of the operation of the main units of the locomotive CHME3 in the Matlab environment was developed The model of the diesel engine is based on the calculated indicator diagram of its operation, which is approximated by a continuous dependence. The control panel operates on a system of conditions, the purpose of which is to maintain the set speed Results. In the course of the simulation, statistical data were obtained on the fuel consumption of the diesel locomotive when it operated on a section with a train of constant mass. Based on the data obtained, a three-dimensional surface is constructed showing the dependence of the fuel consumption on the time of the site's exploration and the maximum speed on the site. Practical value The dependence obtained can be used to optimize the driving behavior of trains along a section. The apparent dependence of fuel consumption on the driver's behavior is the basis for the further development of automatic locomotive speed control systems.

AB  - Autoantibodies of the IgG class against N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor subunit NR1 (NMDAR1) were first described in anti-NMDAR encephalitis and seen as disease indicators. Recent work on together over 5000 individuals challenged this exclusive view by showing age-dependently up to 420% NMDAR1-autoantibody seroprevalence with comparable immunoglobulin class and titer distribution across health and disease. The key question therefore is to understand the properties of these autoantibodies, also in healthy carriers, in order to assess secondary complications and possible contributions to neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we believe we provide for human NMDAR1-autoantibodies the first comprehensive analysis of their target epitopes and functionality. We selected sera of representative carriers, healthy or diagnosed with very diverse conditions, that is, schizophrenia, age-related disorders like hypertension and diabetes, or anti-NMDAR encephalitis. We show that all positive sera investigated, regardless of source (ill or healthy donor) and immunoglobulin class, provoked NMDAR1 internalization in human-induced pluripotent stem cellderived neurons and reduction of glutamate-evoked currents in NR1-1b/NR2A-expressing Xenopus oocytes. They displayed frequently polyclonal/polyspecific epitope recognition in the extracellular or intracellular NMDAR1 domains and some additionally in NR2A. We conclude that all circulating NMDAR1-autoantibodies have pathogenic potential regarding the whole spectrum of neuronal NMDAR-mediated effects upon access to the brain in situations of increased blood-brain-barrier permeability.

AB  - The management of dynamic and complex urban systems can no longer be driven by the sustainability aim alone and the concept of New Public Management is not more sufficient in conditions of financial constraints, growing needs, growing social awareness and expectations relating participation, citizenship, and public accountability. The general aim of the paper is to bring different concepts together to propose a new approach to investment decision making in urban development in order to support cities on both strategic and operational level. The rationalisation of investment decisions in the management of urban development requires acceptance of a new paradigm combining ideas of sustainable development and smart city, triad of creativity circularisation synergy, stakeholder theory; and social responsibility. The rationalisation requires also application of multi-criteria analysis which takes into account cross nature of investment in urban development. The proposed approach may be a theoretical reference for the subsequent methodological research and also managerial applications relating urban development projects. It can be then useful for public managers and provide support for decision making. The innovative approach of the research is not based on inventing new ideas from the scratch. It concerns application of already known concepts and theories which are necessary to create a new paradigm consistent with the known facts. The research is based on a critical literature review.

AB  - Meat derives from a muscle that undergoes a great number of biochemical and physiological changes. The anoxic condition established from the moment of animal sacrifice forces muscle cells to a sort of reaction, resulting in methodical programmed cell death to avoid necrosis. The duality autophagy and/or apoptosis is at the center of the scientific debate about the biological processes driving the muscle to meat conversion. Here we report an omic time course overview carried on proteome, phosphoproteome and metabolome of Piedmontese longissimus thoracis muscle searching for clues helping us to extricate through the dilemma. The survey depicts a progressive physiological impairing and our evidences push towards the apoptotic behavior: the proteomic time course trend of annexin A2, RKIP, HSPB6, alpha B crystalline, adenylate kinase, DJ-1 and 31 kDa actin fragment; the 0-1 day increased phosphorylation of myosin 2 and synaptopodin and the metabolomic time course trend of key metabolic indicators, like GSH/GSSG ratio, taurine and nitrotyrosine. The employed techniques provide strong indications about the likely apoptotic behavior of aging meat in muscle-to-meat conversion process.
   Biological significance
   Our work underlines compelling evidences of the apoptotic behavior of Piedmontese beef muscle cells undergoing the muscle-to-meat process, whereas no autophagic clues are inferred from this omic investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - On-line monitoring of insulation systems in power components such as power transformer bushings has significant value for their reliability. Dielectric spectroscopy is known as a powerful tool in condition assessment of power components' solid insulation. However, it is difficult to apply it on-line. Therefore, a new approach of intended use for on-line diagnosis of oil-impregnated paper, as a major insulation component of power transformers and bushings, is presented. In this technique, natural transients such as lightning and switching impulses are used as stimuli for on-line dielectric response measurements. The wide frequency range of these transients is their advantage as stimuli for dielectric spectroscopy. The influence of moisture content and temperature on the dielectric response of oil-impregnated paper has been investigated for performance evaluation of the proposed technique. It is shown that this technique can track the changes caused by moisture content and temperature in the dielectric response of oil-impregnated paper. The results of both low and high voltage study cases have been verified by comparison with Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS). According to the well-matched results with FDS, the proposed technique can offer a valuable approach for frequent monitoring of dielectric properties of oil-impregnated paper insulated systems such as those commonly encountered in power transformer bushings. However, the validity range of the results depends on the bandwidth of the applied transients and other discussed measurement considerations.

AB  - An approach to derive relationships for defining land degradation and desertification risk and developing appropriate tools for assessing the effectiveness of the various land management practices using indicators is presented in the present paper. In order to investigate which indicators are most effective in assessing the level of desertification risk, a total of 70 candidate indicators was selected providing information for the biophysical environment, socio-economic conditions, and land management characteristics. The indicators were defined in 1,672 field sites located in 17 study areas in the Mediterranean region, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Based on an existing geo-referenced database, classes were designated for each indicator and a sensitivity score to desertification was assigned to each class based on existing research. The obtained data were analyzed for the various processes of land degradation at farm level. The derived methodology was assessed using independent indicators, such as the measured soil erosion rate, and the organic matter content of the soil. Based on regression analyses, the collected indicator set can be reduced to a number of effective indicators ranging from 8 to 17 in the various processes of land degradation. Among the most important indicators identified as affecting land degradation and desertification risk were rain seasonality, slope gradient, plant cover, rate of land abandonment, land-use intensity, and the level of policy implementation.

AB  - Background Magnesium deficiency results in a loss of yield and quality of crop plants. Foliar application of magnesium is under discussion with regard to the amelioration of magnesium deficiency. We have tested the effect of magnesium foliar application on the leaf photosynthesis rate and on the transcript abundance of two enzymes that depend upon the supply of magnesium.
   Methods Vicia faba L. were grown under controlled environmental conditions in nutrient solution. Plants growing in low-magnesium solution were treated with foliar applications of 0, 50 or 200 mM MgSO4.
   Results and conclusions Photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll concentration increased following magnesium leaf application in magnesium-deficient plants but did not reach the levels of plants sufficiently supplied with magnesium via the roots. Under magnesium deficiency, foliar application had its greatest effect on magnesium concentration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration in older leaves but had only minor effects on younger leaves. However, foliar application increased the transcript levels of plasma-membrane ATPase in younger leaves but not in older leaves. The transcript levels of Mg-chelatase remained unchanged. The appearance of chlorosis is associated to aggravated loss of magnesium, in contrast a reduction in Mg chelatase transcript abundance is already measurable before the occurrence of visible symptoms as in the young leaves and might therefore represent a sensitive indicator of Mg deficiency.

AB  - The continuous provisioning of forest ecosystem goods and services (EGS) is of considerable interest to society. To provide insights on how much EGS provision will change with a changing climate and which factors will influence this change the most, we simulated forest stands on six climatically different sites in Central Europe under several scenarios of species diversity, management, and climate change. We evaluated the influence of these factors on the provision of a range of tree-based EGS, represented by harvested basal area, total biomass, stand diversity, and productivity. The most influential factor was species diversity, with diverse forest stands showing a lower sensitivity to climate change than monocultures. Management mainly influenced biomass, with the most intensively managed stands retaining more of their original biomass than others. All three climate-change scenarios yielded very similar results. We showed that (1) only few factor combinations perform worse under climate-change conditions than others, (2) diversity aspects are important for adaptive management measures, but for some indicators, management may be more important than diversity, and (3) at locations subject to increasing drought, the future provision of EGS may decrease regardless of the factor combination. This quantitative evaluation of the influence of different factors on changes in the provision of forest EGS with climate change represents an important step towards the design of more focused adaptation strategies and highlights key factors that should be considered in simulation studies under climate change.

AB  - This paper investigates the sick and healthy factors which contribute to heart disease for males and females. Association rule mining, a computational intelligence approach, is used to identify these factors and the UCI Cleveland dataset, a biological database, is considered along with the three rule generation algorithms - Apriori, Predictive Apriori and Tertius. Analyzing the information available on sick and healthy individuals and taking confidence as an indicator, females are seen to have less chance of coronary heart disease then males. Also, the attributes indicating healthy and sick conditions were identified. It is seen that factors such as chest pain being asymptomatic and the presence of exercise-induced angina indicate the likely existence of heart disease for both men and women. However, resting ECG being either normal or hyper and slope being flat are potential high risk factors for women only. For men, on the other hand, only a single rule expressing resting ECG being hyper was shown to be a significant factor. This means, for women, resting ECG status is a key distinct factor for heart disease prediction. Comparing the healthy status of men and women, slope being up, number of coloured vessels being zero, and old-peak being less than or equal to 0.56 indicate a healthy status for both genders.

AB  - Petrography together with rock and mineral chemistry of the appinite suite and associated lamprophyres in the Loch Lomond district of western Scotland assist in elucidating the nature of the parent magma and the evolutionary history of the rock types, and provide a basis for comparison with the appinite suite in its type locality (Appin district), also in the Scottish Caledonides. In both suites there are intrusions that are pipe-like and emplaced into subvolcanic pipes of explosion-breccia formed when structural traps were breached following the build up of gas pressure during magmatic crystallization. The Loch Lomond suite crystallized from a magma that was calc-alkaline, but with less alkalinity than the magma from which the Appin suite developed. The Ca contents of the clinopyroxenes in it are lower, Ca-rich plagioclase appeared earlier in its crystallization history and the gas pressure (PH2O < 1-4 kb) required to explosively breach the different structural traps was generally lower than that needed to breach many of the traps in the Appin district. However, similarities between the suites are much greater than differences and, in both, there is a comparable wide variety of rock types from ultramafic rocks to appinites with their abundant idiomorphic amphibole, kentallenite, diorites and minor granodiorite, but with pyroxene-mica diorite being the most abundant type in the Loch Lomond suite.

AB  - The current knowledge of microbial biocenoses (communities) in pristine aquifers is presented in a review, which also discusses their relevance for questions of groundwater protection. Aquifers are heterogeneous on all scales and structured in a variety of habitats. The void spaces in many aquifers are small. The biocenoses are thus predominantly composed of microorganisms and, often, microinvertebrates. Larger voids and macroorganisms occur in karst cavities. Due to the absence of light, the biocenoses depend on chemical energy resources, which are, however, scarce in non-contaminated groundwater. The microorganisms thus show small cell sizes, low population densities and reduced activity; they developed specific strategies to survive oligotrophic conditions. The review also discusses the impact of contamination on the biocenoses, and the potential use of the biocenoses or specific organisms as indicators for groundwater quality, and the limits of this approach. Bacteria are either planktonic or attached to aquifer material, which requires both fluid and solid phase sampling. Most groundwater bacteria are viable but non-culturable. Consequently, cultivation techniques give an incomplete picture of the biocenoses, while methods from molecular microbiology provide genetic fingerprints of the entire community. Different analytical methods are available to count microorganisms, identify species, characterise microbial diversity, and measure activity.

AB  - Introduction of alternative fuels in the passenger car fleet is widely discussed in the light of emission reductions. Worldwide experiences show that the market introduction depends on the actions of many stakeholders, like car industry, fuel companies and consumers. The process demands well-timed actions and investments, whilst economic chances and risks are distributed highly unequally. Policy makers set the framework conditions, although the influence of the height and timing of subsidies, tax reductions and other stimulation policies are not well understood yet.
   The market introduction of alternative fuel vehicles was studied with the example of natural gas cars in Switzerland. Stakeholder analysis and system dynamics modeling techniques were used to characterize the system. Analyses identify difficulties and chances in the market penetration process of natural gas cars. For example, a critical balance between fueling station upgrade investments and natural gas car sales is needed. Further, it is found that large time delays exist between strategic policy actions and frequently used market penetration indicators (e.g. car sales and infrastructure expansion), limiting the ability of policy makers to assess the performance of their strategy. Referring to elements of the Balanced Scorecard approach, a set of five alternative indicators is proposed to better measure the performance of the implemented strategy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of Pb2+ on growth, tetrapyrrole photosynthetic pigment content, total free porphyrin, and 5-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D) activity of a cyanobacterium, Microchaete tenera, and its ability to sequester Pb2+ from the culture medium were studied. Pb2+ was assayed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. M. tenera growth and chlorophyll a content were not affected by 0.5, 1.0, and 6.0 ppm of Pb2+. These treatments doubled the protein content and increased the phycobiliprotein content by four times after 7 days. The ALA-D activity decreased in all concentrations by 63% at day 7 and by 34% at day 14. As a consequence of ALA-D inhibition, total free porphyrin also decreased by 64% at day 7 and by 40% at day 14. The highest biomass lead uptake (7454 +/- 565 mug Pb2+/g dry weight) was observed at day 3 with 6.0 ppm of Pb2+ in the culture medium. Uptake coefficient was highest (3723 +/- 279 mug Pb2+ g (-) (1) dry weight/ppm of applied Pb2+ ) with 1.0 ppm after 3 days. The increase in protein and antenna pigments on day 7 was probably a response to stress conditions and could explain why the toxic metal did not affect growth. ALA-D inhibition and high lead biomass content confirm the importance of this enzyme as a biological indicator for stress. (C) 2001 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - This paper performs a detailed study of a wide set of organic-geochemical proxies in 15 sediment cores collected from the main basins of Lake Baikal (the northern, the central and the southern) where processes of focused fluid discharge were detected. A variety of studied zones includes sites with gas and hydrothermal seepage, mud volcanoes with or without gas-oil fluid discharge, gas hydrates and authigenic carbonates. The composition of the dispersed organic matter and individual hydrocarbon molecular markers (n-alkanes, dimethyl alkanes, isoprenoids, steranes, terpanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) testify to the input from predominantly allochthonous terrestrial and autochthonous microbial and algal sources. The studied sources, maturity and biodegradation parameters of organic matter vary significantly for areas with different fluid discharge. The composition of specific biomarkers including isoprenoids and immature hopanoids reflects the lateral and vertical changes of microbial activity in sediments associated with various environmental conditions. The identified types of terpanes distribution (mature, mixed and immature) correlate well with types of fluid discharge and attest to the development of various methanogenic and methanotrophic microbial communities in sediments. Moreover, the revealed specificity of microbial molecular markers distribution allowed us to suggest the fluid discharge processes in zones where they were not previously detected.

AB  - A detection system based on g-C3N4 nanosheets, copper ions and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) was developed for detection of coenzyme A ( CoA). By using chemically inert g-C3N4 nanosheets and oxOPD as fluorescent indicators, CoA formed a complex with Cu2+, which reduced the amount of free Cu2+ as an oxidant and quencher in the system, resulting in the OPD oxidation process being affected. Inhibition reduced the amount of oxOPD that was used as a quencher and a fluorescent indicator, resulting in the recovery of the fluorescence of g-C3N4 nanosheets, thereby changing the fluorescence intensity of the entire detection system. The ratio of the fluorescence emission intensity of g-C3N4 nanosheets to that of oxOPD (F440 / F560) was used as the response signal for proportional fluorescence detection. Under the optimized experimental conditions, this method had a good proportional fluorescence response toward the concentration of CoA from 1. 0 mu mol/L to 100. 0 mu mol/L. The linear regression equation was F440 / F560 = 0. 00502CCoA (mu mol/L) + 0. 1079 ( R2 = 0. 984). The detection limit (LOD = 3 S/m) was 0. 6 mu mol/L. The constructed detection system had good selectivity, and was used to detect CoA in human serum samples, which proved that the system had the potential for detection of CoA in complex biological matrices.

AB  - Dragonets are one of the dominant species in Tosa Bay, Southwestern Japan. However, until now, there is no baseline information on the conservation status of its species and populations. This study gathered genetic and ecological data and information to analyze and measure the historical conservation status of dragonets in the Bay. Quantitative values were converted into qualitative ranges to measures the conservation status of dragonet species. Eight dragonet species/populations were found to be in stable condition in the early 1990s, namely: Callionymus planus Ochiai, 1955; Callionymus lunatus Temminck and Schlegel, 1845; Callionymus curvicornis Valenciennes, 1837; Callionymus japonicus Houttuyn, 1782; Callionymus enneactis Bleeker, 1879; Synchiropus altivelis (Temminck and Schlegel, 1845); Repomucenus virgis (Jordan and Fowler, 1903); and Repomucenus huguenini Bleeker, 1858. Others were globally endangered and rare (Callionymus draconis Nakabo, 1977), locally highly vulnerable (Callionymus valenciennei Temminck and Schlegel, 1845; Callionymus beniteguri (Jordan and Snyder, 1900), locally vulnerable (Callionymus formosanus Fricke, 1981; Bathycallionymus kaianus (Gunther, 1981)), and globally highly vulnerable (Callionymus sokonumeri Kamohara, 1936). The information gained in this study provided baseline knowledge on the historical species risk status of dragonets in Tosa Bay, which can be used as a basis for future studies. It also provided some scientifically-based options for managing biodiversity in a defined spatial management unit, which is applicable to e.g., marine protected areas, parks, bays, islands, lakes, etc.

AB  - Grain size characteristics of sediments are an effective index for the depositional environment. However, whether grain size is an accurate indicator for the formation environment is still obscure. In this study, two main types of lithology can be found in the yardang sediments from the Loulan area (Lop Nur): sand-silt layers and clay-silt layers. These two types are common in arid northwestern China. The clay-silt layers were primarily composed of lacustrine-swamp deposits, whereas the sand silt layers were formed under fluvial conditions based on geomorphic and stratigraphic lithologic evidence. However, grain size characteristics of the sand-silt layers, such as grain size distribution, C-M diagram, and grain size parameters, were consistent with that of the aeolian deposits. The study of the field deposition environment indicated that the sand-silt layers were fluvial sediments of materials originating from the aeolian sediments transported over a short distance and deposited by floods. As a result, the fluvial sediments exhibited the grain size characteristics of aeolian sediments. This indicates that some sediments may retain different depositional environment information, having undergone transportation and deposition processes. Therefore, when using grain size characteristics to determine the depositional environment, field deposition environment investigation should be combined with other environmental proxy indicators.

AB  - This paper presents a hydraulic and morphological analysis of the Lower Jamuna in Bangladesh with a focus on two key bifurcations that are important for stabilization of the Lower Jamuna reach. We used ground measurements, historical data, multispectral satellite images from various sources as well as numerical models. We carried out hydraulic analyses of the changes and their peculiarities, such as flow distributions at the bifurcation and hysteresis of the stage-discharge relationships. We supplemented our analysis by using numerical models to simulate discharge distribution at the bifurcations under various flow and riverbed conditions. We developed an advanced and automated satellite image processing application for the Lower Jamuna, referred to as Morphology Monitor (MoMo), using the Google Earth Engine. MoMo was found to be an effective tool for a rapid assessment and analysis of the changes in deep-channel and sandbar areas. It is also useful for monitoring and assessing riverbank and char erosion and accretion, which is important not only for morphological but also ecological impact assessment. The application can be adapted as an operational tool as well. Furthermore, we assessed the evolution of deep channels at the bifurcations based on regularly and extensively measured bathymetry data. The analysis was carried out in complement with morphological modeling, particularly for short-term prediction. In this paper we present the major findings of the analysis and discuss their implications for adaptive river management.

AB  - Objective - The objective of this research was to identify correlations between the paravasal components connective tissue of the blood vessels of lungs and their morpho-functional parameters.
   Material and Methods - In order to determine the structure of the paravasal connective tissue, the histotopographic and histological examination of lung preparations of 20 men corpses of the first mature age period was held, to determine the capacity and capacitive characteristics of the vascular bed, the determination of the Kernogan index (IK) and the veno-arterial index (VAI) were carried out.
   Results - It was ascertained that in the structure of the paravasal connective tissue two layers could be conditionally distinguished - the "central" and "peripheral", differing in the architectonics of the fibrous component, the nature of interaction with nearby anatomical structures. It was also revealed that infrared venous vessels IK was expressed in a greater degree in comparison with arterial. When determining VAI vascular, the channel revealed that the area of venous vessels prevailed over the arterial area. Besides, the clear correlation relationships of the structural elements of the paravasal connective tissues were investigated with arterial and venous vessel capacity values and their capacitive characteristics.
   Conclusion - The presence of correlation relationships confirmed a clear interaction between structural organization of the paravasal connective tissue and the functional activity of the blood vessels, providing optimal hemodynamic conditions in the organ.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is widely acknowledged as a severe traumatic event, and depression, anxiety, and psychological distress are common in diagnosed patients. However, the correlations of biological indicators with emotion are rarely reported. The primary objective of this study was to explore the dysfunction of immune-inflammatory characteristics in patients with depression-anxiety symptoms.
   Methods: We investigated the mental status of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and compared the differences in cytokines and lymphocytes between patients with and without depression-anxiety symptoms at admission. After two weeks of treatment, we evaluated the mental conditions and measured the cytokines and lymphocytes of the patients with depression and anxiety symptoms and explored the changes and their associations.
   Results: Approximately half of the patients with COVID-19 had depression and anxiety symptoms, and the symptoms were related to the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ and the level of CD4(+) T lymphocytes. When compared with patients without depression-anxiety symptoms, CD4(+) T lymphocytes level was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with depression-anxiety symptoms.
   Conclusion: This study provided novel evidence regarding the association between depression and anxiety symptoms and immune characteristics, especially CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels, in COVID-19 patients. We emphasized the importance of paying attention to the dynamic immune process of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with depression/anxiety.

AB  - Photovoltaic systems represent a leading part of the market in the renewable energies sector. Contemporary technology offers possibilities to improve systems converting sun energy, especially for the efficiency of modules. The paper focuses on current concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) technologies, presenting data for solar cells and modules working under lab conditions as well as in a real environment. In this paper, we consider up-to-date solutions for two types of concentrating photovoltaic systems: high-concentration photovoltaics (HCPV) and low-concentration photovoltaics (LCPV). The current status of CPV solar modules was complemented by the preliminary results of new hybrid photovoltaic technology achieving records in efficiency. Compared to traditional Si-PV panels, CPV modules achieve greater conversion efficiency as a result of the concentrator optics applied. Specific CPV technologies were described in terms of efficiency, new approaches of a multijunction solar cell, a tracking system, and durability. The results of the analysis prove intensive development in the field of CPV modules and the potential of achieving record system efficiency. The paper also presents methods for the determination of the environmental impact of CPV during the entire life cycle by life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis and possible waste management scenarios. Environmental performance is generally assessed based on standard indicators, such as energy payback time, CO2 footprint, or GHG emission.

AB  - Theory suggests that a stressful working environment negatively affects workers' health. However, methodological limitations in observational studies often restrict conclusions about observed relationships. In this study, we examined cross-lagged effects of effort-reward imbalance (ERI; i.e., an indicator of work stress) and mental health (i.e., depressive symptoms) at the within-person level, while accounting for between-person variability. We used data from five panel waves gathered in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), comprising N = 5,778 (self-)employed individuals aged 50 years or older. Repeated measures for both ERI and depressive symptoms were modeled using random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling. The results showed no cross-lagged effects of ERI and depressive symptoms at the within-person level, but the intraindividual variations in ERI were positively related to the intra-individual variations in depressive symptoms at the same point in time. At the between-person level, it showed that individuals with generally higher levels of ERI tend to demonstrate generally higher levels of depressive symptoms. The findings question the notion that ERI and depressive symptoms influence each other over the course of time, but rather indicate that third variable effects account for observed relationships between these constructs.

AB  - The growing impact of organic and inorganic pollutants on the environment has led to the development of numerous strategies to counteract this effect. Among all, green technologies such as phytoremediation, has won relevance for its low cost as well as being an eco-friendly and sustainable process. In the past years, tobacco hairy roots (HRs) have become a good example of the effectiveness of plants as a tool for removing different pollutants. In this sense, the understanding of the intracellular mechanisms involved in the phytoremediation process has become of great interest. Glycerophospholipids (GLPs) are a key factor on intracellular signaling, given that they can activate different pathways, despite there is not enough information available about their levels and fluctuation under certain stress conditions. The aim of this work was to develop of a new chromatographic method coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and data dependent scan detection for the evaluation of GLP profile after the exposure to phenol, to get a better understanding of lipids turnover and their effect on signaling pathways. This highly sensitive method allows the identification, separation and quantification in less than a 20 min-run of the eleven most relevant GPL species present in hairy tobacco root extracts after phenol exposure, and is suitable for evaluating small changes in GPL levels.

AB  - Anthocyanins are natural colorants with excellent antioxidant, antimicrobial and pH-sensitive properties. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the development of active and intelligent packaging films based on biopolymers (e.g. polysaccharides and proteins) and anthocyanins from different plant sources. The structures of anthocyanins-rich films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometer. The physical properties of the films (e.g. color, thickness, moisture content, water solubility, barrier ability, mechanical properties and thermal stability) are influenced by anthocyanins. Moreover, anthocyanins-rich films exhibit excellent antioxidant, antimicrobial and pH-sensitive properties. In general, the structural, physical and functional properties of anthocyanins-rich films are closely related to the source, composition and content of anthocyanins, the type of biopolymers, and the film preparation and storage conditions. Till now, anthocyanins-rich films have been used to extend the shelf life of food (e.g. oil, cheese and fruits) and to monitor the freshness and quality of protein-rich food products (e.g. fish, shrimp, chicken, pork, milk and cheese). This review summarizes the recent advances in the preparation, structural characterization, physical and functional properties, and potential applications of anthocyanins-rich films in food smart packaging.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals have been categorized as emerging contaminants that may be hazardous to the environment. To assess their environmental risk, understanding their fate and behaviour is highly needed, particularly in soil where little is known. This study investigated sorption, degradation and mobility potential of ranitidine (RAN) from soil to groundwater in two soils with different physicochemical properties. Sorption resulted in data were found to fit well to isotherm models following the order: linear model > Freundlich > Langmuir with R-2 of up to 0.98. RAN showed low sorption affinity to soils with maximum adsorption coefficient (K-d) of 21.47 L kg(-1). Physicochemical properties for soil and RAN showed insignificant positive correlation to K-d values except the sand%, which showed significant negative correlation. Degradation of RAN was fitted to the first order exponential decay model with minimum DT50 (time for a 50% dissipation in RAN concentration) values of 31.6 d under non-sterile conditions. Prolonged DT50 of 62.4 d was obtained in soils from sterile treatments indicating the microbial activity role in dissipation of RAN process. To predict potential leaching of RAN in soil, this study experimentally obtained values of K-d, K-oc and DT50 were implemented in mathematical screening models. Results showed different but moderate leaching potential of RAN in soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Among the biggest threats to coastal water quality are freshwater discharges. It is difficult to predict the spatial extent of freshwater plumes at marine beaches because processes governing mass transport in the surf zone are complex. Participatory science approaches could facilitate collecting shoreline data, although volunteer sampling campaigns can be challenged by data quality and volunteer retention. The goals of this study were to (1) work with volunteers to estimate safe swimming distances at beaches that receive polluted discharges, and (2) test whether informational feedback to volunteers increased retention. Forty-six volunteers participated over 12 weeks in 2019 by collecting 1452 salinity measurements at beaches near the mouths of two Central California freshwater discharges and completing participation surveys. These measurements resulted in 145 distinct estimates of safe swimming distances (D-90), spanning a range of environmental conditions during rainy and dry periods. MedianD(90)s were 150 and 100 m at San Pedro Creek south and north, and 490 and 330 m at San Lorenzo River west and east, respectively.D(90)was significantly associated with adjacent freshwater discharge rate at both discharges and tide level at one discharge. On average, the odds of volunteers conducting sampling decreased by 4% (95% CI: 1%, 7%) with each successive week. A randomized intervention providing repeated data feedbackviaemail to volunteers did not affect their retention in the study.

AB  - Predicting the excretion of feces, urine and nitrogen (N) from dairy cows is an effective way to prevent and control the environmental pollution caused by scaled farming. The traditional prediction methods such as pollutant generation coefficient (PGC) and mathematical model based on linear regression (LR) may be limited by prediction range and regression function assumption, and sometimes may deviate from the actual condition. In order to solve these problems, the support vector regression (SVR) was applied for predicting the cows' feces, urine and N excretions, taking Holstein dry cows as a case study. SVR is a typical non-parametric machine learning model that does not require any specific assumptions about the regression function in advance and only by learning the training sample data, and also it can fit the function closest to the actual in most cases. To evaluate prediction accuracy effectively, the SVR technique was compared with the LR and radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF-ANN) methods, using the required sample data obtained from actual feeding experiments. The prediction results indicate that the proposed technique is superior to the other two conventional (especially LR) methods in predicting the main indicators of feces, urine, and N excretions of Holstein dry cows.

AB  - Bio-based sorbents are preferred over chemical-based methods for the dean-up of crude oil spills in marine environments because bio-based sorbents are more environmentally friendly. This study evaluates the use of peat-derived biochar (PB) as a bio-sorbent for the sorption and removal of crude oil spills from synthetic seawater. Experiments were designed to determine the effect of four operating factors (PB/crude oil contact time, PB dosage, oil dosage, and temperature) on two performance indicators (crude oil sorption capacity of PB, S, and oil removal efficiency, R%). Regression models containing linear, quadratic, and two-way interaction terms were developed to predict S and R% from the four factors. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to identify the optimum conditions for the sorption and removal of crude oil from seawater. The performance indicators were predicted with a high degree of accuracy, i.e. with coefficient of determination (R-2) values exceeding 90%. The optimum values of S and R% were estimated to be 32.5 g of crude oil/g of sorbent and 91.2% respectively. These optimum values were attained after 70 min of PB/crude oil contact time and at a temperature of 45 degrees C. The spent sorbent maintained its performance after three cycles of regeneration and reuse, suggesting that the material is reusable.

AB  - To date Indian summer monsoon (ISM) dynamics have been assessed by changes in stalagmite delta O-18. However, stalagmite delta O-18 is influenced by multiple environmental factors (e.g., atmospheric moisture transport, rainfall amount at the study site, and ISM seasonality), precluding simple and clear reconstructions of rainfall amount or variability. This study aims to disentangle these environmental factors by combining delta O-18, delta Ca-44, and elemental data from a stalagmite covering Termination II and the last interglacial from Mawmluh Cave, NE India, to produce a semiquantitative reconstruction of past ISM rainfall. We interpret delta O-18 as a mixed signal of rainfall source dynamics and rainfall amount and coupled delta Ca-44 and X/Ca ratios as indicators of local infiltration rate and prior calcite precipitation in the karst zone. The wettest conditions in our studied interval (135 and 100 kyrs BP; BP = before present, with the present being 1950 CE) occurred during Marine Isotope Stage 5e. Our multiproxy data set suggests a likely change in seasonal distribution of Marine Isotope Stage 5e rainfall compared to the Holocene; the wet season was longer with higher-than-modern dry season rainfall. Using the last interglacial as an analogue for future anthropogenic warming, our data suggest a more erratic ISM behavior in a warmer world.

AB  - Two or more spatio- temporally co-located meteorological/climatological extremes (co-occurring extremes) place far greater stress on human and ecological systems than any single extreme could. This was observed during the California drought of 2011-2015 where multiple years of negative precipitation anomalies occurred simultaneously with positive temperature anomalies resulting in California's worst drought on observational record. The large-scale drivers which modulate the occurrence of extremes in two or more variables remains largely unexplored. Using California wintertime (November-April) temperature and precipitation as a case study, we apply a novel, nonparametric conditional probability distribution method that allows for evaluation of complex, multivariate, and nonlinear relationships that exist among temperature, precipitation, and various indicators of large-scale climate variability and change. We find that multivariate variability and statistics of temperature and precipitation exhibit strong spatial variation across scales that are often treated as being homogeneous. Further, we demonstrate that the multivariate statistics of temperature and precipitation are highly non-stationary and therefore require more robust and sophisticated statistical techniques for accurate characterization. Of all the indicators of the large-scale climate conditions we studied, the dipole index explains the greatest fraction of multivariate variability in the co-occurrence of California wintertime extremes in temperature and precipitation.

AB  - Organic plant products offer numerous health benefits and it is essential to preserve soil productiveness without adding any synthetic chemical additives. Soil amendment materials particularly from organic sources are able to enhance the soil fertility for sustained environmental quality and plant productivity. Studies were conducted to investigate the effects of soil amendments (biochar and animal compost) on soil (cropped and non-cropped) properties (EC and pH), and on indicator plants (corn and cucumber) growth under organic farming system conditions. A greenhouse pot experiment was initiated in a randomized complete block design over the period of 8 weeks. The results showed that the cropped soil had significantly higher soil EC and lower pH compared to the non-cropped soil. The plant height, plant dry biomass and leaf chlorophyll content was also significantly higher in cropped soil compared to non-cropped. The biochar and compost amendments showed significant effects on soil EC, however they did not show any statistically significant differences for soil pH. Soil amended with compost exhibited a significant positive effect on plant height and leaf chlorophyll content, while biochar amended soil did not show significant effects on plant growth and chlorophyll content. Further studies on a range of soil properties are underway and will be discussed in detail. This study highlights the importance of studying the effects of organic amendments on soil properties and plant growth and comparing cropped and non-cropped soils.

AB  - Objectives: We draw upon theories of social disorganization, strain, and subculture of violence to examine how sex and race/ethnicity intersect to inform nonlethal violent offending at the macrolevel.
   Methods: Using neighborhood-level incidents, we examine (1) the structural correlates of male and female nonlethal violence and (2) whether ecological conditions have variable impacts on the prevalence of White, Black, and Latino male and female offenses above and beyond differential exposure to disadvantage. We use multivariate negative binomial regression within a structural equation modeling framework which allows for the examination of the same set of indicator variables on more than one dependent variable simultaneously while accounting for covariance between the dependent variables.
   Results: We find few significant differences in the salience of disadvantage on female and male violence across race and ethnicity although some differences emerge for White men and women. Structural factors are largely sex invariant within race and ethnicity.
   Conclusions: Despite expectations that disadvantage would have differential effects across sex and race/ethnicity, we uncover only minor differences. This suggests that structural effects are more invariant than variant across subgroups and highlights the importance of investigating both similarities and differences when examining neighborhood structure, intersectionality, and criminal behavior.

AB  - The Lesina lagoon (southern Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean) is a coastal lagoon located in a highly intensified farming and tourist area. A monthly sampling was carried out in 1998 in five stations, representative of different hydrological features, in order to analyse phytoplankton composition and its relation to environmental parameters. Our results showed high spatial variability of abiotic variables. Phytoplankton abundances and biomass trends showed marked seasonality, with annual peaks occurring in late winter-early spring and summer periods. Phytoplankton blooms were due to the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum cordatum. Statistical analyses showed that salinity and nutrients were the main factors affecting phytoplankton abundance and biomass. Phytoplankton dynamics was associated both to seasonality and the hydrodynamic regime of the system. Moreover, chemical-physical data were analysed together with those collected in the same stations in 2007, to compare their dynamics under different hydrological regimes. The two periods corresponded to the closure and opening, respectively, of canals connecting the lagoon to the sea. In general, abiotic variables (salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentrations) were significantly affected by the hydrodynamic regime. These data could provide a useful basis to complement the knowledge gained through current monitoring within the framework of the European Directives, as well as to implement conservation and management strategies of these transitional waters.

AB  - Glucose-induced microcalorimetry and carbon dioxide (CO2) production are two widely applied methods to assess microbial activity in soil. However, the links among them, microbial communities and soil chemical properties based on large number of soil samples are still not fully understood. Seventy-two soil samples of different land uses were collected from an ultisol soil area in south China. The best correlation between the rate of heat output and the rate of CO2 respiration occurred in 8-16 h reaction (R-2 = 0.64), followed by 0-8 h (R-2 = 0.50) (P < 0.001). However, the correlations decreased sharply after 16 h. The heat output per biomass unit (Q(T)/MBC) was well correlated with the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) (R-2 = 0.56) and bacterial PLFAs (R-2 = 0.53) (P < 0.001). In contrast, these links were not apparent between soil respiratory quotient (qCO(2)) and the total PLFAs and microbial communities. Redundancy analysis further confirmed that Q(T)/MBC was a more comprehensive indicator to assess soil microbial activity and soil quality than qCO(2), showing a good negative correlation to soil organic carbon, total nitrogen (N) and mineral N, and pH. This work is very helpful to better guide the application of calorimetry and CO2 respiration in assessing microbial activity in soils.

AB  - Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a rapidly growing, high-biomass crop prized for abiotic stress tolerance. However, measuring genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions remains a progress bottleneck. We subjected a panel of 30 genetically diverse sorghum genotypes to a spectrum of nitrogen deprivation and measured responses using high-throughput phenotyping technology followed by ionomic profiling. Responses were quantified using shape (16 measurable outputs), color (hue and intensity), and ionome (18 elements). We measured the speed at which specific genotypes respond to environmental conditions, in terms of both biomass and color changes, and identified individual genotypes that perform most favorably. With this analysis, we present a novel approach to quantifying color-based stress indicators over time. Additionally, ionomic profiling was conducted as an independent, low-cost, and high-throughput option for characterizing G x E, identifying the elements most affected by either genotype or treatment and suggesting signaling that occurs in response to the environment. This entire dataset and associated scripts are made available through an open-access, user-friendly, web-based interface. In summary, this work provides analysis tools for visualizing and quantifying plant abiotic stress responses over time. These methods can be deployed as a time-efficient method of dissecting the genetic mechanisms used by sorghum to respond to the environment to accelerate crop improvement.

AB  - In the Australian sub-tropics, seasonal changes in hydrology can influence abiotic conditions, and consequently, the biota. Several methods of macroinvertebrate analyses, including the use of taxonomic groupings, are used to ascertain information regarding stream biodiversity and health. The use of biological traits to group and analyse macroinvertebrate communities, however, may provide a better picture of stream health, particularly in ephemeral streams. To address whether this is the case, three ephemeral systems in the lower Fitzroy catchment, Central Queensland, Australia, were studied over an 18-month period. A total of 69 macroinvertebrate families from 14 orders were collected in 128 samples. Taxonomic analysis indicated there was a range of habitat preferences within groups characterized by a large proportion of tolerant and generalist taxa. The macroinvertebrate communities were categorised into biological trait groups, with a number of predator families found during all flow regimes. A general pattern of Gatherer > Predator > Grazer > Shredder > Filterer was observed. This study provides a clear pattern of the biological traits present during variable flow and could be used as a framework for future stream health modelling. A trait-specific management tool for assessing freshwaters has not yet been adopted in global management protocols and would require both a more definitive understanding of patterns during different flow periods and an internationally recognised set of trait nomenclature.

AB  - Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been well established as a method of choice for label-free kinetic measurements of biomolecular interactions. The conventional approach involves multiple injections of an analyte of different concentrations into a fluidic channel covered with a fixed ligand density. Optimization of the experimental conditions and assessment of the data quality can be complicated by issues such as disruption of the ligand structure by the regeneration step and the limited availability of the sample solution. By sequentially closing fluidic channels on a five-channel SPR instrument, different densities of a ligand can be immobilized and determined in one step. With a subsequent injection of a single sample solution, SPR sensorgrams can be simultaneously collected to yield binding and dissociation rate constants (k(a) and k(d)) and dissociation constant (K-D) between the ligand and analyte. For blomolecular interactions that obey the Langmuir isotherm, we show that the fidelity of the kinetic data can only be reliably confirmed when there exists a strong linear correlation between the SPR signals and the ligand densities. The use of a multichannel SPR instrument also obviates the regeneration step, allowing the binding kinetics between the green fluorescent protein and its antibody to be measured. In comparison to the conventional approach, the,method simplifies the experimental procedure, reduces costs associated with sensor chips and biological samples, expedites kinetic measurements, and allows affinity constants to be determined-more straightforwardly.

AB  - Accelerated degradation is the increased breakdown of a pesticide upon its repeated application, which has consequences for the environmental fate of pesticides. The herbicide atrazine was repeatedly applied to soils previously untreated with s-triazines for >5 years. A single application of atrazine, at an agriculturally relevant concentration, was sufficient to induce its rapid dissipation. Soils, with a range of physico-chemical properties and agricultural histories, showed similar degradation kinetics, with the half-life of atrazine decreasing from an average of 25 days after the first application to <2 days after the second. A mathematical model was developed to fit the atrazine-degrading kinetics, which incorporated the exponential growth of atrazine-degrading organisms. Despite the similar rates of degradation, the repertoire of atrazine-degrading genes varied between soils. Only a small portion of the bacterial community had the capacity for atrazine degradation. Overall, the microbial community was not significantly affected by atrazine treatment. One soil, characterised by low pH, did not exhibit accelerated degradation, and atrazine-degrading genes were not detected. Neutralisation of this soil restored accelerated degradation and the atrazine-degrading genes became detectable. This illustrates the potential for accelerated degradation to manifest when conditions become favourable. Additionally, the occurrence of accelerated degradation under agriculturally relevant concentrations supports the consideration of the phenomena in environmental risk assessments.

AB  - A colony PCR-based assay was developed to rapidly determine if a cyanobacterium of interest contains the requisite genetic material, the PHA synthase PhaC subunit, to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). The test is both high throughput and robust, owing to an extensive sequence analysis of cyanobacteria PHA synthases. The assay uses a single detection primer set and a single reaction condition across multiple cyanobacteria strains to produce an easily detectable positive result - amplification via PCR as evidenced by a band in electrophoresis. In order to demonstrate the potential of the presence of phaC as an indicator of a cyanobacteria's PHA accumulation capabilities, the ability to produce PHA was assessed for five cyanobacteria with a traditional in vivo PHA granule staining using an oxazine dye. The confirmed in vivo staining results were then compared to the PCR-based assay results and found to be in agreement. The colony PCR assay was capable of successfully detecting the phaC gene in all six of the diverse cyanobacteria tested which possessed the gene, while exhibiting no undesired product formation across the nine total cyanobacteria strains tested. The colony PCR quick prep provides sufficient usable DNA template such that this assay could be readily expanded to assess multiple genes of interest simultaneously. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aflatoxins (AFs) are carcinogenic and toxic secondary metabolites produced mainly by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. To monitor and regulate the AF contamination of crops, a sensitive and precise detection method for these toxigenic fungi in environments is necessary. We herein developed a novel visual detection method, the dichlorvos-ammonia (DV-AM) method, for identifying AF-producing fungi using DV and AM vapor on agar culture plates, in which DV inhibits the esterase in AF biosynthesis, causing the accumulation of anthraquinone precursors (versiconal hemiacetal acetate and versiconol acetate) of AFs in mycelia on the agar plate, followed by a change in the color of the colonies from light yellow to brilliant purple-red by the AM vapor treatment. We also investigated the appropriate culture conditions to increase the color intensity. It should be noted that other species producing the same precursors of AFs such as Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus versicolor could be discriminated from the Aspergillus section Flavi based on the differences of their phenotypes. The DV-AM method was also useful for the isolation of nonaflatoxigenic fungi showing no color change, for screening microorganisms that inhibit the AF production by fungi, and for the characterization of the fungi infecting corn kernels. Thus, the DV-AM method can provide a highly sensitive and visible indicator for the detection of aflatoxigenic fungi.

AB  - The simultaneous perception of multimodal information in the environment during voluntary movement is very important for effective reactions to the environment. Previous studies have found that voluntary movement affects the simultaneous perception of auditory and tactile stimuli. However, the results of these experiments are not completely consistent, and the differences may be attributable to methodological differences in the previous studies. In this study, we investigated the effect of voluntary movement on the simultaneous perception of auditory and tactile stimuli using a temporal order judgment task with voluntary movement, involuntary movement, and no movement. To eliminate the potential effect of stimulus predictability and the effect of spatial information associated with large-scale movement in the previous studies, we randomized the interval between the start of movement and the first stimulus, and used small-scale movement. As a result, the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) during voluntary movement shifted from the tactile stimulus being first during involuntary movement or no movement to the auditory stimulus being first. The just noticeable difference (JND), an indicator of temporal resolution, did not differ across the three conditions. These results indicate that voluntary movement itself affects the PSS in auditory tactile simultaneous perception, but it does not influence the JND. In the discussion of these results, we suggest that simultaneous perception may be affected by the efference copy.

AB  - Features of three marine ecosystems affected by the Tsushima (TWC), Kuroshio (KC), and Oyashio (OC) currents were analysed based on fishery, oceanographic, and climate datasets during 1955-2010. Principal component (PC) analysis for catches of 25 indicator species showed evident decadal variation patterns with a step change in the first principal component (PC1) in the late 1980s, indicating synchronies in the dominant variation mode across the ecosystems. Step changes were also detected in the mid-1970s in PC2 and PC3 in OC, and around 1970 in PCs in KC and TWC. These indicate that the most marked change across the ecosystems occurred in the late 1980s, corresponding to the late 1980s climate regime shift, but OC also responded strongly to the mid-1970s regime shift, indicating different responses to regime shifts. The generalized additive model showed the PCs associated largely with water temperature in each region as well as climate indices, indicating the importance of regional oceanographic conditions. Ecosystem indicators such as the mean trophic level showed similarities between TWC and KC but differences with OC, indicating that trophic structures in TWC and KC were largely dependent on the mid-trophic (small pelagic species) level, while on demersal species in OC.

AB  - Treatments based on electroporation (EP) induce the formation of pores in cell membranes due to the application of pulsed electric fields. We present experimental evidence of the existence of pH fronts emerging from both electrodes during treatments based on tissue EP, for conditions found in many studies, and that these fronts are immediate and substantial. pH fronts are indirectly measured through the evanescence time (ET), defined as the time required for the tissue buffer to neutralize them. The ET was measured through a pH indicator imaged at a series of time intervals using a four-cluster hard fuzzy-c-means algorithm to segment pixels corresponding to the pH indicator at every frame. The ET was calculated as the time during which the number of pixels was 10% of those in the initial frame. While in EP-based treatments such as reversible (ECT) and irreversible electroporation (IRE) the ET is very short (though enough to cause minor injuries) due to electric pulse characteristics and biological buffers present in the tissue, in gene electrotransfer (GET), ET is much longer, enough to denaturate plasmids and produce cell damage. When any of the electric pulse parameters is doubled or tripled the ET grows and, remarkably, when any of the pulse parameters in GET is halved, the ET drops significantly. Reducing pH fronts has relevant implications for GET treatment efficiency, due to a substantial reduction of plasmid damage and cell loss.

AB  - Seasonal change in the meso-sized copepod community structure in the central part of Tokyo Bay was investigated from January 2006 to December 2008. Three seasonal community groups were detected, and seasonal shifts of these communities are explained by life history characteristics of indicator species and seasonal changes in the hydrographical environment. In the winter-spring community, Acartia omorii and Centropages abdominalis dominate because of high growth rates at low temperature. A shift to the early summer community is caused by a diapause of Ce. abdominalis as resting eggs and an increase in the growth and egg-production rate of Pseudodiaptomus marinus at high temperature. A shift to the summer-fall community is caused by a diapause of A. omorii at hypoxic and high temperature conditions and an increase of Temora turbinata, Paracalanus parvus and other oceanic species by an enhancement of the estuary circulation. Then, the community returns to a winter-spring one by the recovery of A. omorii and Ce. abdominalis with low temperatures and oxygenation of bottom water and by the disappearance of oceanic warm-water species at low temperature. Seasonal community shifts occurred almost regularly, but the shift from a winter-spring community to an early summer one occurred 1 month early in 2007 when the water temperature was warmer than in other years.

AB  - Image segmentation is a crucial step in understanding the structure of porous materials, subsequent analyses being profoundly dependent upon segmentation accuracy. Computed tomography images of naturally occurring heterogeneous materials such as soils are particularly challenging to segment reliably, due to the prevalence of partial volume effects, noise, and other artefacts induced during the image acquisition process. As a result, boundaries between classes of objects, typically pore versus solid in the case of soil, are difficult to identify. Indicator kriging can address these problems in a robust fashion but the computational cost can be very great under some circumstances; this is particularly true under conditions that occur regularly in images of soil. The kriging window size parameter is decisive in obtaining a good quality result at reasonable cost, but is difficult to estimate for an image exhibiting significant heterogeneity. This work demonstrates that, allowing the kriging window size to adapt locally throughout the image provides a very efficient solution. Moreover, it is shown that this can be achieved using a conceptually simple mechanism that involves negligible extra processing cost. The adaptive-window indicator kriging method described in this study achieves easily an order of magnitude improvement in computational performance over a fixed size window implementation without sacrificing quality. In addition, it is shown that, by improving the locality of estimation, the new method is robust when applied to soil images. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The timing of larval release may greatly affect the survivorship and distribution of pelagic stages and reveal important aspects of life history tactics in marine invertebrates. Endogenous rhythms of breeding individuals and populations are valuable indicators of selected strategies because they are free of the neutral effect of stochastic environmental variation. The high-shore intertidal barnacle Chthamalus bisinuatus exhibits endogenous tidal and tidal amplitude rhythms in a way that larval release would more likely occur during fortnightly neap periods at high tide. Such timing would minimize larval loss due to stranding and promote larval retention close to shore. This fully explains temporal patterns in populations facing the open sea and inhabiting eutrophic areas. However, rhythmic activity breaks down to an irregular pattern in a population within the Sao Sebastiao Channel subjected to large variation of food supply around a mesotrophic average. Peaks of chl a concentration precede release events by 6 d, suggesting resource limitation for egg production within the channel. Also, extreme daily temperatures imposing mortality risk correlate to release rate just 1 d ahead, suggesting a terminal reproductive strategy. Oceanographic conditions apparently dictate whether barnacles follow a rhythmic trend of larval release supported by endogenous timing or, alternatively, respond to the stochastic variation of key environmental factors, resulting in an erratic temporal pattern.

AB  - Due to major shifts in the marine ecosystem, many seabirds in the NE Atlantic have experienced short-and long-term breeding failures and population changes. One such seabird is the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, the populations of which have declined in Norway at an annual rate of 2% over a similar to 30 yr period. Parallel to this decline, we found a significant decline in egg volume at 2 widely separated Norwegian colonies situated in different marine ecoregions, a decline that is unprecedented among auks. In birds, egg production is costly for the female and varies in response to the amount of energy available for reproduction. Whereas proximate factors determining egg size are largely unknown, food availability prior to egg-laying is considered important. Using generalised least-square models, we demonstrate that the declines in egg size were driven by inter-annual changes in abundances of capelin Mallotus villosus and early life stages of herring Clupea harengus and haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, all of which are important prey of Atlantic puffins in these colonies. Furthermore, changes in climatic variables, such as sea temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation, suggest that other prey may also have played a role in determining puffin egg size. The decline in egg size may reduce the quality of future breeders and hence have negative effects on puffin populations.

AB  - Spatial-temporal variation of Rotifera in an eutrophic reservoir in southern Brazil. We analyzed the spatial and temporal variation of rotifers in a small, shallow and eutrophic reservoir, with intense Cyanobacteria blooms, in seven sampling stations during 17 months (March/2002 to July/2003). Fifty-two taxa were identified, comprising 16 families. Brachionidae, Conochilidae, Synchaetidae, Lecanidae, Collothecidae, Trichocercidae, and Gastropodidae were the most commonly found. Collotheca sp. was abundant in the winter (dry period), while numbers of Conochilus coenobasis and Keratella cochlearis were low. The abundance of Brachionus mirus var. reductus, Filinia longiseta and Keratella lenzi peaked in the summer (rainy season), while for Kellicottia bostonensis, Ploesoma truncatum, Polyarthra remata, Polyarthra vulgaris and Ptygura sp., abundance was highest in the winter, mainly associated with atypical rainfall. Significant differences in the number of taxa and abundance of rotifers were observed during the sampling period. The canonical correspondence analysis explained 46% of the relationship between rotifer abundance and environmental variables, positively correlated with rainfall, nitrite, water temperature, organic nitrogen, nitrate and air temperature. Variations in rotifer abundance were observed a month after changes in the phytoplankton community. Taxa, such as Filinia longiseta, Keratella lenzi and Keratella cochlearis, showed a temporal variation similar to that of other eutrophic reservoirs, while the heterogeneous distribution pattern observed in most taxa could be due to the hydrodynamics of the recently built reservoir and the adverse climatic conditions.

AB  - Sciomyzid flies (Diptera) have potential as biological control agents of intermediate hosts of snail-borne trematode diseases and as bioindicators of habitat condition and quality (particularly hydrology and vegetation structure). Standard area sweep net sampling of these flies in a single vegetation zone across ten turloughs in summer 2004 highlighted the importance of vegetation structure (standing height and outstretched length) on the abundance and species richness of Sciomyzidae. A mark recapture study was initiated in the summer of 2005 with the aim of quantifying absolute populations at one site where sciomyzid abundance was particularly high (Cregaclare South, Co. Galway). The total abundance of Sciomyzidae at the site was estimated at 3512 flies over an area of 600 square metres. This density (6.08 flies per square metre) is considerably higher than densities previously reported in two studies of a sciomyzid species in the USA, but is in line with estimates from the 2004 wider study. Specific markings were used in the 2005 mark recapture study to monitor any adult fly movements within the habitat. Females in two out of the three univoltine species showed a positive correlation in the proportion of gravid individuals caught over time. Multivoltine species showed no such relationship. Additionally, multivariate procedures were used to investigate the effect of date of sampling and spatial position on sciomyzid assemblage composition.

AB  - The Dead Sea region holds the archives of a complex relationship between an ever-changing nature and ancient civilisations. Regional pollen diagrams show a Roman-Byzantine period standing out in the recent millennia by its wetter climate that allowed intensive arboriculture. During that period, the Dead Sea formed laminites that display mostly a seasonal character. A multidisciplinary study focused on two earthquakes, 31 BC and AD 363, recorded as seismites in the Ze'elim gully A unit III which has been well dated by radiocarbon in a previous study. The sampling of the sediment was done at an annual resolution starting from a few years before and finishing a decade after each earthquake. A clear drop in agricultural indicators (especially Oleo and cereals) is shown. These pollen indicators mostly reflect human activities in the Judean Hills and coastal oases. Agriculture was disturbed in large part of the rift valley where earthquake damage affected irrigation and access to the fields. It took 4 to 5 yr to resume agriculture to previous conditions. Earthquakes must be seen as contributors to factors damaging societies. If combined with other factors such as climatic aridification, disease epidemics and political upheaval, they may lead to civilisation collapse. (C) 2009 University of Washington.

AB  - In recent decades, European protected forest areas primarily dedicated to biodiversity conservation have been increasingly selected using standard criteria that refer to three guiding principles in conservation planning: sufficient representativeness, adequate spatial design and adequate site suitability. The way these criteria are currently used by land planners was assessed through a standardised questionnaire sent to representatives from 21 European countries involved in the COST E27 action, and compared to prescriptions from the scientific literature. Results show that only 26% of the 101 types of protected forest areas, distributed in nine different countries, have been selected on the basis of all three guiding principles. For many protected area networks, insufficient importance is given to spatial design and site conditions, with the result that long-term persistence of biodiversity is far from guaranteed. The use of quantitative objectives, operational targets and optimisation approaches is also infrequent, in spite of repeated commitments of European forest ministers (MCPFE) to establish coherent, comprehensive and representative forest conservation networks. Overall, the adoption of a more systematic approach in forest conservation planning seems to be hindered by a dearth of operational guidelines to assess spatial design and site suitability, by insufficient collaboration between biologists and land planners, and by a shortage of funding to establish conservation networks.

AB  - Pollen analysis was carried out on samples of surface sediments from various plant communities of mangrove systems in Yingluo Bay, Guangxi to examine the relationships between vegetation and present-day pollen. High percentages of mangrove types can be indicators of the mangrove vegetation in general, although some terrestrial pollen occur. The exact present-day pollen assemblages can define plant community boundaries on a fine scale, which greatly increases the accuracy in the reconstruction of past environments and sea levels. Several interacting factors determine the degree to which each plant community is reflected by the pollen assemblages. After drawing the scatter diagram and using correlation analysis, cluster analysis, and detrended correspondence analysis, we summarize two groups impacting on pollen abundance. One includes the parameters of plants, in which plant cover is significantly associated with pollen percentages for Rhizophora stylosa and Kandelia candel, plant percentage plays an important role in pollen abundance for Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Excoecaria agallocha, and tree breast diameter is for Avicennia marina by controlling plant percentage. The other group focuses mainly on the environmental conditions, of which soil types and salinity factors are displayed by the first axis of DCA (altitude); water table depth is shown by the second axis; and tidal hydrodynamics is indicated by the third axis according to the separated samples associated with the communities in each sampling square.

AB  - To evaluate the potentials of growth and nitrogen (N) fixation of genus Crotalaria used as green manure, interspecific differences in dry matter production, root nodule formation, and N uptake among several species were investigated in field and pot experiments at Osaka, Japan. C. juncea, C. spectabilis, C. pallida, and C. incana exhibited vigorous vegetative growth, expanding leaf area and branching, and they began to flower in mid-July to early August. C. juncea had a high dry weight and a great N content at early growing stage probably due to faster root nodule formation. On the other hand, C. pallida grew slowly at the early stage due to slower nodulation, but had a high N content at the late stage. Incorporation of each species provided a large amount of N necessary for the succeeding wheat crops. Several indicators for rapid decomposition of the plants, such as total C, N and lignin contents, were investigated, and the possible increases in N supply and growth inhibition by incorporation to wheat crops were discussed. N-absorbing activity of C. juncea grown under the excess N condition (70 gN m(-2)) was also evaluated. The proportion of fixed N to total N was less than 1%, and the C/N ratio was significantly lower than that in Z. mays, suggesting that this plant species could be also useful as a cleaning crop.

AB  - This study evaluated the potential for conversion of Class B to Class A biosolids with respect to salmonellae and fecal coliforms during solar drying in concrete lined drying beds. Anaerobically (8% solids) and aerobically (2% solids) digested Class B biosolids were pumped into field-scale drying beds, and microbial populations and environmental conditions were monitored. Numbers of fecal coliforms and salmonellae decreased as temperature and rate of desiccation increased. After 3 to 4 weeks, Class A requirements were achieved in both biosolids for the pathogens and the indicators. However, following rainfall events, significant increase in numbers was observed for both fecal coliforms and salmonellae. In laboratory studies, regrowth of fecal coliforms was observed in both biosolids and biosolid-amended soil, but the regrowth of salmonellae observed in the concrete-lined drying beds did not occur. These laboratory studies demonstrated that pathogens decreased in numbers when soil was amended with biosolids. Based on serotyping, the increased numbers of salmonellae seen in the concrete lined drying beds following rainfall events was most likely due to recolonization due to contamination from fecal matter introduced by animals and not from regrowth of salmonellae indigenous to biosolids. Overall, we conclude that the use of concrete-lined beds created a situation in which moisture added as rainfall accumulated in the beds, promoting the growth of fecal coliforms and salmonellae added from external sources.

AB  - Paleostress fields of the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic Pyeongan Supergroup that is distributed along the northeastern part of the Ogcheon Belt in South Korea were investigated using the calcite strain gauge (CSG) technique. Combining the results of this study with those of other studies investigating the relationship between twin strain, twin density and width, which are used as indicators of deformation conditions in the natural low-temperature deformation of limestone, it was estimated that calcite twins in the study area were probably formed at temperatures lower than 170 degrees C. From two samples, two different principal paleostress directions were inferred from calcite twins, while only one direction was inferred from two other samples. This result suggests that deformation occurred during two or more different tectonic events in the Pyeongan Supergroup during the Mesozoic era. The maximum shortening axis was oriented in two directions, northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast, respectively, which coincide well with the paleostress directions inferred from the stress inversion for many fault sets. Combining the results of the paleostress analysis from this and other studies, we hypothesize that the directions of the maximum shortening axis in the Pyeongan Supergroup changed from northeast-southwest during the pre-Daebo orogeny period (Late Triassic period) to northwest-southeast during the syn-Daebo orogeny period (Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous period) in the Mesozoic era.

AB  - Currently there are no reliable summary indicators of the economic and fiscal condition of states and localities. This deficiency has hampered the efforts of policy makers at the sub-national level to monitor changes in the economic environment and predict how those changes will impact the fiscal health of governments. This paper attempts to fill this analytical vacuum by providing summary indicators of economic and fiscal health for New York State. The models developed are based on the single-index methodology developed by Stock and Watson [(1991). A probability model of the coincident economic indicators. In K. Lahiri and G. H. Moore (eds.), Leading economic indicators: new approaches and forecasting records (pp. 63-85). New York: Cambridge University Press]. This approach allows us to date New York business cycles and compare local cyclical behavior with the nation as a whole. We develop a leading index of economic indicators which predicts future movements in the coincident indicator. The Stock and Watson approach is used to create a fiscal indicator which acts as a summary indicator of revenue performance for New York. In addition, we explore the ability of our economic indicator series to predict future changes in state revenues. We find that changes in the leading indicator series have significant predictive power in forecasting changes in our revenue index. (C) 2003 International Institute of Forecasters.

AB  - Attracting females is considered to be one of the main functions of bird song. Both the rate and complexity of male song are assumed to be reliable, quality-related cues that may be used by the female when choosing a mate. In this study of the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) on Svalbard, both these song parameters were considered as possible quality indicators for the female. Owing to the challenging environmental conditions in the High Arctic, a high degree of male effort is probably necessary to successfully raise the clutch. Male song rate and song complexity were therefore predicted to be correlated with early mating, male feeding rate during the female's incubation, male feeding rate during the nestling stage, and the number of fledglings produced. Although song length tended to be positively associated with the number of fledged young, the different song complexity parameters did not show any clear association with the onset of breeding, the male's food provisioning rate, and the number of fledglings. However, the song rate was significantly correlated with early mating, and there was a positive, although not significant, correlation between song rate and the rate at which older chicks were fed by the male. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that females might use male song rate to assess male quality and ability to participate in raising chicks.

KW  - FOODBORNE DISEASE
KW  - BACTERIA
AB  - Humans ingest large numbers of microbes daily. Food provides distinctly different physical and physiological conditions from drinking water. With high concentrations of carbohydrate, protein, and ionic strength, food is much closer to the human physiological state than drinking water, which is essentially devoid of nutrients and ionic strength. Accordingly, microbes that can multiply in humans and cause disease can grow in food, but do not multiply in drinking water. Virtually all food sources contain many thousand times more bacteria than drinking water. Therefore, based on both observed microbial content and the presence of large numbers of pathogens or their indicators in food, in this country food is more of a health risk to humans than drinking water. Compounding this disparity is the fact that much food is imported with limited control over the means of production. Naturally occurring bacteria (HPC or autochthonous flora) do not have virulence factors, making their numbers irrelevant to health risk except in the case of the most severely immunocompromised-a very defined population group. Consequently, public health regulations should not be directed to eliminating naturally occurring HPC, but should be focused toward controlling pathogens through measures such as sanitary crop systems in the steps from production (e.g., quality of irrigation and fertilization, animal feed lot sanitation) through storage to consumer preparation. Food possesses a far greater risk than drinking water, and government agencies should take this fact into account when writing regulations.

AB  - The behaviour of a laminated plate with given boundary temperatures and displacement constraints is optimized and the optimization problem is expressed in terms of lamination parameters. Because the thermal conductivity and structural properties of a laminate depend on the lamination parameters of the laminate, the analysis of the plate consists of solving a coupled-field problem. The strain energy, or certain displacements of the laminated plate due to given boundary temperatures and displacement boundary conditions, is optimized with respect to in-plane lamination parameters, and also buckling of the plate is considered. The buckling factors for thermal loading are expressed as a function of four in-plane and four bending lamination parameters, and the smallest factor is maximized with respect to these parameters. In addition to these thermal problems, the natural frequencies of the laminated plate are studied. Since transverse shear deformations are taken into account,the natural frequencies can be expressed as functions of two in-plane and four bending lamination parameters, with respect to which the lowest natural frequency of the plate is maximized. The lay-up for the laminate, corresponding to four optimal in-plane or bending lamination parameters, consists of three layers at most and can be determined using explicit equations. Explicit equations are derived for creating a lay-up having optimal bending lamination parameters.

AB  - Being both relatively tectonically stable and far from formerly glaciated regions, continental Australia is particularly well-suited for the study of sea-level evolution since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Late Glacial Stage. Sea-level data from such regions are valuable indicators of ice-volume equivalent sea level since the effects of glacio-hydro-isostatic terms is less significant for far-field sites though still not negligible. In this study, we review published sea-level observations and results of recently developed numerical models for several areas of coastal Australia and produce corresponding palaeogeographic maps of the results of our numerical models. The results suggest that the Australian continental shelf was largely exposed during the LGM and provide detailed predictions of the timing of inundation as a function of position. Temporal and spatial variation of sea level provide important constraints that can in turn be used to improve the accuracy of numerical models, and better determine important rheological response parameters for the mantle and environmental conditions during the Late Glacial. The palaeoshoreline data from the modeling performed in this study indicate several key locations for future palaeo-environmental studies of sea-level change. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Natural growth lines in the ossicles of echinoids have been used to estimate age, calculate growth curves, and infer population age-structure. However, few studies evaluate whether these bands are added annually-a critical assumption of the aging technique. We tested whether the banding pattern is annual in Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. Sea urchins were tagged with a fluorescent marker, released into tidepools, and collected 1 year later. We quantified the position of the fluorescent mark relative to subsequent growth bands. In 30 individuals ranging in test diameter from 14 to 77 mm, and in a series of similar to2 mm size intervals, we examined 3 interambulacral plates (aboral, ambital, and oral) and a rotula from Aristotle's lantern. Overall, only 7 sea urchins (23%) added a complete band to all 4 ossicles. In 6 sea urchins (20%) at least 1 ossicle added more than 1 complete band. In many sea urchins, especially those >55 mm in diameter, most ossicles added less than 1 band. The banding pattern in ossicles seriously underestimates age in S. droebachiensis and population parameters inferred from these growth lines are biased. Before using the growth-band aging method in other echinoids, it must be demonstrated that 1 band is added annually for all sizes in a population under field conditions.

AB  - Sorbitol fermenting bifidobacteria were evaluated as indicators of non-point source human faecal pollution to three sub-estuaries with elevated faecal coliform densities. Human-specific bifidobacteria correlated with identifiable human sanitary deficiencies in feeder streams to estuarine creeks in two of three watersheds examined, one rural and one moderately developed. Sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria were recovered at densities ranging from 1 to 90 colony-forming-units 100 ml(-1) in 11 of 258 water samples but were undetected in sediment (n = 68) and scat from resident wildlife (deer, muskrat and raccoon, n = 20). Failure to detect sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria in water samples during the summer months was consistent with laboratory microcosm results showing non-recoverability of Bifidobacterium adolescentis after 5-9 d in membrane-filtered estuarine water at 23 and 30 degrees C, but persistence for 4 weeks at 10 degrees C. Persistence of sewage-derived bifidobacteria in membrane-filtered freshwater at 15 degrees C was also observed. Recovery of sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria was complicated by high background levels of Gram-positive rods and cocci. Use of propionic acid and reduced pH (pH = 5.0), or use of a two-step resuscitation protocol using non-selective and selective media, did not improve recovery. Although human specific bifidobacteria hold promise as indicators of diffuse faecal contamination, methodological constraints now limit its application to situations of gross contamination, or sampling potential sources during environmental conditions conducive to bifid persistence.

AB  - This study is aimed at evaluating the probiotic potential of three Enterococcus faecium strains (called 29-P2, 168-P6 and 277-S3) isolated from 'pastirma', a Turkish traditional dry-cured meat product. For this, key probiotic properties and some functional characteristics of strains were tested in vitro. Antimicrobial activity of 3 E. faecium strains was evaluated against 18 indicator microorganisms consisting of 13 foodborne pathogens and 5 lactic acid bacteria and all strains were found as the producer of antimicrobial substance. Especially one strain 168-P6 showed a remarkable activity spectrum and inhibited all of the used foodborne pathogen indicators. Antimicrobial compounds produced by strains were identified by determining the effect of enzyme, pH and temperature on antimicrobial activity. All strains exhibited tolerance to acidic conditions and a simulated gastric environment. Also, strains exhibited high adhesion capacity. The safety of the strains was assessed by determining hemolytic activity and the resistance to 14 different antibiotics. None of the three strains exhibited hemolytic activity, also strains were found reliable in terms of clinically relevant antibiotics, only one strain 29-P2 was found resistant to vancomycin. In addition, metabolic activities of strains including lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, exopolysaccharide production and proteolytic activity were determined and amounts of all metabolic products were found low. When evaluated all data obtained, it is believed that the strains have enviable characteristics as a probiotic candidate.

AB  - Raised bogs as huge carbon stocks are of worldwide importance, but they have been severely decreased and degraded globally. To stop this development, restoration measures are being carried out in many countries. The recovery of raised bogs is, however, slow and the success of restoration projects is uncertain. Long-term monitoring is thus needed. The Hagenmoos raised bog in the Swiss Plateau was restored by logging within former peat-cutting pits and by blocking drainage pathways. The vegetation in the bog was recorded 3 times within 72 permanent plots: immediately before, 10 years after and 30 years after restoration. Based on these vegetation surveys, changes in habitat conditions (ecological indicator values) and in species richness and single species were analysed. Overall, the restoration measures proved to be successful. Mean indicator values for light and moisture both increased over time. The increase of these indicators was strongest during the first 10 years after restoration and weakened afterwards. Within former peat-cutting pits, both indicator values reached values from a reference dataset composed of 21 plots from Swiss raised bogs representing typical bog communities. However, 30 years after restoration, mean light and moisture indicator values were still significantly lower outside former peat-cutting pits than within them, indicating a need for further restoration measures.

AB  - The shelf-life of live oysters is a quality-concerned issue along with the supply chain of the products. In present study, mass spectrometry-based peptidomics has been employed to investigate changes of endogenous peptides of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) occurred during anhydrous preservation with the purpose of discovering shelf-life indicators of live oysters. Samples of Crassostrea gigas harvested freshly were acclimated to laboratory environment first and then put under defined anhydrous preservation conditions (being packaged in sterile plastic bags and stored at 4 +/- 1 degrees C in low-temperature incubators). After regular intervals, samples were randomly collected for peptidomics analysis using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and potential peptide markers were mined by chemometric tools and verified by a multi-reaction monitoring method with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Approximately 8526 peptides, in total, were characterized and 4 endogenous peptides, SSSTGEVGTYSGTTN, TARNEANVNI, VGIIKGSSSEEA, and TARNEANVNIY, were finally proposed as potential markers for shelf-life evaluating. The proposed markers were applied to real-life samples and expected trends of the markers during anhydrous preservation were observed, implying applicability of the endogenous peptides for shelf-life evaluating. The findings of this study provide favorable evidences of mass spectrometry-based peptidomics in quality assessing for aquaculture products.

AB  - Shrubs create heterogeneity in resource availability, yet the influences of shrub age and size on these conditions in semiarid ecosystems is largely unknown. In order to inform restoration and conservation efforts in global shrub-steppe ecosystems that are currently imperiled, we assessed plant age-size relationships within an Artemisia tridentata stand in southern Idaho, USA, and examined the dependence of 2 resources, soil water content (SWC) and light at the soil surface (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]), on size of individual plants in understory and interspace microsites. Results included a positive relationship between shrub age and size, a median shrub age of 19 years old, and shrub sizes that varied by more than 3 orders of magnitude (i.e., 0.001 m(3) to 1 m(3)). Across this broad range in stand structure, PAR was significantly lower in understory than in interspace microsites, and it declined slightly with increasing shrub volume. Similarly, SWC declined faintly with shrub volume, but understory and interspace microsites did not differ. These findings indicate that resource heterogeneity created by shrubs is potentially dependent on shrub size within this ecosystem, and that variation in stand structure directly influenced resource heterogeneity between understory and interspace microsites. We suggest that routine monitoring of heterogeneity in stand structure could serve as a valuable indicator to assess site suitability for restoration activities and to make quantitative comparisons among sites to prioritize conservation efforts.

AB  - This study presents the updated version of the recently published LANDUM model [Land Use Policy 48, 38-50 (2015)]. LANDUM is integrated into the 100 m resolution RUSLE-based pan-European soil erosion risk modelling platform of the European Commission. It estimates the effects of local land use and management practices on the magnitude of soil erosion across each NUTS2 region of the European Union. This is done based on a spatially explicit estimation of the so-called cover-management factor of (R)USLE family models which is also known as C-factor. In this updated version, the data on soil conservation measures (i.e., reduced tillage, cover crops and plant residues) reported in the latest EU Farm Structure Survey (2016) were integrated and elaborated in LANDUM in order to estimate the changes of the C-factor in Europe between 2010 and 2016. For 2016, a C-factor of 0.2316 for the arable land of the 28 Member States of the European Union was estimated. This implies an overall decrease of C-factor of ca. -0.84 % compared to the 2010 survey. The change in C-factor from 2010 to 2016 could be an indication for the effectiveness of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) soil conservation measures in reducing soil erosion in Europe, especially key CAP policies such as Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions and Greening.

AB  - Predictability is an intrinsic limit of the climate system due to uncertainty in initial conditions and the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Estimates of predictability together with calculations of current prediction skill are used to define the gaps in our prediction capabilities, inform future model developments, and indicate to stakeholders the potential for making forecasts that can inform their decisions. The true predictability of the climate system is not known and must be estimated, typically using a perfect model estimate from an ensemble prediction system. However, different prediction systems can give different estimates of predictability. Can we determine which estimate of predictability is most representative of the true predictability of the climate system? We test three metrics as potential indicators of the fidelity of predictability estimates in an idealized framework-the spread-error relationship, autocorrelation and skill. Using the North American multi-model ensemble re-forecast database, we quantify whether these metrics accurately indicate a model's ability to properly estimate predictability. It is found that none of these metrics is a robust measure for determining whether a predictability estimate is realistic for El Nino-Southern oscillation events. For temperature and precipitation over land, errors in the spread-error ratio are related to errors in estimating predictability at the shortest lead-times, while skill is not related to predictability errors. The relationship between errors in the autocorrelation and errors in estimating predictability varies by lead-time and region.

AB  - Evidence of the impacts of land-use change on soil biological activities, a determinant of nutrient cycling in soil, will provide a better understanding of soil health and productivity. The study investigates temporal changes in soil chemical and microbial properties in a forest converted to oil palm plantation. Soil samples from four locations: native forest and Elaeis guineensis plantations of 2-, 13- and 14-year were collected. Total carbon C and N were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the native forest (NF) followed by 14- and 13-year E. guineensis plantations respectively. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) in NF were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the E. guineensis plantations. There were no significant differences in the microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) among the E. guineensis plantation of all ages. The qCO(2) in the 13- and 14-year E. guineensis plantations was higher than in NF and 2-year E. guineensis plantation. There was a positive correlation between MBC, MBN, MBP and pH, P, TC, and TN. These results indicated that conversion of native forest to E. guineensis plantation affected soil nutrient and microbial properties. And there could be a return to healthy soil condition as age of E. guineensis plantation increased.

AB  - Robust ecological assessments are fundamental for effective wildlife conservation. Owing to the high legal protection of bats, surveys are frequently required as part of ecological assessments. Yet there is uncertainty about the amount of survey effort that should be deployed to facilitate bat protection. Bat activity can be extremely variable, and capturing periods of high activity can be as important as estimating parameters such as the median activity level. However the frequency and intensity of surveys required to capture the required information is unknown. Here we assessed the probability that acoustic surveys of differing durations would detect periods of high activity within a focal site and the importance of a site relative to others in a regional or national context. We randomly subsampled from 660 nights of activity data collected from 33 wind farm sites across Britain. The minimum surveying effort required to classify bat activity accurately varied between species and was dependent on weather conditions. We found that the survey periods required to give reasonable certainty in assessing risk exceeded those currently recommended in Europe. The approach of using bat activity accumulation curves, as described here, is transferrable to other situations where determining surveying effort and risk is necessary to ensure that ecological assessments provide a robust evidence base, whilst minimising the time and expense of surveys.

AB  - To realize all the advantages of harvesting haylage in rolls, it is necessary to optimize the structure of the process taking into account regional specifics, the multivariance of possible technological and technical solutions, the probabilistic nature of the existing factors and the dynamics of changes in the properties of the grass mass. The Purpose of the step-by-step optimization of the technology for harvesting haylage in rolls for specific production conditions is a rational choice of the technological scheme of the process of harvesting haylage using advanced high-performance feed-harvesting complexes. It is necessary to take into account the price and quality of the resulting haylage and ensure the minimum unit costs of material and energy resources for production. To solve such problems, an efficient graphical-analytical or topological approach is used to determine and evaluate indicators, which is based on the use of a structural and operator scheme for presenting the technology of harvesting haylage in coils. Such an approach allows: to establish the factors that influence the technological process; visualize the interaction of the studied processes and phenomena in conjunction with significant factors; determine the significance of the technological operations performed; optimize the structure of the process of harvesting haylage in rolls and machine complex; estimate the cost of hay production and feed loss.

AB  - Stability of dynamical systems is a central topic with applications in widespread areas such as economy, biology, physics and mechanical engineering. The dynamics of nonlinear systems may completely change due to perturbations forcing the solution to jump from a safe state into another, possibly dangerous, attractor. Such phenomena cannot be traced by the widespread local stability and resilience measures, based on linearizations, accounting only for arbitrary small perturbations. Using numerical estimates of the size and shape of the basin of attraction, as well as the systems returntime to the attractor after given a perturbation, we construct simple nonlocal stability and resilience measures that record a systems ability to tackle both large and small perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on the Solow-Swan model of economic growth, an electro-mechanical system, a stage-structured population model as well as on a high-dimensional system, and conclude that the suggested measures detect dynamic behavior, crucial for a systems stability and resilience, which can be completely missed by local measures. The presented measures are also easy to implement on a standard laptop computer. We believe that our approach will constitute an important step toward filling a current gap in the literature by putting forward and explaining simple ideas and methods, and by delivering explicit constructions of several promising nonlocal stability and resilience measures.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of environmental factors, namely temperature and water activity, on genes involved in the regulation of ochratoxin A (OTA) production over time. For this purpose, the previously characterized toxigenic Aspergilluscarbonarius Ac29 isolate from Greek vineyards and the A. carbonarius ITEM 5010 reference strain were subjected to combined temperature and water activity (a(w)) treatments to study OTA production and relative gene expression. The fungal isolates were grown on a synthetic grape juice liquid medium (SGM) under different temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and a(w) (0.94 and 0.98) regimes. The expression of the AcOTApks, AcOTAnrps, and laeA OTA related genes was investigated using real time PCR. Gene expression was monitored at the same time points, along with fungal biomass and OTA accumulation at three, six and nine days of incubation. In gene expression analysis, stimulation of the biosynthetic genes was observed a few days before any toxin could be detected. This fact may underline a possible early indicator of potential toxin contamination of grapes. However, the transcript levels varied with respect to the different combinations of ecophysiological conditions and time, highlighting a complex regulation of OTA related gene expression of A. carbonarius in the specific medium.

AB  - Tree species in the boreal forest cycle between periods of active growth and dormancy alter their photosynthetic processes in response to changing environmental conditions. For deciduous species, these changes are readily visible, while evergreen species have subtler foliar changes during seasonal transitions. In this study, we used remotely sensed optical indices to observe seasonal changes in photosynthetic activity, or photosynthetic phenology, of six boreal tree species. We evaluated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), the chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI), and steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence (F-S) as a measure of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), and compared these optical metrics to gas exchange to determine their efficacy in detecting seasonal changes in plant photosynthetic activity. The NDVI and PRI exhibited complementary responses. The NDVI paralleled photosynthetic phenology in deciduous species, but not in evergreens. The PRI closely paralleled photosynthetic activity in evergreens, but less so in deciduous species. The CCI and FS tracked photosynthetic phenology in both deciduous and evergreen species. The seasonal patterns of optical metrics and photosynthetic activity revealed subtle differences across and within functional groups. With the CCI and fluorescence becoming available from satellite sensors, they offer new opportunities for assessing photosynthetic phenology, particularly for evergreen species, which have been difficult to assess with previous methods.

AB  - Reasonable formulation of carbon emission reduction strategies at sub-national scale is an important technique to realize the national target. However, a set of binding unified key performance indicators (KPIs) is usually not conducive to equitable regional development. Our study employs a hybrid carbon emission estimation method and a multi-index joint representation approach to explore the inter-provincial energy-related carbon emission difference in the year of 2012 in China. Stepwise regression method and hierarchical clustering model were used to classify 30 provinces into economically developed low-carbon region, industrially optimized low-carbon region, resource-abundant high-carbon region, and economically developing high-carbon region. Different regions should take differentiated measures and KPIs related to the local government's efforts to promote low carbon roadmap according to local conditions: The lack of natural resource provides the impetus to improve energy structure in the economically developed low-carbon region. The industrially optimized low-carbon region should place great importance on economic growth and per capita GDP improvement. The low-carbon transformation strategy of the resource-abundant high-carbon regions should focus on carbon emission reduction performance and carbon intensity decline. For economically developing high-carbon regions, decision makers should conduct a sound SWOT analysis of regional low carbon development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Do aspects of quality of government, broadly defined, such as corruption, impartiality, and quality of public services, vary below the country level? The concept of quality of government (QoG) and various measures to assess it have become more ubiquitous in several social science disciplines. QoG is related with economic and social development, better environmental conditions, and better quality of life. Yet while governance indicators have proliferated in recent years, their focus remains almost universally on analysis at the country level. Moreover, the majority of indices rely on expert assessments, as opposed to the assessments of citizens, who are the on-the-ground consumers of public services. Building on a preliminary round of data collected in 2010, this study, for which data were collected in 2013, presents a novel and comprehensive index that captures the quality of governance for 206 regions in 24 European countries. The 'European Quality of Government Index', which will be published free for scholarly use, is built on the largest survey to date focusing on governance at the regional level; over 85,000 citizens were surveyed. The instrument proposed here builds on both perceptions and experiences of citizens in public service areas such as health care, education, and law enforcement. The paper presents final results of the survey, as well as a sensitivity analysis and checks for external and internal validity.

AB  - Hear shock proteins (HSPs), originally identified as heat-inducible gene products, are a family of highly conserved proteins that respond to a wide variety of stress including oxidative stress. Although both acute and chronic oxidative stress have been well demonstrated to induce HSP responses, Rae evidence is available whether increased HSP levels provide enhanced protection against oxidative stress under elevated yet sublethal temperatures. We studied relationships between oxidative stress and HSPs in a physiological model by using Garra rufa (doctor fish), a fish species naturally acclimatized to different thermal conditions. We compared fish naturally living in a hot spring with relatively high water temperature (34.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C) to those living in normal river water temperature (25.4 +/- 4.7 degrees C), and found that levels of all the studied HSPs (HSP70, RSPB, HSP90, HSC70 and GRP75) were higher in fish living in elevated water temperature compared with normal river water temperature. In contrast, indicators of oxidative stress, including protein carbonyls and lipid hydroperoxides, were decreased in fish living in the elevated temperature, indicating that HSP levels are inversely associated with oxidative stress. The present results provide evidence that physiologically increased HSP levels provide protection against oxidative stress and enhance cyLoprotection. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The balance between physicochemical processes, influencing vertical and temporal distributions of metal compounds in one relatively isolated anoxic environment, constitutes the objective of the present work. Ion activity product (IAP) was calculated for manganese and iron sulfides, in order to define the metal sulfide forms that control Fe and Mn solubility in the bottom waters of anoxic lagoons. Iron solubility depended on amorphous FeS formation, while manganese sulfides were a minor component in a solid solution lowering its solid-phase activity. A theoretical physicochemical model was developed for the iron speciation, based on experimental pH and redox potential data. A very good match was achieved for the measured and the theoretical total dissolved iron, at all depths. The dominance of oxidant iron species Fe(OH) (3) (-) in the surface waters and their sequence by FeSH+ and FeSaq in the deeper layers brings out the influence of physicochemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, sulfide, pH and E-h) in vertical distribution of dissolved metal species, in anoxic/hypoxic basins. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the distribution of manganese and iron is of special interest, not only because these are the indicators of redox conditions but also for the role of their oxidized/reduced forms in the formation of the biogeochemical structure of redox zone.

AB  - Brachidiniacean dinoflagellates have been investigated in the open waters of the Mediterranean Sea, along a transect from the south of France to the south of Cyprus (20 June-18 July 2008). Brachidinium and Karenia papilionacea often co-occurred. B. capitatum predominating in the surface waters. The highest abundance of Brachidinium were found in the upper 25 in in the western Mediterranean with a maximum (24 cells L-1) at a depth of 5 m in the Balearic Sea. Asterodinium (up to 4 cells L-I) was recorded he low of deep chlorophyll maxima. The genus Microceratium. only known from the tropical Indo-Pacific region, is reported for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea. Microceratium was found below 100 m in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with the highest abundance of 8 cells L-1 at 125 m depth, in the Levantine Basin. This study also illustrates for the first time specimens under the division of Brachidinium and Microcertnium. This first Occurrence of Microceratium in the Mediterranean Sea should be considered an indicator of climate warming. However, it should not be considered a non-indigenous taxon. Microceratium is the 'tropical morphotype', the adaptation of a local species (a life stage of Karenia - Brachidinium - Asterodinium) to the tropical environmental conditions that prevail in summer in the open Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Runoff from impervious land cover has a major impact on headwater tidal creek ecosystems resulting from ever increasing development along the coastline. Tidal creek habitats can serve as "early warning systems" for anthropogenic stressors due to their proximity to the uplands. In this study, the macrobenthic community was sampled along the longitudinal gradient of tidal creeks (i.e., first order, second order, and third order) in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia which varied in their levels of watershed development (salt marsh, forested, suburban, and urban). This study was designed to assess the condition of macrobenthic communities in tidal creek ecosystems under varying levels of anthropogenic stressors and test whether the conclusions of a previous study in South Carolina (Holland et al., J Exp Mar Biol Ecol 298:151-178, 2004) could be generalized to the southeastern USA. Metrics of community-level and species-specific response within tidal creeks draining watersheds of varying degrees of impervious cover suggest the macrobenthic community may be a useful indicator of development in tidal creeks ecosystems. The differences observed when data from all three states were pooled was consistent with previous findings in South Carolina tidal creeks which illustrates that macrobenthic communities in tidal creeks may react to watershed development in similar patterns along the southeastern coast of the USA.

AB  - A laboratory scale experiment on the survival of Escherichia coli in samples of filter media from a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland treating domestic wastewater was performed. A concentration of E. coli was examined in samples collected from a wetland filter filled with lightweight aggregates (LWA). All samples testing positive for E. coli contamination were used to examine the effect of storage time on the survival of E. coli at three temperature regimes: cold (4 degrees C), mild (10 degrees C) and warm (22 degrees C). It was found that the mild storage condition favoured the growth and survival of E. coli in the tested LWA media. The growth in samples of the uppermost layer of the media lasted for 5.5 months, during which E. coli reached a maximum concentration of 6.4 x 10(3) MPN/100 g dry matter in the media. It was also observed that E. coli had a greater capacity to survive for extended periods of time in samples collected from the upper layer of the LWA filter compared to samples taken from the deeper layers. The survival of E. colt in the shallowest samples of the wetland filter was remarkably long and unexpected, lasting for a period of over 14 months.

AB  - We explored the relationships between various socio-economic variables and the prevalence and density of invasive alien species (IAS) on a global scale using country-level data sets. We did this by testing the hypothesis that the abundance and distribution of populations of IAS are correlated with various socio-economic indicators, with the direction of causality being that the state of IAS is determined by socio-economic conditions. We found a positive and statistically significant relationship between the prevalence and density of IAS and the human development index (HDI), the satisfaction with life index and the gross domestic product (GDP) among all the countries tested. Additionally, the density of IAS increased significantly with human-population density, total geographic area, GDP and HDI. We also found a positive relationship between the density of IAS and the top 10 road networks of the world.. This provides some insight into the development of renewed policies and management strategies for invasive species across both continents and countries. We do caution, however, that the results are likely to be influenced by the sampling factor, whereby affluent countries have more resources to measure and monitor IAS than poorer countries and hence have better records of such, which then indicates a stronger relationship with the level of development.

AB  - This study consisted of sampling benthic algae at 32 sites in the Gangqu River, an important upstream tributary of the Yangtze River. Our aims were to characterize the benthic algae communities and relationships with environmental variables. Among the 162 taxa observed, Achnanthes linearis and Achnanthes lanceolata var. elliptica were the dominant species (17.10% and 14.30% of the total relative abundance, respectively). Major gradients and principal patterns of variation within the environmental variables were detected by principal component analysis (PCA). Then non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) divided all the sites into three groups, which were validated by multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that three environmental variables (TN, TDS, and TP) significantly affected the distribution of benthic algae. Weighted averaging regression and cross-calibration produced strong models for predicting TN and TDS concentration, which enabled selection of algae taxa as potentially sensitive indicators of certain TN and TDS levels: for TN, Achnanthes lanceolata, Achnanthes lanceolata var. elliptica, and Cymbella ventricosa var. semicircularis; for TDS, Cocconeis placentula, Cymbella alpina var. minuta, and Fragilaria virescens. The present study represents an early step in establishing baseline conditions. Further monitoring is suggested to gain a better understanding of this region.

AB  - The effect of environmental factors on spatial variation of the polychaete community of the alga Halopteris scoparia in Algeciras Bay (Spain) was investigated. Environmental gradients (outer and inner areas) were detected, based fundamentally on hydrodynamism, solids in suspension,% of organic matter in the sediment, and structural complexity of the plant. Polychaetes can give information on strong environmental gradients, especially pollution, but showed little discrimination among stations, due mainly to the great homogeneity generally showed by these communities. This homogeneity was the result of the quantitative importance of ubiquitous species, such as Platynereis dumerilii, Sphaerosyllis hystrix, Syllis prolifera, and Amphiglena mediterranea, among others. The outer zone, however, included a great number of species with few individuals and low dominance, among which the most characteristic was the terebellid polychaete Nicolea venustula. This species seems to have strong hydrodynamic requirements and may have been limited by excess of accumulated sediment on the alga. More of the collected species were exclusive to the outer areas, and did not penetrate into the inner bay, while most of the inner species were also found in the outer zone. As a whole, the great majority of the species were located in intermediate environmental conditions, indicating a generalist character of the polychaete species.

AB  - A methodological approach to the identification of biodiversity indicators in commercial forest stands is illustrated by analysis of the relationships between syrphid (hoverflies) and carabid (ground beetles) community composition and diversity, and stand structure and field layer vegetation. Data were collected from 12 commercial forest sites encompassing a range of climatic conditions and different crop types (Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Corsican pine) across the UK. Comparisons were also made between unmanaged semi-natural Scots pine woods and Scots pine plantations. For both syrphids and carabids, no differences in species richness and diversity were recorded between semi-natural stands and plantations; one rare syrphid considered to be restricted to semi-natural pine stands was also found in spruce. Syrphid species diversity and richness was higher in southern spruce sites than in the northern sites. Northern sites had distinctive carabid communities, as did sites in the New Forest, a large ancient woodland in southern England. Of the measured habitat variables, vertical stand structure showed the best correlation with species richness and diversity of both carabids and syrphids. Richness and diversity were less in stands with high vertical cover values for canopy layers. Stands with higher field layer cover supported greater syrphid diversity, but lower carabid diversity. Measures of stand structure could be used as potential indicators of syrphid and carabid diversity, but additional habitat parameters also need to be tested.

AB  - We present two models to assess wildlife exposure to chemical stressors in soils and food. The models incorporate information on the magnitude and spatial distribution of chemicals in soil, as well as the foraging area and movement of wildlife. The models assume wildlife are exposed to chemicals in contaminated food such as soil invertebrates, and that soil invertebrates bioaccumulate the chemicals from contaminated soil. The models compare an animal's exposure to a variety of measurement end points (e.g., mortality, reproductive success, and developmental effects), expressed as ''soil effects levels.'' The first model, the ''Average Concentration with Area Curve'' exposure model, is a simple graphical tool that evaluates the potential for effects to individuals that forage within the most contaminated areas of a site. The ''Population Effects Foraging'' (PEF) model evaluates the number of individuals within a local population that may be affected at a site. The PEF model limits an individual's movement based on the species' foraging area and site-specific information such as available habitat.
   We illustrate the models using a hypothetical hazardous waste site to demonstrate the effect of contaminant distribution on baseline conditions and remedial actions. Risk assessors can adapt the models for use with a variety of hazardous waste sites, wildlife species, and chemical stressors. Graphical presentations of the results emphasize the importance of risk presentation in conveying uncertainty to risk managers.

AB  - Packed soil columns were used to simulate and investigate in situ biological remediation of soil contaminated with diesel fuel. We investigated and evaluated several operating strategies, including continuous flooding of the column soil with nutrient solution, and periodic operating cycles consisting of flooding followed by draining and aeration. The objectives were (a) to determine the extent of diesel fuel degradation in soil columns under four operating conditions (biologically inhibited control; continuous saturation with nitrogen and phosphorus amendments; periodic operation, consisting of flooding with nitrogen and phosphorus, followed by draining and forced aeration; and periodic operation, consisting of flooding with nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium and magnesium amendments, followed by draining and forced aeration); (b) to evaluate CO2 production and oxygen consumption as indicators of biodegradation; (c) to monitor hydraulic conductivity under different operating strategies; and (d) to examine the system requirements for nitrogen and phosphorus. Our results showed that periodic operation promoted higher rates of biodegradation of diesel fuel in soil and minimized the use of water containing nutrient amendments, and consequently the possible need to collect and treat such water. We believe that monitoring CO2 and O-2 levels in situ may provide a means of optimizing the timing of flooding and aeration events to increase degradation rates. Results of this laboratory study will aid in improving the design and operation of field-scale bioremediation systems.

AB  - To study papillar morphology as a nutritional indicator, samples were taken from five areas of the rumen of reindeer calves (Rangifer tarandus tarandus L.) in late April 1986 (group 1, n = 6); early May 1987 (group 2, n = 6); December 1986 (group 3, n = 9); and November 1987 (group 4, n = 6). The reindeer in groups 3 and 4 were allowed to graze freely under natural conditions, mainly feeding on lichens, while those in groups 1 and 2 were kept in pens and fed with lichens. The reindeer had shorter papillae at all five points in the rumen in spring, and the mean and areal papillar volumes and the papillar surface area in the caudal blind sacs were smaller than in the animals studied in early winter. The papillae were shorter in the caudal blind sacs than in the other parts of the rumen. The highest number of papillae was usually found in the atrium or the caudal blind sacs, whereas the mean papillar volume and papillar surface area were greater in the dorsal and ventral walls. Even relatively low amounts of lichens, which are rich in easily soluble carbohydrates, seem to be sufficient to produce volatile fatty acids for the papillae in order to avoid their regression to any great extent. The even, dense distribution of ruminal papillae in the reindeer resembles the pattern found in other ruminants, which are classified as concentrate selectors.

AB  - The existence of freshwater ferromanganese concretions has been known for decades, but we are not aware of a generally accepted explanation for their formation, and there has been little research into their potential use as records of Holocene climate and paleohydrology. A conceptual model is presented to describe the environmental and geochemical processes which result in the formation and growth of freshwater ferromanganese concretions. In order to evaluate their potential as historical geochemical records, a concretion from Magaguadavic Lake, New Brunswick, Canada is the focus of a detailed geochronological and geochemical investigation. The radiocarbon data provide a coherent growth curve and a maximum age for the concretion of 8448 +/- 43 years, consistent with the establishment of Magaguadavic Lake as a stable post-glacial lacustrine system. The data suggest accretion rates of 1.5 and 3.4 mm per 1000 years during the Northgrippian and Meghalayan stages of the Holocene, respectively. The abrupt change in growth rate observed at the stage boundary may be an indicator of Holocene climate change. These features are consistent with inferences from previous research that warmer climate in the Northgrippian led to eutrophication in some lakes in eastern North America. The results confirm that freshwater Fe-Mn concretions may yield important information about past climatic and environmental conditions.

AB  - Wheat breeding programmes often harbour large number of developed progenies. Testing of all progenies in many target environments is not considered cost-effective, so the genomic predictions are employed. Genomic predictions might be enhanced with adaptational traits given the cost-effectiveness of their phenotyping. The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of adding a priori available phenotyping data of adaptational morpho-physiological traits to genomic predictions in Bayesian framework. The panel of 120 winter wheat genotypes was sown over four growing seasons (2013/2014-2016/2017) in field conditions in two replicates and phenotyped for target traits grain yield and plant height along with nine distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS) traits. Five genotype groups were defined by the K-means clustering method based on nine DUS traits. DUS traits were used as fixed covariates in five different genomic prediction models with different assumptions about the distribution densities of marker effects: Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, Bayesian ridge regression and Bayesian lasso. Adding DUS traits as covariates significantly improved accuracies and reduced the root mean square errors (RMSEP) of genomic predictions. Marginal differences between different models were observed. Adding covariates to genomic prediction models might be good strategy to improve accuracies of the predictions by accounting for environmental adaptations, provided their a priori availability or low costs of additional phenotyping.

AB  - Sexually selected ornaments range from highly dynamic traits to those that are fixed during development and relatively static throughout sexual maturity. Ornaments along this continuum differ in the information they provide about the qualities of potential mates, such as their parasite resistance. Dynamic ornaments enable real-time assessment of the bearer's condition: they can reflect an individual's current infection status, or they can reflect resistance to recent infections. Static ornaments, however, are not affected by recent infection but may instead indicate an individual's genetically determined resistance, even in the absence of infection. Given the typically aggregated distribution of parasites among hosts, infection is unlikely to affect the ornaments of the vast majority of individuals in a population: static ornaments may therefore be the more reliable indicators of parasite resistance. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the ornaments of male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) before experimentally infecting them withGyrodactylus turnbulli. Males with more left-right symmetrical black coloration and those with larger areas of orange coloration, both static ornaments, were more resistant. However, males with more saturated orange coloration, a dynamic ornament, were less resistant. Female guppies often prefer symmetrical males with larger orange ornaments, suggesting that parasite-mediated natural and sexual selection act in concert on these traits.

AB  - Carnivorous fish require diets with high protein content to support adequate growth, improve health status and the production of antioxidants and the ability to respond to adverse environmental conditions. However, different protein-to-carbohydrate ratios can lead to different growth responses as a result of the administration of carbohydrates rich diets for carnivores fishes. In this study, we examined the effect of diets with different levels of dietary protein (P) and carbohydrate (CH) (38 P/22CH; 38 P/26CH; 38 P/30CH; 42 P/22CH; 42 P/26CH; 42 P/30CH) and the immunological and hematological responses and growth performance of surubim (Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum x P corruscans) (mean initial weight 23.08 +/- 0.84 g) challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). High levels of dietary protein (42 % P) did not improve growth performance and, regardless of CH content, did not affect oxidative stress. High levels of dietary carbohydrate increased lysozyme production and blood variables were increased after LPS challenge, without impairing the immune response. Diets with different protein-to-carbohydrate ratios can lead to distinct physiological responses in fish which can, as a consequence, differentially impact yield, indicating that there is more than one way of feeding carnivorous fish within a safe protein inclusion range (38-42 % P).

AB  - Endangered species ecosystems require appropriate monitoring for assessing population growth related to the emerging pollutants in their habitat conditions. The response of population growth of Cobitis choii, an endangered fish species, under the exposure to emerging pollutants present in the Geum River Basin of South Korea was studied. Toxicity models of concentration addition (CA), independent action (IA), and concentration addition-independent action (CAIA) were implemented utilizing the concentration of a set of 25 chemicals recorded in the study area. Thus, a population-level response analysis was developed based on the abundance of Cobitis choii for period 2011-2015. The results were compared showing that the CA and IA models were the most conservative approaches for the prediction of growth rate. Further, a standard abnormality index (SAI) and habitat suitability (HS) indicators based on the climate, habitat, and abundance data were presented to completely analyze the population growth of the species. Suitability of the species growth was most probable for year 2015 for the variables of air temperature and land surface temperature. A spatial analysis was complementarily presented to visualize the correlation of variables for the best suitability of the species growth. This study presents a methodology for the analysis of the ecosystem's suitability for Cobitis choii growth and its assessment of the chemicals present in Geum River stream.

This study used the millipede Rhinocricus padbergi as surrogate to evaluate the toxicity of two metallic-insecticides that has been developed for leaf-cutting ants management. Millipedes were exposed in terrariums containing different concentrations of the metallic-insecticides and, after periods of 21 and 90 days, three individuals from each terrarium were dissected in order to remove the midgut, the organ where absorption of nutrients and, consequently, toxic substances occurs. The toxic action of the metallic-insecticides was analyzed through qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of morphophysiological alterations and by quantitative analysis of the HSP70 stress protein. The results showed that the metallic-insecticides may increase HSP70 labeling, although not at all concentrations and periods of exposure. Histopathological alterations were not significant at any concentration, indicating that the cytoprotective action of HSP70 is able to prevent severe damage to the midgut. It is therefore suggested that the metallic-insecticides are not toxic to the species studied here as no toxicity was observed under the conditions tested. In addition, stress protein localization in midgut helps understand how morphophysiological processes can potentially be affected by pesticide exposure.

AB  - In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) initiated a program for the re-evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavor ingredients. This publication, third in the series, considers NFCs composed primarily of constituents with the 3-phenyl-2-propenyl or a cinnamyl functional group, using the procedure outlined in 2005 and updated in 2018 to evaluate the safety of naturally-occurring mixtures for their intended use as flavor ingredients. The procedure relies on a complete chemical characterization of the NFC intended for commerce and organization of each NFC's chemical constituents into well-defined congeneric groups. The safety of the NFC is evaluated using the well-established and conservative threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept in addition to data on absorption, metabolism and toxicology of members of the congeneric groups and the NFC under evaluation. Six NFCs from the Myroxylon and Cinnamomum genera, Balsam Oil, Peru (FEMA 2117), Tolu Balsam Extract (FEMA 3069), Cassia Bark Extract (FEMA 2257), Cassia Bark Oil (FEMA 2258), Cinnamon Bark Extract (FEMA 2290) and Cinnamon Bark Oil (FEMA 2291) were evaluated and affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under their conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients.

AB  - Landslides have characteristics such as regionality, multipleness, and seriousness. The traditional area landslide spatial prediction method, under massive data condition, has poor real-time performance and strong subjectivity, and the evaluation performance is poor under multiple factors. A distributed regional landslide prediction method based on BP neural network is proposed in this paper. The algorithm is designed as a parallel computing environment of big data processing platform Spark, and the cost function of BP network is designed as two items of mean square error and L2 regularization, which improves generalization ability. Through statistics of the quantitative indicators of landslide factors and the definition of hazard index of monitoring profile, the influencing factors are selected. This approach is applied to massive data mining of 9 landslides in 11 years in Zhongxian area of Three Gorges Reservoir area, which achieves the combination of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. All the landslide monitoring sections in the study area were monthly evaluated to determine the risk level, and the spatial prediction of the monthly landslide risk degree was achieved. Experiments show that the fitting accuracy and efficiency obtained by the method are better than gradient-based decision trees and random forest algorithms, and the prediction area landslide risk assessment accuracy is good. This method can be used as a new approach for regional landslide spatial prediction.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the impact of Fusarium culmorum infection and fungicide application on malt quality of two domestic wheat genotypes, Lucija and Osk.110/09. Wheat genotypes were subjected to four different field treatments: control/natural conditions (1), fungicide treatment (2), inoculated with F. culmorum spores and treated with fungicide (3), and inoculated with F. culmorum spores (4). Lucija was a less susceptible genotype to Fusarium infection, in contrast to Osk.110/09, which showed off as more susceptible genotype. Standard malting procedure for wheat malt was implemented followed by quality and mycotoxins analysis. Results indicated that malt quality varied, depending on the genotype and applied treatment, but overall conclusions indicate that genotype Lucija is more appropriate for malting, and fungicide treatment efficiently improved malt quality. Practical applications Genotype resistance seems to be of importance in suppressing Fusarium infections, but fungicide application is also an important factor for ensuring the grain quality. Fungal influence is mostly noted in heighten protein content, which is not desirable for malting and brewing, and a decline of starch content in wheat grain. Fungicide application helped reduce the grain degradation and positively affected most wheat grain, wheat malt and wort quality indicators. The knowledge on variety resistance and fungicide application impact on wheat and malt quality contributes to the marketability of wheat intended for malting.

AB  - Genetically engineered bacterial whole-cell bioreporters were deployed to investigate bioavailable mercury (b-Hg) and phenanthrene (b-PHE). Characterized by high sensitivity and specificity in aqueous solutions, the bioreporter system could detect in amended soils the concentrations of b-Hg and b-PHE in the ranges of 19.6 to 111.6 and 21.5 to 110.9 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The sensitivity of the system allowed for the combined analysis of b-Hg and b-PHE from real environmental samples. Therefore, soil samples from three large refinery facilities were tested, and the results from the instrumental analysis strongly correlated with the ones obtained with the bioreporter method. Large-scale and fast screening of soil contamination across the Yangtze River Delta in Eastern China was conducted. More than 36% of the samples contained b-Hg, whereas the fractions of b-PHE were below the detection limit for all the samples. These results indicated a higher toxicity and more hazardous condition for Hg contamination than for PHE. Population densities and airborne 10-mm particulate matter (PM10) concentrations were used as parameters for comparison with the spatial distribution of the b-Hg and b-PHE fractions. The results revealed that the bioreporters could offer a rapid and cost-efficient method to test soil samples from contaminated areas and provide a screening tool for environmental risk assessment.

AB  - In 2013, two Pleistocene megafaunal remains, a single mammoth tooth and a partial juvenile mastodon mandible with teeth were recovered by a scallop-fisherman from two separate locations in the Merrimack River embayment off the coast of New Hampshire and Massachusetts. These specimens follow on previous finds by fishermen in the same locale over the last two decades, as well as numerous other offshore megafauna specimens and prehistoric stone tools, which have occurred in the Gulf of Maine for > 50 years. This paper examines the value and scientific sampling potential of previously recovered specimens and isolated finds in the Gulf of Maine. Specifically, it discusses isolated finds as indicators of submerged archaeological site preservation in the region, and as data sources that provide information about regional geomorphology, climate conditions, paleogenomics, and species extinctions in the terminal Pleistocene. Furthermore, submerged paleo-deltas, due to their depositional characteristics, are identified to have deeply buried paleosols with significant preservation potential for early human and environmental history. Therefore, the Merrimack River paleo-delta, and similar offshore submerged features elsewhere, serve not only as research opportunities into early human migration and settlement, but are also storehouses of climate and environmental data, which merit special recognition and protection from environmental and man-made activities that may impact or disturb these intact submerged landscapes.

AB  - In this study, sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus were sampled seasonally at three stations during 2012 in the coastal areas of the Gulf of Annaba (southeast Mediterranean). For all sea urchins, the gonad index was calculated to determine sea urchin reproductive status. Moreover, a set of biochemical parameters, including biomarkers and oxidative stress parameters, was measured in gonads. The pesticides and physiochemical parameters were measured and dosed in sea water.
   The results obtained highlighted that the levels of pesticide were generally low and below those commonly applied by environmental quality standards (EQS), indicating that no alarm state is currently present in the Gulf of Annaba. In addition to pollution, seasonal change is an important factor influencing biomarker activity, and the significant increases in biomarker levels in spring are a major observed trend. This activity may also be related to reproductive status. Seasonal variability was confirmed by the significant results of the Kruskal-Wallis test and by the high degree of divergence between seasons in PCA, with a total of 83.83% of variance explained.
   These results indicate that environmental factors that vary seasonally may affect the antioxidant status of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus.

AB  - To better understand the response of tropical wetlands to Holocene environmental changes, two lacustrine diatom records from Weipa, Cape York, have been investigated. The record from Big Willum (BW01) commenced approx. 7.9 calibrated thousand years before present (k cal a BP) and details stages of initial swamp development, a phase of ephemeral conditions between approximately 5.7 and 2.2 k cal a BP and relative wetland stability after 2.2 k cal a BP. Lithological and to a lesser extent diatom assemblage changes in BW01 appear to be linked to broad-scale changes in effective precipitation. The record from Little Willum (LW01) commenced around 0.9 k cal a BP and documents initial phases of swamp development until approximately 0.8 k cal a BP with subsequent relative wetland stability. The uppermost 10 cm of this record, approximately spanning the last 40 years, coincide with mining activity in the region. Only minor changes in the diatom assemblage are recorded for this period implying that the overall character of the swamp probably remained unchanged.
   Both sites offer new insights into wetland dynamics in Australia's dry tropics and demonstrate that changes in these lacustrine systems were probably driven by shifts in effective precipitation, in particular during the late Holocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water availability risk is a local issue best understood with watershed-scale quantification of both withdrawal and consumptive demands in the context of available supply. Collectively, all water use sectors must identify, understand, and respond to this risk. A highly visual and computationally robust decision support tool, Water Prism, quantitatively explores mitigation responses to water risk on both a facility-level and basin-aggregated basis. Water Prism examines a basin water balance for a 40- to 60-year planning horizon, distinguishes among water use sectors, and accounts for ecosystem water needs. The 2012 Texas State Water Plan was used to apply Water Prism to the Big Cypress-Sulphur Basin (Texas). The case study showed Water Prism to be an accurate and convenient tool to provide fine-scale understanding of water use in the context of available supply, evaluate multi-sector combinations of conservation strategies, and quantify the effects of future demands and water availability. Analyses demonstrated water availability risks for rivers and reservoirs can vary within a basin and must be calculated independently, simulation of water balance conditions can help illuminate potential impacts of increasing demands, and scenario simulations can be used to evaluate relative conservation efficacy of different water resource management strategies for each sector. Based on case study findings, Water Prism can serve as a useful assessment tool for regional water planners.

AB  - A North wall insulated greenhouse dryer was designed, fabricated and tested in no-load conditions under natural convection mode. Experiments were carried out in two different cases namely-Case-I and Case-II. Case-I was north wall insulated greenhouse dryer with solar air heating collector at ground and Case-II is north wall insulated greenhouse dryer without solar air heating collector. Convective heat transfer coefficient, coefficient of diffusivity, heat loss factor, heat utilisation factor and coefficient of performance were evaluated and analysed as performance indicators for newly developed system. The maximum value of coefficient of performance for Case-I was 0.9 whereas 0.86 for case-II. The highest heat utilisation factor was 0.68 for Case-I while 0.61 for Case-II. The maximum temperature difference between inside room air and ambient air for the north wall insulated greenhouse dryer with the solar collector was 30 C, 28 C and 18 C for day 1, day 2 and day 3, respectively. The inside room air temperature is 46%, 42% and 32% higher than the ambient air temperature during day 1, day 2 and day 3, respectively. The results validate the modifications, hence developed system is recommended for fruit/vegetable drying. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to examine pollen deterioration in mangrove sediments, surface sediment samples were collected from 4 different mangrove communities, placed in nylon gauze bags, and then buried back into their own vegetation in October 2010. At periods of 2, 4, and 6 months after burial, sediment bags were retrieved and examined. At each recovery, palynomorph percentages and concentrations were calculated as a means to investigate degradation rates of deposited palynomorphs and some physical factors affecting their preservation. It was found that although mangrove sediments are assumed to represent perfect depositional environments for the preservation of mangrove pollen due to the anoxic conditions, a high potential for loss of pollen was observed. Palynomorphs decayed more rapidly in the Ceriops tagal - Bruguiera spp. community, whereas this process seems to proceed at a slower rate in the Rhizophora apiculata - Bruguiera spp. community, possibly controlled by differences in sediment pH, salinity, grain size, and organic matter. The good pollen preservation of Rhizophora apiculata and Sonneratia alba in their own plant communites allow them to act as useful indicators of the forest communities in which they are dominant. On the other hand, quantitative compositional reliabilities of pollen from Avicennia alba, Bruguiera spp., and Ceriops tagal, tended to weaken by their progressive deterioration and poor preservation. However, a long term-experiment is still necessary to achieve a more accurate estimation of biases from such important taphonomic factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite targeted development efforts, Timor-Leste has some of the poorest water and sanitation performance indicators in Southeast Asia. This cross-sectional study investigated the role of social, economic, and related systematic factors on recently completed water source interventions in the country. A Rapid Assessment Process (RAP), strongly informed by ethnographic/ecologic understandings, was used to gather data in eleven urban, peri-urban, and rural settings on conditions and outcomes of the projects. Extensive information obtained through meetings with government, Inter-Governmental Organization (IGO), and NGO officials complemented these data. Reliable quantitative metrics were scarce, yet most of the communities reported overall perceived improvements in community health and well-being. A general consensus emphasized the importance of local involvement in, and integration among, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) efforts, with four communities effectively demonstrating such integration and four others making strides. Community residents' openness to outside assistance is making a difference, and traditional beliefs and customs have experienced a bit of resurgence, which is likely aiding project integration. Applied ethnography and triangulated methods proved essential in these determinations. We found that user perceptions, health outcomes, and the sustainability of such projects can be improved by emphasizing collaboration and " what-works information diffusion" among all stakeholders through all stages of project design and implementation.

AB  - The present work aims to provide a realistic picture of the efficiency along the European continental coasts of ten representative wave energy converters. The main coastal environments targeted are the western sides of Scandinavia, Ireland, UK, Iberian Peninsula and also the Mediterranean and Black seas. In order to evaluate the wave climate corresponding to these coastal areas, several reference points, located at about 50 m water depth, were defined. An analysis of the wave conditions in the target areas has been performed by considering 11-year of hindcast wave data (January 2003 December 2013) provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. At that point, the analysis was focused on the evaluation of the main wave parameters, including the expected average wave power. Thus, for all coastal environments and wave energy converters considered, besides the expected electric power and the capacity factor, some other indicators (as the normalized power) have been also evaluated. The results show that in general the converters with a nominal power greater than 2000 W can generate a significant amount of electricity, compared to the systems rated below 1000 kW, which instead appear to have higher values of the capacity factor, especially during the winter season.

AB  - Here the correlativity between NO2, a representative pollutant of vehicle exhaust, and ischemic stroke was first determined under experimental conditions following some epidemiological reports. First, we found that blood viscosity, red blood cell (RBC) aggregation-, electrophoresis- and rigidity-index in healthy rats were increased after exposure to 5 mg/m(3) NO2 for one- and three-month. Based on this, we set up stroke rat model and exposed them to NO2 at the same concentration for one week, and found that NO2 exposure time-dependently delayed neurological structure and function recovery of MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) rat, and worsened pathological injuries and apoptosis induced by MCAO operation. Endothelial and inflammatory responses, two common cellular pathomechanisms involved in ischemic brain damage, were induced in cortex by MCAO treatment and exacerbated by followed NO2 inhalation. Expression of the endothelial and inflammatory biomarkers in stroke displayed the same tendency in healthy rats after sub-acute and sub-chronic NO2 exposure as in MCAO model in a concentration-dependent manner. Our data provide evidence that environmental NO2 is an important inducer, and also a promoter of ischemic stroke, with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) being potential indicators of this effect.

AB  - The total protein associated with bioaerosol particulate matter (PM) is generally measured as an all-inclusive indicator of airborne biological material, which may enhance the effects of allergens, allergic and asthmatic responses. To investigate the level and seasonal variations of biological loading, PM10 were collected in a metropolitan area of Hefei, central China from June 2008 to February 2009 and analyzed for total protein mass, trace elements, and water-soluble ions. The protein concentration in PMK, ranged from 2.08 to 36.71 mu g m(-3) with an average of 11.42 mu g m(-3). This was the highest value reported so far in the literature. The total protein was found to have a significant correlation with the air pollution index (API) and mean visibility (VV), indicating the potential influence of anthropogenic sources and/or crustal sources. The protein content displayed an obvious seasonal variation with respect to weather conditions. In the rainy season the level of protein was low, while in the dry season and foggy weather the level of protein was relatively high. A correlation analysis revealed that the relationship between total protein concentration and water-soluble ions K+ and NO3- in PM10 during the dry season is 0.92 and 0.66 (P < 0.05), respectively, suggesting that anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning are main contributors during this period.

AB  - Plant fossils recently collected from the Middle-Late Triassic Madygen Formation in SW Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia are described in detail. Based on the combination of gross morphology and epidermal/cuticular anatomy, four different taxa are identified, assigned to the Cycadales, i.e. Pseudoctenis lanei and Bennettitales, Pterophyllum pinnatifidum, P. firmifolium and Otozamites sp. All taxa are new for the Madygen Formation. Remarkable is the first occurrence of Pseudoctenis and two Pterophyllum species in the Triassic of Central Asia. The fossils are generally well preserved, but without cuticles. Nevertheless, epidermal and cuticular features can be recognized because the cuticles left behind imprints in the very fine-grained matrix. Silicon casts, examined under a stereomicroscope and with SEM, revealed xeromorphic features that are traditionally considered as indicators of arid conditions. However, comparisons of the functionality of the xeromorphic features in living plants show that these features occur in xerophytic, as well as in hygrophytic and halophytic plants. Sedimentological data from Madygen show that the fossil flora grew in alluvial plains, delta plains, and shallow lacustrine environments. The xeromorphic features are consequently interpreted as functional adaptations to environmental influences involved in the self-cleaning of the leaf surface, regulation of excessive radiation and leaf temperature and as an effective mechanical defense against phytophagous insects.

AB  - To expand the raw materials base for the production of biodiesel fuel, it is advantageous to make use of biobutanol (B) produced from renewable resources, which can be used in two ways as fuel for diesel engines: by direct inclusion into multicomponent fuel for diesel engines or by producing fatty acid butyl esters from rapeseed oil. Multicomponent fuels D70/B30, D70/B15/RME(RBE)15, and D50/B25/RME(RBE)25 meet the standards for fossil diesel fuel (D) and biodiesel fuel in terms of the main indicators of quality. When 30% biocomponents are included in a mixture with fossil diesel fuel, the effective efficiency factor of the engine (eta(c)) is as high as that of pure fossil diesel fuel, and reductions are achieved in the emission of all harmful components (CO, HC, NOx, and BSN). Usage of a such mixture is more promising if compared with a mixture containing higher content of biocomponents. Increase of biocomponents to 50% causes an increase in eta(c) of up to 4% compared to that of fossil diesel fuel, reduction in emissions of CO and BSN, and little change in the level of NOx and HC emissions. Also, the three-component fuel containing rapeseed butyl esters has better qualities than fuel containing rapeseed methyl esters. The introduction of biobutanol in three-component mixture instead of ethanol is more promising due to the better performance and environmental characteristics of the fuel.

AB  - An extensive vegetation survey was carried out in 1978 in 'De Maten', one of Flanders' most diverse heathland reserves. As a consequence of this study, extensive grazing was introduced as a management regime. In 2003, all plots were again surveyed in order to examine whether vegetation composition and diversity have changed over this 25-year period, and hence to evaluate the long-term effects of extensive grazing on vegetation composition and diversity under the prevailing conditions of increased nitrogen deposition and acidification in Flanders. To gain a comprehensive insight into the changes in the plant communities, vegetation change was studied at three different hierarchical levels (community, plot and species level). Overall, heathland vegetation has little changed during the study period and the proposed management seems to have succeeded in preserving the characteristic heathland vegetation and in retaining its typical nutrient-poor, acid character. Our results indicate that an extensive grazing management, as commonly applied in many nature reserves, is able to conserve species diversity in heathlands subject to high levels of nitrogen deposition and acidification. However, a low grazing intensity is not able to fully prevent shrub and tree encroachment. Also, in the moist and wet heathlands, extensive grazing does not seem to be sufficient to prevent increasing grass dominance. Therefore, occasional additional mechanical management is needed.

AB  - Land use models provide a way to examine the impacts of future urbanization and alternative land use regulations on the environment before irreversible changes are made. A simple spatially-explicit model was used to explore potential build-out conditions under different sets of regulations for the Barnegat Bay watershed, New Jersey, USA. Four build-out scenarios were created based on: (1) current regulations, (2) down zoning, (3) protecting a buffer around wetlands, and (4) open space protection. Various indicators were used to measure the impacts of build-out land use on: (1) water demand, (2) urban non-point source pollution, and (3) terrestrial habitat fragmentation. Potential change from 1995 to build-out and differences between the four build-out scenarios were identified based on the indicators. The analysis suggests that substantial changes will occur in the watershed before build-out, but that there is little difference between the four regulatory scenarios examined. In all cases, water demand is projected to exceed water supply, water quality is projected to be severely impacted in several locations, and terrestrial habitat will be further fragmented. Based on these results, the ability of regulatory approaches commonly used in the United States' coastal zones to protect water and terrestrial resources from future development should be questioned.

AB  - Groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDISW) is of concern in communities where growing public demand on groundwater resources has resulted in increased withdrawals and hydraulic stress near surface water bodies. Under these conditions, contaminants such as methyl-tert butyl ether ( MTBE) and biological materials have been detected in domestic wells. Other contaminants and pathogens associated with surface water are not routinely tested for in groundwater-supplied systems. To address the need for methods to easily identify potentially vulnerable supplies, a direct immunoassay for the quantitative detection of diatoms in raw water samples was developed as a measure of surface water influence on groundwater. Cell wall preparations from Nitzschia palea Kutzing, a freshwater diatom found throughout North America, were used to produce a polyclonal antibody that was applied in a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) developed to detect the presence of N. palea cell wall components. The direct immunoassay allows detection at 500 cells L-1, a level similar to diatom concentrations observed in samples of groundwater collected near the test site. This investigation was the first attempt to utilize an ELISA as an indicator of surface water influence on groundwater. Further research is needed to develop more specific diatom-based monoclonal antibodies, determine cross-reactivity, and optimize sample processing and ELISA procedures for development of a standardized method.

AB  - Tuberculosis continues to be a major world health threat, The etiologic agent is among the vegetative organisms most resistant to chemical disinfection. Tuberculocidal efficacy testing for regulatory approval of chemical germicides has evolved considerably over the past decade, A method currently in use is the Environmental Protection Agency Tuberculocidal Activity Test Method, a suspension test using a Mycobacterium bovis culture grown under specific conditions and stored frozen until used. Differing tuberculocidal label claims on products with similar formulations have raised questions concerning the equivalence of test suspensions prepared by different laboratories. Five M. bovis suspensions from laboratories currently performing this test were compared against a battery of three disinfectants at a single test site, A significant difference between test cultures was found, with two of the Eve exhibiting a significant difference from the other three and also from each other, There was a significant culture-by-disinfectant interaction, indicating that the five cultures did not respond in a consistent manner across the different disinfectants used. However, these differences were due to cultures that were not prepared in accordance with the standard procedure or otherwise did not meet the test suspension criteria. In addition, a 0.55% sodium hypochlorite solution was found to be a sensitive indicator of culture variability. These data reinforce the need to adhere to published procedures and guidelines when growing and preparing a tuberculocidal test suspension and shed light on the variables associated with this type of testing.

AB  - Nutrient use-efficiency (NUE) is commonly measured in relation to vegetative growth without regard for economic productivity of crops whose valued product is reproductive. Although vegetative measures can be useful, particularly in forage crops, their validity in the quantification of NUE in grain crops is questionable. This study was undertaken primarily to examine the relationship between vegetative and economic potassium use-efficiency (KUE) in several wheat (T. aestivum) genotypes under conditions of potassium stress. Genotype environment interaction for vegetative KUE was also examined. Vegetative KUE was assessed as shoot fresh weight, efficiency ratio (VKER) and utilization index (VKUI) whereas economic KUE was evaluated as grain weight, total weight and economic efficiency ratio (EKER). Significant genotype-environment interactions for shoot weight, VKER and VKUI were observed. In some instances interaction was associated with crossovers between genotypes indicating that it can affect selection. Correlations between vegetative and economic measures of KUE were generally nonsignificant, but negative and significant for shoot weight of three-week-old plants and grain weight. It appears that if genotypes differ considerably for harvest index and it is not positively correlated with total biomass, vegetative measures of KUE are unreliable as indicators of economic KUE. Therefore, economic rather than vegetative measures should be used to evaluate KUE in crops whose valued product is reproductive.

AB  - After a general introduction referring to the contemporary debate about psychiatric classification, the nature of so-called ''diagnostic criteria'' in psychiatry is discussed with special reference to DSM-III(-R) and to organic mental syndromes and disorders. A set of diagnostic criteria for a disease category can be intended alternatively (i) as stating logically necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the diagnostic concept in question, or (ii) as providing contingent (probabilistic) indicators of the discase. In one possible interpretation, a main aim of DSM-III and DSM-III-R has been to formulate type (i), logical criteria, which amounts to an attempt to strictly identify syndromes or disorders with complex (polythetic) sets of easily observable symptoms and signs. It is shown that a logical interpretation would lead to such unwanted consequences for clinical and scientific practice that it could not possibly have been intended by the authors of DSM-III and DSM-III-R. But neither can the alternative interpretation in terms of type (ii), contingent or probabilistic indicators be consistently upheld. The conclusion of the essay is that the semantic status of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-III and DSM-III-R is fundamentally blurred. This unclarity may very well lead to divergent interpretations of the concepts and to corresponding uncertainties in their clinical and scientific application.

AB  - The theoretical concept of "climate-smart forestry" aims to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation to maintain and enhance forests' contributions to people and global agendas. We carried out two local transdisciplinary collaboration processes with the aim of developing local articulations of climate-smart forestry and to identify barriers, pathways and indicators to applying it in practice. During workshops in northern and southern Sweden, local stakeholders described how they would like forests to be managed, considering their past experiences, future visions and climate change. As a result, the stakeholders framed climate-smart forestry as active and diverse management towards multiple goals. They identified several conditions that could act both as barriers and pathways for its implementation in practice, such as value chains for forest products and services, local knowledge and experiences of different management alternatives, and the management of ungulates. Based on the workshop material, a total of 39 indicators for climate-smart forestry were identified, of which six were novel indicators adding to the existing literature. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding the local perspectives to promote climate-smart forestry practices across Europe. We also suggest how the concept of climate-smart forestry can be further developed, through the interplay between theory and practice.

AB  - This research was intended to analyze the water quality of the Cikapundung River in Bandung City around the densely-inhabited slums and also to analyze the total number of bacteria coliform and Escherichia coli in the Cikapundung River, Bandung City. The research data was obtained by observing and performing a laboratory analysis through the assessment of environmental quality standard threshold based on the Government Regulation (PP) No. 82 of 2001. The results of laboratory analysis show that the actual condition of water quality of the Cikapundung River is overall classified as polluted, indicating 7 microbiological and physico-chemical parameters which have exceeded the quality standard such as: TSS. DO. BOD. COD. detergent/surfactant, total conform, and Escherichia coll. In the upper part, there are 6 parameters below the quality standard, consisting of 4 physico-chemical parameters and 2 microbiological parameters. In the middle part, there are 8 parameters below the quality standard consisting of 6 physico-chemical parameters and 2 microbiological parameters. In the lower part, there are 6 parameters that exceeded the quality standard consisting of 4 physico-chemical parameters and 2 microbiological parameters. The seasonal difference of parameters averagely has shown that the water quality in the rainy season is better than in the dry season. However, on average, the water sampling taken before flowing to the village has a better quality than past the village.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to assess the possibility of applying the industry livestock valuation index as proposed by Karolina Pasula during the public defense of the doctoral dissertation "Directions and conditions for the standardization of accounting in agricultural enterprises" as an alternative method of valuation, taking into account sources of information and risk assessment on a farm.
   Methodology: The research process was divided into three main stages: (1) examining the possibility of applying the industry indicator for measuring biological assets proposed by K. Pasula for the valuation of livestock, i.e. pigs, as exemplified by a selected farm whose undertakings are known to the authors; (2) repeating the study from stage 1 on the valuation of dairy cattle as exemplified by the farm the activities of which are known to the authors; (3) on the basis of the conclusions of stage 1 and stage 2 studies, possible modification of the industry indicator for measuring biological assets, conducting research on a larger group of farms breeding livestock.
   Findings & value added: The conducted research confirmed the possibility of applying the analyzed ratio in the practice of entities that do not keep accounting books. The obtained results are characterized by high cognitive value as a measure of biological assets in relation to pigs. The valuation based on the industry measurement index in farms takes into account the risk which, as shown in the research, is an important factor influencing the value from the valuation.

AB  - Minerals and metals are of uttermost importance in our society, and mineral resources on and beneath the deep ocean floor represent a huge potential. Deciding whether mining from the deep ocean floor is financially, environmentally and technologically feasible requires information. Due to great depths and harsh conditions, this information is expensive and time and resource consuming to obtain. It is therefore important to use every piece of data in an optimum way. In this study, data retrieved from images and expert knowledge were used to estimate minimum and maximum nodule abundances at image locations from an area in the Clarion-Clipperton-Zone of the equatorial North East Pacific. From the minimum and maximum values, box cores and the spatial correlation quantified through variogram, a conditional expectation and associated uncertainty were obtained through the Gibbs sampler. The conditional expectation and the uncertainty were used with the assumed certain abundance data from the box cores in a kriging exercise to obtain better informed estimates of the block by block abundance. The quality assessment of the estimations was done based on distance criterion and on kriging quality indicators like the slope of regression and the weight of the mean. From the original image locations, alternative image configurations were tested, and it was shown that such alternatives produce better estimates, without extra costs. Future improvements will focus on improving the estimation of the minimum and the maximum values at image locations.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to assess the water quality in the Sidi Abderrahmane freshwater reservoir (Safi, Morocco). The monitoring data used in the study included physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. The spatial and temporal characteristics of these parameters was evaluated by collecting water samples fortnightly from May 2011 to December 2012 in three stations chosen to represent different parts of the reservoir. Ten parameters considered as indicators of water properties were analysed: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electric conductivity, transparency, orthophosphorus, ammonium, nitrites, nitrates, and chlorophylla. The results show that nutrient concentrations were among the highest (mean concentrations: PO3-= 0.64 mg l(-1), NH4+= 1.08 mg l(-1)) recorded for Moroccan freshwater reservoirs. Our data indicated that the Sidi Abderrahmane is a destratified reservoir that it is relatively warm (mean temperature: 22.42 +/- 4.88 degrees C); a polymictic reservoir in a semi-arid climate. Fertilisers applied in the surrounding orchards affect significantly affect nutrient levels in the waterbody, particularly PO(3-)and NH(4+)in autumn. The water column is seasonally homogeneous, as a result of wind-induced mixing, and our tests showed no anoxia throughout the study period. With suitable hydraulic conditions (short residence time, short outflow/inflow ratio, good oxygenation, and homogeneity), the Sidi Abderrahmane water body could reduce the stratification time and improve water quality.

AB  - Sewage sludge has been used as a soil amendment because it is rich in plant essential nutrients and can serve as a substitute for chemical fertilizers. However, sewage sludge can contain a complex mixture of pollutants that are harmful to organisms. Considering that the management of the waste should not result in risks to environmental health, the toxic potential of sewage sludge to organisms at different trophic levels should be measured before it final disposal. Diplopod (Rhinocricus padbergi) and fish (Xiphophorus maculates) were exposed to sewage sludge or sewage sludge treated with lime (biosolid) at different dilutions under laboratory conditions. Semiquantitative histopathological analyses were performed on target organs (midgut and fat body for the diplopod and gills for the fish). Toxins from sludge or biosolid caused tissue damage and activated detoxification processes in both the diplopod and fish. In comparison to other sludge concentrations, the highest sludge concentrations tested were more toxic, and millipedes likely reduced their food intake to avoid toxins, resulting in weight loss. Our data suggest that sewage sludge pathogens promoted specific histological alterations. Chemical analysis revealed that the concentrations of priority pollutants did not exceed the limits established by Brazilian law. Therefore, this outcome indicates that R. padbergi and X. maculates are sensitive to low levels of toxins from sewage sludge.

AB  - Global water shortage seriously threatens rice growth especially in irrigated production areas. Association of plants with beneficial soil microbes is one strategy for plant adaption to environmental stresses. In this study, rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were colonized by the beneficial root-colonizing endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica (P. indica). We demonstrate that grain yield were higher in P. indica-colonized rice plants compared to the uncolonized plants grown in soil. Moreover, P. indica effect on improving water stress tolerance in rice and its physiological mechanism were investigated in a hydroponic culture system. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was applied to the culture solution to conduct the water stress condition. Water stress-induced leaf wilting and impairments in photosynthetic efficiency were diminished in P. indica-colonized plants. Furthermore, P. indica colonization promotes stomata closure and increases the leaf surface temperature under water stress. The malondialdehyde level (as an indicator for oxidative stress) was lower and the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio was higher in P. indica-colonized and PEG-exposed rice plants compared to the uncolonized plants. Furthermore, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione reductase were up-regulated in inoculated rice seedlings under water stress. In conclusion, P. indica promotes rice performance under water stress by stomata closure and lower oxidative stress.

AB  - In Hungary the drinking water supply is mainly based on groundwater, in which radionuclides are common components. Since the mobility of the most common radionuclides, uranium and radium, is strongly influenced by the geochemical conditions, knowledge on the geochemical parameters of water is required. This depends on the flow system and the flow regime. Therefore, hydrogeology has a crucial role in revealing the origin of elevated activity concentrations. This research presents a case study in Hungary where the drinking water supply is provided by bank filtered and karst wells. In most of the wells of the research area the gross alpha values are above the screening level, 0.1 Bq L-1. The aim of this study is to determine which radionuclides may cause the elevated radioactivity and explain their occurrence using the hydrogeological approach. All samples of the study were analysed for (U-238+U-234), Ra-226, Rn-222. Alpha spectrometry applied on Nucfilm discs was used to measure the uranium and radium activity while radon activity was determined by liquid scintillation. The study revealed the correlation between the river water level fluctuation and the uranium content of the wells. The results of this study highlighted the transient nature of river bank filtered systems, which should be taken into account in the monitoring and water supply strategy.

AB  - Currently, gas disasters in tunnels occur frequently and cause severe casualties and property losses. However, there are few studies on the risk assessment of gas tunnels, especially comprehensive analysis of the safety risk of gas tunnels considering multiple factors. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment method for safety risk of gas tunnel construction based on fuzzy Bayesian network. The results of safety risk assessment are determined by two aspects: risk probability and risk hazard. In the process of assessment, 12 risk indicators were extracted from 32 important factors by the principal component analysis method, and a fuzzy interpretative structural modeling was established and converted into a fuzzy Bayesian network to evaluate the risk probability. The risk index weight was obtained through principal component analysis, and the risk hazard level was calculated by using the fuzzy comprehensive assessment method in combination with the hazard degree of the risk index. After a comprehensive assessment of gas concentration and other field conditions, the relevant parameters such as the fuzzy interpretative structural modeling and fuzzy Bayesian network are determined. This paper selects two construction segments of the Like tunnel as case studies to verify the feasibility and application prospects of this method. The method establishes a safety risk assessment model for gas tunnels, which can allow management personnel to fully evaluate gas tunnel risk and provides a safe construction environment.

AB  - Human heat stress and strain indices have been developed to ascertain the thresholds of human health and wellbeing. This study illustrates the matrices of environmental and behavioural indicators of warmth assessment (human thermal indices), referring to seasonal meteorological trend across the varied climatic regions of India. Effectiveness of the indices were explored using spatial and temporal analysis of regions. Human thermal indices are broadly grouped as direct (climatic, e.g., WBGT), rational (energy balance, e.g., SET*), perception (sensation voting, e. g., PMV) indices and CFD simulations. The warmth classification as regard to the temporal trend evidently differs to a great extent between the indices. Further to the spatial patterns in the studied regions also demonstrate inconsistent gradation. Elaborate derivation of the indices shows large deviations of the relative weightages in different indices, which may partly be attributed to the inconsistencies observed. For example, In case of WBGT, higher weightage is given to relative humidity, resulting in flattening in the climate trend, whereas, the energy balance models cover heat exchange between human body and environment. The rational indices, e.g., SET* and Esk (evaporation through skin) that take into account both meteorological and behavioural dimensions respond more effectively to both temporal and spatial trend analysis.

AB  - Boserup's pioneering theory holds that rising population density can be accompanied by sustainable agricultural intensification. But can this positive relationship be sustained indefinitely, or are there conditions under which rising population density can lead to declining agricultural productivity? This study utilizes survey data on farm households in Kenya and soil samples on their main maize plots to assess whether Boserupian agricultural intensification is sustainable at high population densities. The study employs econometric estimation methods to assess the effect of land management practices and population density on soil quality and then determines the effect of soil quality on crop productivity. Results show evidence of endogenous sustainable agricultural intensification accompanied by improvements in soil quality and crop yields at low population densities. However, as population densities exceed roughly 600 persons/km(2), we observe a deterioration in indicators of soil organic and reactive carbon, soil pH, and plant available phosphorous. Deterioration in soil quality leads to binding nutrient constraints associated with reduced crop yield response to inorganic fertilizer application that further reduces crop productivity. These results raise the specter of unsustainable forms of agricultural intensification associated with deteriorating soil capital, and point to the imperative of identifying and implementing effective strategies for increasing farmers' use of sustainable land management practices in rural areas facing already high and rising population densities.

AB  - Composting could be regarded as a process of processes because it entails a number of complex chemical and microbiological reactions and transformations. Nitrification is one of such processes that normally takes place during the curing phase. This process has been studied in detail for wastewater treatment, and it is becoming an extensively studied topic within composting. In the past, nitrate presence in compost has been clearly perceived as a maturation indicator; however, nowadays, nitrate formation is also conceived as a way of conserving nitrogen in compost. Nitrification is a process closely linked to other processes such as ammonification and the possible loss of ammonia (NH3).
   Nitrification is defined as conversion of the most reduced form of nitrogen (NH3) to its most oxidized form (i.e. nitrate) and it is performed in two steps which are carried out by two different groups of microorganisms: the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or archaea (AOB/AOA) and the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The objectives of this review are: a) to gather relevant information on nitrification, which can specifically occur during composting, b) to outline ultimate findings described by the literature in order to increase the understanding and the application of nitrification within composting, and c) to outline future research direction.

AB  - The heat and power generation sector is facing fundamental changes for transition to a low carbon scenario due to significant environmental constraints. This paper is evaluating from techno-economic point of view the integration of post-combustion CO2 capture technologies into coal-based CFBC power plants operated in sub- and super-critical steam conditions. Two post-combustion CO2 capture technologies were assessed: a chemical gas-liquid absorption using alkanolamines (Methyl-DiEthanol-Amine - MDEA) and a gas-solid adsorption using calcium-based sorbent (Calcium Looping - CaL). The analysis evaluates how chemical gas-liquid absorption/gas-solid adsorption influence the techno-economic performances of CFBC power plants. As benchmark cases used to quantify the energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture, the correspondent sub- and super-critical CFBC plants without CO2 capture were considered. As the results show, the CaL concepts exhibits better net electrical efficiency (35% vs. 32%), higher carbon capture rate (97% vs. 90%) and improved economic indicators (e.g. 1860 vs. 2552 (sic)/kW net power as specific capital investment, 34 vs. 41.6 (sic)/MWh as O&M costs, 66 vs. 84 (sic)/MWh as cost of electricity) compared to the MDEA cases (all these values being reported for the super-critical CFBC designs).

AB  - Osteometric measurements of the femur are consistently used to estimate stature, sex, and race in constructing demographic profiles. The presence of positive or negative changes in the size of the maximum vertical diameter of the femoral head could potentially affect the validity of such profiles. Additionally, changes in femoral head size may be an indicator of the socioeconomic status, health, and nutrition of a population over periods of time. Two large data sets consisting of white male and white female femoral vertical head diameter measurements with birth years spanning 1841-1990 are used in this study. A combination of both LOESS and piecewise regression models determined the presence of secular changes in femoral head size. Tests of the residuals were also conducted to assess normality of the data and goodness of fit of the nonlinear models. The results indicate that white males and females experienced nonsignificant increases in femoral head diameter size before 1920 and significant decreases in size thereafter. The results of this study are consistent with other studies that have identified changes in body and skeletal morphology. Considerable changes and improvements in environmental conditions that humans have experienced since the mid-nineteenth century likely contribute to the decrease in femoral head size observed in this study.

AB  - This study develops a new approach to quantitatively identify the most important determinants of urban water use. The approach is based on a data mining model called genetic programming (GP), which automatically optimizes the structure of the function and parameters simultaneously. With historical urban water use as the target, the GP model identifies the most relevant factors for 47 cities in northern China. Compared with conventional regressive models, the GP model performs better than the double-log model. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) of the GP model is 0.87, while the NSE of the double-log model is 0.79. According to the results of the case study, urban water use is determined by both socio-economic and natural variables. Total population, service industry indicators, green land area, housing area, water price, and rainfall are the most significant determinants of urban water use. Among them, total population, service industry indicators, and green land area clearly have positive contributions to urban water use, whereas rainfall has a negative impact on urban water use. The impacts of housing area and water price are complex, which implies that these determinants may have different impacts on urban water use in different conditions. The new model and new insights developed in this study could be helpful for urban water management, especially for cities that experience water scarcity.

AB  - The study was aimed at determining the origin and geological evolution of lignites from the Smederevsko Pomoravlje field (Kostolac Basin, Serbia). The possibility of a rational utilization of the coal was also considered. For this purpose, numerous organic geochemical analyses were applied to representative lignite samples. The obtained results showed that the coal from the Smederevsko Pomoravlje field is a typical humic coal. The peat-forming vegetation was dominated by gymnosperm plants. The coal-forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae, Phyllo-cladaceae and Pinaceae. Other precursors of organic matter (OM) were microbial biomass ferns and angiosperms. It was established that peatification occurred in a neutral to slightly acidic, fresh water environment Under anoxic to suboxic redox conditions. The maturity of the OM is low, in the phase of intense diagenetic processes. The biomarker compositions and values of the corresponding parameters revealed that the Smederevsko Pomoravlje field, the Drmno field (Kostolac Basin) and the "A" field (Kovin deposit) represent a part of a unique lignite basin. The results of this study suggest possible rational utilization of the Smederevsko Pomoravlje lignites in thermal power plants. This is particularly related to samples from coal seam I. A significant amount of gas could be generated from lignites at higher maturities. Eight samples met the basic assumptions for effective gasification.

AB  - PHYSICAL RESILIENCE OF TWO RED OXISOLS UNDER NO-TILLAGE The physical resilience of soil is the result of regenerative processes with cycles of wetting and drying, freezing and thawing, as well as of biological activities, This study tested the hypothesis that the physical properties of soil such as soil permeability, bulk density, aeration porosity, and total porosity are efficient physical indicators to quantify the resilience of soils with different textures exposed to mechanical stress (compression) and after subsequent wetting and drying cycles. The objective was to evaluate the behavior and soil resilience by means of physical properties of an Oxisol. Twenty-five undisturbed samples were taken (0.00-0.05 m) from two soils: a clayey soil and a soil with sandy clay loam texture, and the physical properties determined in the treatments: before compression (A), after compaction (C0) and after wetting and drying cycles (C1, C2, C3, C4). The properties bulk density and porosity did not return to the initial condition after compression in soil I and II, the volumetric content of water and air-filled porosity were only partially recovered in soil I, and soil permeability to air was the property with best recovery and resilience. Regarding the different behavior of the two soils, it was observed that soil I was more resilient than soil II in the properties with recovery.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of females for artificial reproduction of common tench based on an analysis of the size and percentage share of oocytes sampled in vivo. The females were collected from natural waters (lakes) during the spawning season, After catching, the selected fish were transported to the hatchery, where the fish were kept under controlled conditions and oocytes were collected from all females. It was found that sampled oocytes were different in size and developmental stages. Oocytes were classified into 3 groups: small, medium and large. The diameter intervals for each group were 0.18-0.22 mm, 0.48-0.57 mm and 0.95-1.01 mm, respectively. Analysis of the percentage of the largest oocytes showed that their numbers decreased in time from over 40% on Day 1 to slightly over 10% on Day 10. A positive correlation was found between the percentage of the largest oocytes in the cathetered egg sample and the weight of the stripped eggs during artificial reproduction. The percentage of the largest oocytes (diameter 0.95-1.01 mm) might be used as an indicator of the possibility of reproducing wild tench. No statistical differences were observed in latency time and embryo survival of females showing different quantities of the largest oocytes.

AB  - Historic parchment is an extremely complex material, not only due to the various methods of production used and various past environmental histories of objects, but also due to its inhomogeneous structure. Many traditional methods of characterisation are empirical, but useful since they have gained recognition by the end-users. In this paper, we investigated the shrinkage temperature of collagen and the influence of lipids contained in parchment on the measurements. While the content of lipids does not seem to significantly affect shrinkage temperature measurements themselves, it strongly affects the decrease of shrinkage temperature of collagen during degradation, and thus its thermomechanical properties. This confirms the high importance of lipid peroxidation during degradation of parchment.
   While shrinkage temperature determination is a micro-destructive method, we also demonstrated that it is possible to determine this property using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy based on partial least squares calibration. The root-mean square error of validation (RMSEV), obtained on a set of variously delipidised and degraded samples, was 7A degrees C, so the method could be used for condition assessment or classification of historic objects. Using a set of 185 historic objects dating from 1200-1800, we also developed a method for non-destructive dating of parchment based on NIR spectroscopy using partial least squares regression (RMSEV=72 years), and successfully determined the correct age of a historic charter from the collection of Nationaal Archief, The Netherlands.

AB  - Evaluating the effectiveness of public participation in EIA related decisions is of crucial importance for developing a better understanding of overall EIA effectiveness. This paper aims to contribute to the professional debate by establishing a country specific evaluation framework for Pakistan, which, it is suggested, could also potentially be used in other developing countries. The framework is used to evaluate performance of public participation in EIA in terms of 40 attributes for four selected projects from the province of Punjab. The evaluation is based on interviews with stakeholders, review of EIA reports as well as public hearing proceedings and environmental approval conditions. The evaluation of the selected projects revealed an overall weak influence of public participation on substantive quality of EIA and on the final decision. Overall, EIA public participation has succeeded in providing a more egalitarian environment. Furthermore, it appears fair to say that sufficient time for submitting written comments on EIA reports as well as for raising concerns during public hearings had been given. Also, public consultation was significantly contributing to educating participants. Despite some impediments, it is argued that public participation in EIA is gradually gaining ground in Pakistan. Recommendations to enhance EIA public participation effectiveness in Pakistan include applying a more proactive approach which should take place before EIA is conducted and before site selection for development projects is happening.

AB  - Presque Isle Bay, Lake Erie, was listed as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the International Joint Commission in part because of the high incidence of external tumor in brown bullheads. Verifying the source of the possible contaminant exposure is critical to addressing the AOC designation. We used telemetry tracking (n = 49 fish) to test the hypothesis that adult bullheads captured within the bay during spawning season do not exit the bay during the post-spawning summer and fall months. We analyzed genetic variation at 15 microsatellite loci for 112 adult fish from 5 locations, 4 inside the bay and I outside, in order to test for possible differences. Data from fixed-station receivers suggested fish did not leave Presque Isle Bay during the study period. Predicted locations outside Presque Isle Bay were only 0.1% of all predicted locations and were below the 0.2% error rate based on known manual relocations. However, there was evidence for movement within Presque Isle Bay. Most movement was between Misery Bay or Lagoons and the open bay area. Whereas telemetry results showed tendency for adult site fidelity, genetic results showed no differences among locations, indicating that there is a single panmictic population. Our telemetry data suggest that brown bullheads are likely a useful indicator species for environmental conditions in Presque Isle Bay, since adults likely are retained in the system.

AB  - Aims: To characterize the bacterial composition of mallard duck faeces and determine if novel bacterial species are present that could be utilized as potential indicators of avian faecal contamination.
   Methods and Results: Combined samples of fresh faeces from four ducks were serially diluted and plated onto six different media selected to allow the growth of a range of organisms at 42 degrees C under three atmospheric conditions: aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic. Forty-seven morphologically dissimilar isolates were purified and partial sequencing of the16S rRNA indicated at least 31 bacterial species. Twenty of these could be identified to the species level including pathogenic species of Bacillus, Campylobacter, Clostridium and Streptococcus. Other species identified included: Enterococcus, Escherichia, Megamonas, Cellulosimicrobium, Neisseria, Staphylococcus and Veillonella. Potentially novel species, which could represent bacteria specific to avian fauna included Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Macrococcus and Peptostreptococcus, while four isolates had < 97% similarity to known bacterial species in the available databases.
   Conclusion: A survey of the natural microflora of the mallard duck and its hybrid with the grey duck identified both bacteria that are potentially human pathogenic and putative novel bacteria species as determined by 16S rRNA sequencing.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study provides further evidence that duck faeces is a potential human health hazard, and has identified bacteria potentially useful for distinguishing duck faeces from other faecal sources.

AB  - Development, survival, reproduction rate, and population growth parameters of the mealy plum aphid Hyalopterus pruni (Geoffroy) (Hom.: Aphididae) were evaluated on four different apricot cultivars (Tyrinte, Sakit, Colomer, and Bebeco) under field conditions in the Van region of Turkey. Experiments were carried out on exterior leaves of trees, 1.5-2 m above the ground. Plexiglas clip-cells (25 x 6 mm) with the upper side covered by muslin were used in the experiments. The mealy plum aphid performed better on Tyrinte than on the other cultivars tested. The fastest development time (first instar to adult; 9.4 days), highest daily reproduction rate (2.6 offspring/aphid/day), and highest total fecundity (48.1 offspring/aphid) were obtained on Tyrinte. The intrinsic rate of increase - a good indicator of the growth potential of a population - of individuals fed on Tyrinte was significantly greater than that of individuals fed on cvs. Colomer and Bebeco. While mean generation times (T.) of populations on different cultivars were close to each other, the net reproductive rate was the highest (29.45 offspring/aphid/generation) on Tyrinte and the population doubling time on Tyrinte was 18.7%, 25.2% and 26.3% faster than those of individuals on other cultivars tested. The results obtained in this study indicated that Tyrinte appeared to be the most susceptible to the mealy plum aphid among the cultivars tested.

AB  - Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] landraces provide nutritional quality and security under the harsh environmental conditions of Rajasthan, India. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), this study investigated pearl millet genetic diversity patterns and related the results to farmers' local knowledge and seed systems. Thirty-nine cultivars were assessed: 14 farmer landraces from western Rajasthan, 13 farmer landraces from eastern Rajasthan, and 112 control cultivars. Shannons' information index for western (H = 0.34) and eastern (H = 0.32) Rajasthan landraces was up to 14% higher than in composite-based improved cultivars. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that variation within landrace populations was much higher than between regional samples. In the west, intra-village variation was higher than inter-village variation. In the east, variation between landrace groups bearing a specific name was higher than intra-group variation. Gene flow, inferred from genetic distances between populations, was used as an indicator for seed exchange between farmers. In western Rajasthan, seed exchange appears to be especially dynamic, as gene How was greater than N(e)m = 25 among most of its populations. Farmers' knowledge of local cultivars and seed systems was, for the most part, supported by the AFLP analysis. These results are relevant for in situ maintenance and breeding strategies with a view to improving traditional cultivars, specifically performance and yielding stability.

AB  - Vapor-filled polyethylene diffusion samplers (typically used to locate discharge zones of volatile organic compound contaminated ground water beneath streams and lakes) and water-filled polyethylene diffusion bag samplers (typically used to obtain volatile organic compound concentrations in ground-water at wells) were tested to determine compound selectivity, equilibration times, and sample stability. The aqueous concentrations of several volatile organic compounds obtained from within water-filled diffusion samplers closely matched concentrations in ambient water outside the samplers. An exception was methyl-tert-butyl ether, which was detectable, but not reliably quantifiable using the diffusion samplers. The samplers equilibrated to a variety of volatile organic compounds within 24 h for vapor-filled passive diffusion vial samplers and within 48 h for water-filled passive diffusion bag samplers. Under field conditions, however, a longer equilibration time may be required to account for environmental disturbances caused by sampler deployment. An equilibrium period for both vapor- and water-filled diffusion samplers of approximately 2 weeks probably is adequate for most investigations in sandy formations. Longer times may be required for diffusion-sampler equilibration in poorly permeable sediment. The vapor-filled samplers should be capped and water from the diffusion bag samplers should be transferred to sampling vials immediately upon recovery to avoid volatilization losses of the gasses.

AB  - Biomass, abundance, species composition of collembola, soil water content, and bulk density were investigated in four hop fields in Southern Bavaria.  For each soil type, one field was supplied only with mineral fertilizers, and the second was additionally cultivated with underseed (oil-seed rape) to provide a green manure.  Soils within and between rows were sampled separately over 2 years.  The highest biomass of collembola was found in the sandy soil with underseed, whereas the individual numbers were highest in the loamy soil with underseed.  In many cases total individual numbers and abundances of single species differed between soil types, green manure/mineral fertilization, and the sampling points (plant rows/rows between the plants).  There were significant but low negative correlations between individual numbers of single species and water content (except for Isotomurus palustris) or bulk density.  All results of this study were based on very common, widespread species.  It is concluded that species abundances of collembola, even if they are euryoecious, are good indicators of soil type and different environmental conditions within the same soil type.  The investigation of abundance and biomass showed that none of these parameters on its own was appropriate to compare populations either between or within the habitats investigated.  Since both individual numbers and the standing crop of a population are important for nutrient turnover, in studies dealing with element fluxes their comparative analysis is indispensable.

AB  - Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions occur during burial because sediments contain reactive mixtures of oxidised and reduced components. Diagenetic chemical reactions represent the approach of all sedimentary components toward equilibrium, and control the long-term stability of sedimentary iron-bearing minerals. Magnetic minerals are sensitive indicators of sedimentary redox conditions and of changes in these conditions through time, with diagenetic effects ranging from subtle to pervasive. Despite the importance of magnetic mineral diagenesis in paleomagnetism, rock magnetism, and environmental magnetism, and the usefulness of these subjects in the Earth and environmental sciences, there is no systematic single published treatment of magnetic mineral diagenesis. This paper is an attempt to provide such a treatment for the full range of diagenetic environments. Magnetic mineral diagenesis during early burial is driven largely by chemical changes associated with organic matter degradation in a succession of environments that range from oxic to nitrogenous to manganiferous to ferruginous to sulphidic to methanic, where the free energy yielded by different oxidants decreases progressively in each environment In oxic environments, the most important diagenetic processes involve surface oxidation of detrital minerals, and precipitation of Fe3+-bearing minerals from solution. In ferruginous environments, the most reactive detrital and authigenic iron oxides undergo dissolution, often mediated by dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria, which releases Fe2+ that becomes available for other reactions. The Fe2+ in solution can diffuse upward where it is oxidised to form new authigenic iron (oxyhydr-)oxide minerals or it can become bioavailable to enable magnetotactic bacteria to biomineralise magnetite, generally at the base of the overlying nitrogenous zone. Alternatively, dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria can produce extracellular magnetite within ferruginous environments. In sulphidic environments, iron-bearing detrital mineral assemblages undergo more radical alteration. Hydrogen sulphide, which is a byproduct of bacterial sulphate reduction or of anaerobic oxidation of methane, reacts with the Fe2+ released from iron mineral dissolution or directly with solid iron (oxyhydr-)oxide minerals to form iron sulphide minerals (mackinawite, greigite, and pyrite). Authigenic growth of ferrimagnetic greigite has important implications for paleomagnetic recording. Secondary iron sulphide formation can also occur as a result of anaerobic oxidation of methane. Methane migration through sediments in association with biogenic or thermogenic methane production or in association with gas hydrate dissociation can disrupt the diagenetic steady state and give rise to greigite and monoclinic pyrrhotite formation that remagnetises sediments. Most of the above-described diagenetic processes occur below 50 degrees C. With continuing burial above 50 degrees C, but at sub-metamorphic temperatures, magnetic minerals can undergo further thermally induced chemical changes that give rise to a wide range of mineralogical transformations that affect the magnetic record of the host sediment These changes include remagnetisations. Magnetic analysis can provide much valuable information concerning diagenesis in environmental processes. The range of processes discussed in this paper should assist researchers in analysing sediment magnetic properties for which the assessment of diagenetic effects has become a necessary component.

AB  - Land snails provide a unique opportunity to study terrestrial paleoenvironments because their shells, which are generally highly abundant and well-preserved in the fossil record, contain a temporal record of environmental change in the form of isotope codes. To evaluate the utility of this approach for a low-latitude oceanic setting, 207 modern shells of 18 species of land snail were analyzed for their oxygen and carbon isotope composition along a north and south facing altitudinal gradient (10-2160 m a.s.l.) in Tenerife Island (similar to 28 degrees N) of the Canary Archipelago.
   Shells collected at each locality showed a relatively large range in isotope composition which was greater along the south facing transect (drier and hotter), suggesting that the variance in shell isotope values may be related to water-stress. Although pooled isotope values did not generally show strong relationships with environmental variables (i.e., altitude, temperature and precipitation), mean isotope values were strongly associated with some climatic factors when grouped by site. The mean delta O-18 value of the shell (delta O-18(shell)) by site displayed a negative correlation with elevation, which is consistent with the positive relationship observed between temperature and the delta O-18 value of rain (delta O-18(rain)). Calculated delta O-18 values of the snail body water (delta O-18(body)) derived from observed temperatures and delta O-18(shell) values (using the equation of Grossman and Ku [Grossman E. L. and Ku T. L. (1986) Oxygen and carbon isotope fractionation in biogenic aragonite. Chen?. Geol. (Isotope Geosci. Sec.) 59, 59-74]) displayed a trend with respect to altitude that was similar to measured and hypothetical delta O-18 values for local rain water. The calculated delta O-18(body) values from the shell declined 0.17 parts per thousand (VSMOW) per 100 m, which is consistent with the "altitude effect" observed for tropical rains in Western Africa, and it correlated negatively with rainfall amount. Accordingly, lower delta O-18(shell) values indicate lower temperatures, lower delta O-18(rain) values and possibly, higher rainfall totals. A positive correlation between the mean delta C-13 values of shells (delta C-13(shell)) and plants by site suggests that shells potentially record information about the surrounding vegetation. The delta C-13(shell) values varied between -15.7 and -0.67 parts per thousand (VPDB), indicating that snails consumed C-3 and C-4/CAM plants, where more negative delta C-13(shell) values probably reflects the preferential consumption of C-3 plants which are favored under wetter conditions. Individuals with more positive delta O-13(shell) values consumed a larger percentage of C-4 plants (other potential factors such as carbonate ingestion or atmospheric CO2 contribution were unlikely) that were more common at lower elevations of the hotter and drier south facing transect. The relatively wide range of shell isotope values within a single site requires the analysis of numerous shells for meaningful paleoclimatic studies. Although small differences were observed in isotope composition among snail species collected at a single sampling site, they were not significant, suggesting that isotope signatures extracted from multi-taxa snail data sets may be used to infer environmental conditions over a broad range of habitats.

AB  - Relocating activities along the fringe, re-designing economic functions, and re-modelling settlement structures across larger regions and broader spatial scales, reflect the inherent shift toward complex metropolitan systems. A refined understanding of urban change requires the adoption of a 'complex thinking' that focuses on adaptive behaviour of key agents and local development networks within highly volatile real estate markets. By linking ecology with regional science, our study investigates speed and spatial direction of building activity rates introducing original indicators of urban growth and an exploratory multivariate statistics of the evolving socioeconomic context in the Athens' region, Greece. Having experienced spatially uncoordinated growth that often resulted in self-organised settlements and socially diversified neighbourhoods, Athens was a paradigmatic example of complex metropolitan systems in Europe. The empirical findings of our study identify non-linear stages of the metropolitan cycle supporting the assumption that long-term urban expansion is a recursive process, with irregular accelerations and decelerations, and a complex relationship between spatial and temporal dimensions. Urban transformations are associated with a broad spectrum of socioeconomic conditions. While playing a variable role over the last century, the most relevant factors in Athens' growth include population dynamics, urban concentration, and wealth accumulation. Considering such dynamics, spatial planning is required to give adaptive responses to discontinuous socioeconomic development increasingly dependent on territorial aspects and environmental constraints.

AB  - Low Impact Development practices (LID) as alternative measures of urban drainage can be used within the approach of resources recycling and co-management. This study evaluates the potential contribution of a bioretention system to flood control, non-potable water demands (NPD) and resources co-management. Bioretention setups were tested experimentally under variable conditions to identify operational key-factors to multiple purposes. Additionally, the efficiencies obtained for laboratory scale were extrapolated for household and watershed scale, quantifying the indicators of water demand reduction (WDR), energy demand reduction (EDR) and carbon emission reduction (CER) for hybrid systems with LID. The laboratory results indicated that the use of a bioretention with a submerged zone can improve the quality of the water recovered for reuse, while maintaining the efficiency of runoff retention and peak flow attenuation. Comparing the bioretention effluent quality with the Brazilian standards for stormwater reuse, the parameters color, turbidity, E. coli and metals were above the limits, indicating the necessity of a better treatment to solids particles and disinfection. Expanding the analysis to watershed scale, the bioretention helped to reduce NPD demands up to 45%, leading to a reduction in energy demand and carbon emission from the centralized water supply system.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution becomes a research hotspot and many studies focus on threats of MPs, but few have integrated multi-level indicators to assess response to MPs of organisms. Here we exposed guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to MPs (polystyrene; 32-40 mu m diameter) with two concentrations (100 and 1000 mu g/L) for 28 days. We found that higher accumulation of MPs appeared in guppy gill than that in gut. MPs had no obvious effect on guppy growth but significantly inhibited the condition factor. Oxidative stress presented in guppy viscera with activated antioxidants. The decline of Na+/K+-ATP activity in guppy indicated that MPs might interfere with the osmotic balance of gills. MPs reduced body molar ratio of C:N and delta C-13 value, but no apparent impact on delta N-15. It implied that MPs probably altered elemental transition. Eventually, through integrated biomarkers response index (IBR) of guppy, we found that catalase activity was the highest index in response to MPs, and the response of growth performance to MPs was lower than that of oxidative stress and element alteration. Risks of MPs aggravated in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggested that multi-level IBR approach should be adopted to quantify effects of MPs on aquatic organisms, especially on fish.

AB  - Biomarkers are fossil organic molecules that contain information about either the precursor organisms or the environmental conditions that generated petroleum. They become useful tools to establish stratigraphic correlations, assess the depositional environment, and even check the history of organic matter. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) is considered nearly indispensable when nitrogen-, oxygen-, or sulfur-containing (NSO) biomarker compounds need to be explored. In this contribution, we present an integrated study performed over 33 crude oils from the Putumayo Basin, Colombia. On the basis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry traditional analysis, we provide an interpretation outline built on classic hydrocarbon biomarkers. These outcomes allowed for establishing no biodegradation in most of the samples. Samples were grouped on the basis of whether the ratio Pr/Ph was higher or lower than 1 and further correlated with the abundance of oxygen compounds (classes O-1 and O-2) detected by negative ion electrospray ionization [(-) ESI] FT-ICR MS. In addition, saturate biomarkers allowed for validation of NSO parameters to sort crude oils according to their respective reservoirs, something crucial for production tests in new wells. The obtained results allowed for the correlation of the polar compound geochemistry to the influences of the source facies, depositional environment, and reservoir lithology of the Putumayo Basin.

AB  - Central Asian grasslands are extensively used for pastoral livestock grazing. This traditional land use is nowadays characterized by intensifying grasslands into more productive pastures. This change affects biodiversity and diminishes grasslands' ecological role. Biodiversity impacts are probably also exacerbated by climate change. These changes in biodiversity are poorly studied in Central Asia. Here, we estimated potential biodiversity changes in the Central Asian grasslands using the latest shared socio-economic pathways and the representative concentration pathways (i.e., SSP-RCP scenario framework). We selected scenarios with contrasting socio-economic and climate conditions (i.e., SSP1-RCP4.5, SSP3-RCP8.5, SSP4-RCP4.5, and SSP5-RCP8.5) and further detailed the land-use scenarios for the region using stakeholders' input. We indicated future biodiversity by the mean species abundance indicator. The contrasting scenario combinations showed that grasslands' biodiversity will decline under each scenario. The strongest impact on biodiversity is expected in SSP5-RCP8.5, where half of the grasslands are likely to lose most of their local originally occurring species by 2100. The lowest impact is expected in SSP4-RCP4.5. Our study stresses the potential vulnerability of this region to increasing land-use intensity and climate change. These impact projections can help regional decision makers to develop and implement better biodiversity-conservation and sustainable management policies for these grasslands.

AB  - The purpose of the work is to base the selection of adequate tools of state support for the development of old industrial regions the territories on which the industries related to the "outgoing" technological structures are concentrated. It is shown that the complexity of the tools selection aimed at ensuring the economic security of old industrial regions is reasoned by the heterogeneity of their composition. With the application of key postulates of synergetics it is justified that the tools of state support for regional development are most effective if they are used at the bifurcation point. It is argued that the bifurcation state is characterized by an increase in threats to the sustainable functioning and development of the regional socio-economic system and a decrease in the level of economic security in the region. A system of indicators for assessing the economic security state of old industrial territories was proposed, by using of which the nature of their development was diagnosed and it was argued that the regions are instable and objectively need government support in order to reach the trajectory of sustainable socio-economic dynamics. The importance of such selection is proved and as a condition to ensure the success of the transition process carried out by the region the toolkit of differentiated state policy for the development of old industrial regions is proposed.

AB  - China's electric power industry has experienced a reform whereby the generation sector is being opened up to competition but the transmission and distribution sectors are still under regulation. Efficiency and benchmarking analyses are widely used for improving the performance of regulated segments. The impact of observable environmental factors, together with unobservable characteristics, on efficiency has gained increasing attention in recent years. This study uses alternative stochastic frontier models combined with input distance functions to measure the productive efficiency of 29 grid firms of China over the period of 1993-2014 and investigates whether the observed environmental and unobserved heterogeneity factors affect the productive efficiency. The results indicate that adverse environmental conditions may bring negative influence to the production of grid utilities while the number of customers and the network length have positive impacts on the utilities' efficiency; Besides, the efficiency is sensitive to the model specification, which illustrates the presence of observed and unobserved heterogeneity; Moreover, there is no significant efficiency improvement in the grid utilities after the unbundling reform of 2002; Finally, the regional grids differ significantly in efficiency, and there is room for improvement, which could be achieved by incentive regulation taking due account of environmental heterogeneity.

AB  - Spatial expansions can provide a false sense of sustainability to fish markets and their consumers who perceive stable landings through time despite localized depletions. This study examined attributes of monthly landings and changes in size structures within a commercial coral-reef fishery that had stable landings for 11years. Regression models revealed a significant rise in the ratio of landings between calm and windy months, depicting that stable landings were driven by increased fishing effort or success during the calmer months when less exploited reefs became accessible. Within the calmer months, race-to-fish dynamics also evolved for some target species, such as parrotfishes, whose landings became increasingly concentrated towards the onset of calmfavorable conditions. During this same time, the size structure for 15 out of 19 target species that comprised 60% of annual landings decreased. The cumulative results suggested that (1) spatial management units can be improved by taking environmental gradients that define fishing access into consideration, and (2) thresholds for size-and-age-based policies should be established with respect to life-history parameters that maximize cohort production andprotect against declining size structures. Both recommendations resonate with traditional forms of management across the Pacific that were based on reef tenure and knowledge of how species respond to fishing pressure.

AB  - AimThe spoilage potential of 28 bacterial strains isolated from spoiled raw yellowfin tuna was evaluated.
   Methods and ResultsBacterial species were inoculated in irradiated tuna matrix. Chemical changes, bacterial growth and sensory quality were monitored during aerobic storage at 8 degrees C. Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia hermanii had no spoiling effect. Brochothrix thermosphacta and Carnobacterium divergens/maltaromaticum developed moderate unpleasant odours. Hafnia paralvei and Serratia spp. released strong off-odours (pyrrolidine, sulphur/cabbage). No bacterial group (except H. paralvei) combined with Pseudomonas spp. deteriorated the sensory quality of tuna. When C. divergens/maltaromaticum was associated with H. paralvei or B. thermosphacta, the odour is close to the naturally contaminated tuna stored on the same conditions. The pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) and trimethylamine (TMA) were not correlated with the spoilage.
   ConclusionsThe bacterial species had a different impact on the sensory quality of the fish. The bacterial interactions lead to an enhancement or an inhibition of the spoilage potential and the bacterial growth.
   Significance and Impact of StudyThe specific spoilage organism (SSO) appears to be an association of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with Enterobacteriaceae or B. thermosphacta. Pseudomonas, often dominant at the sensory rejection time, is not a good quality indicator.

AB  - Sponges are one of the most ancient animal phyla with about 8850 living species and about 5000 described fossil taxa. Most sponges are marine and live at all depths of all oceans. Freshwater bodies (lakes, rivers) are inhabited only by a small minority of species, ca. 240 (< 3%) comprising the order Spongillida (Demospongiae) most of which are able to produce specialized resting bodies to survive harsh terrestrial environmental conditions. This highly disproportionate ratio of marine and freshwater sponges is even more accentuated in the field of palaeontology with rare records reported up to the Miocene (< 0.4% of all known fossil sponges). Only a few fossil taxa were correctly supported by strong and convincing taxonomic morphotraits at genus and species level, thus we provide here an overview of fossil freshwater sponges focusing on their morphotraits and distribution in time and space. Each recorded taxon is described in detail following the modem taxonomy and nomenclature. All fossil data suggest a clear trend of long term conservative morphology in the evolutionary history of Spongillida, although some traits of Recent gemmules evolved in a wide array of adaptive morpho-functional novelties. The majority of accepted fossil species belongs to the cosmopolitan family Spongillidae. The genera Oncosclera and Potamophloios of the family Potamolepidae seem to have had, in the past, a much larger geographic range than today. A synthesis of fossil taxa morphotraits is also provided in an Appendix 1.

AB  - The Great Spotted Woodpecker provides important information about the status of a forest in terms of structure and age. As a primary cavity creator, it provides small-medium size cavities for passerines. However, despite its interest as an ecosystem engineer, studies of this species in Africa are scarce. Here, spatially explicit predictive models were used to investigate how forest structural variables are related to both the Great Spotted Woodpecker and secondary cavity nesting birds in Maamora cork oak forest (northwest Morocco). A positive association between Great Spotted Woodpecker and both dead-tree density and large mature trees (>60 cm dbh) was found. This study area, Maamora, has an old-growth forest structure incorporating a broad range of size and condition of live and dead trees, favouring Great Spotted Woodpecker by providing high availability of foraging and excavating sites. Secondary cavity nesting birds, represented by Great Tit, African Blue Tit, and Hoopoe, were predicted by Great Spotted Woodpecker detections. The findings suggest that the conservation of the Maamora cork oak forest could be key to maintaining these hole-nesting birds. However, this forest is threatened by forestry practises and livestock overgrazing and the challenge is therefore to find sustainable management strategies that ensure conservation while allowing its exploitation.

AB  - Background: Chlorophyll content decreases in plants under stress conditions, therefore it is used commonly as an indicator of plant health. Arabidopsis thaliana offers a convenient and fast way to test physiological phenotypes of mutations and treatments. However, chlorophyll measurements with conventional solvent extraction are not applicable to Arabidopsis leaves due to their small size, especially when grown on culture dishes.
   Results: We provide a nondestructive method for chlorophyll measurement whereby the red, green and blue (RGB) values of a color leaf image is used to estimate the chlorophyll content from Arabidopsis leaves. The method accommodates different profiles of digital cameras by incorporating the ColorChecker chart to make the digital negative profiles, to adjust the white balance, and to calibrate the exposure rate differences caused by the environment so that this method is applicable in any environment. We chose an exponential function model to estimate chlorophyll content from the RGB values, and fitted the model parameters with physical measurements of chlorophyll contents. As proof of utility, this method was used to estimate chlorophyll content of G protein mutants grown on different sugar to nitrogen ratios.
   Conclusion: This method is a simple, fast, inexpensive, and nondestructive estimation of chlorophyll content of Arabidopsis seedlings. This method lead to the discovery that G proteins are important in sensing the C/N balance to control chlorophyll content in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination technology with the use of recovered photovoltaic (PV) thermal energy could be viable for the production of small-capacity sustainable water and improvement of PV electric power generation efficiency. This paper investigates the technical feasibility and environmental friendliness of an air-cooled PV system integrated with ambient seawater inflow into a HDH desalination system. The technical analysis of the PV-HDH desalination process was carried out through the modeling of the physical and thermodynamic properties involved in the recovery of PV thermal energy and determination of the effect of this recovery on water produced under the environmental conditions of Abu Dhabi, UAE. The results showed that the heat recovered from the PV resulted in the production of a daily average of 2.28 L of fresh water per m(2) of PV. On the other hand, the environmental impact assessment of this PV-HDH power and desalination technology was also carried out for the first time in order to determine its viability for small-scale sustainable water and energy production. The PV-HDH system resulted in 83.6% decrease in environmental impacts when compared with PV-Reverse Osmosis (PV-RO) system. In conclusion, the integrated PV-HDH desalination technology is promising and expected to play a key role in the field of water desalination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - High rates of inorganic nitrogen (N) deposition or internal N turnover increases the risks of N loss from forests with negative effects on stream water quality. We hypothesized that soil fungi may be more important N sinks than bacteria, and thus examined the impact of soil microbial community composition on N leaching from forests. We studied 19 spruce stands to examine relationships between microbial community composition, stem growth, soil-, and lysimeter-collected soil solution characteristics, and N leaching. We used nitrate concentration in the soil solution below the rooting zone as an N leaching index and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis for characterisation of microbial communities. Microbial community composition in the organic horizon and soil solution chemistry below the rooting zone was highly correlated. Stands with low concentrations of nitrate (NO3 (-)) and aluminium (Al) had higher fungi: bacteria ratio compared with stands with higher concentrations of NO3 (-) and Al. Stem growth and fungi: bacteria ratio explained 70 % of the variation in N and Al leaching. We identified three microbial predictors of variation in soil solution chemistry, of which the fungi: bacteria was the strongest. The other two were putative indicators of microbial C limitation, a condition known to stimulate N mineralisation and nitrification.

AB  - Funding programmes for European cohesion policy are a crucial tool to support the sustainability goals of the European Union and national policies of its member states. All these funding programmes require a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to enhance sustainable development. This article compares five first SEA applications at cohesion policy level to discuss challenges, limitations and benefits of this instrument. In order to support the SEA-process a "Handbook on SEA for Cohesion Policy 2007-13" (GRDP 2006) was developed. The paper examines the special requirements and challenges at the programme level given the special conditions for stakeholder involvement, integration of SEA in the programme development process and strategies to cope with uncertainties to ensure real compatibility with policy goals. Using action research and in-depth interviews with SEA planners and programme managers enabled us to analyse the suitability of the methodology proposed by the handbook. The results show that some recommendations of the handbook should be changed in order to increase the transparency and to enhance the standard and comparability of the SEA-documents.
   Overall the SEA proved to be a rather successful tool for the integration of sustainability goals at the EU and national policy levels. Its particular strengths emerged as the process makes uncertainties visible and leads to possible redefinitions while maintaining actual policy goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The responses of leaf spectral reflectance of Fraxinus mandshurica saplings to above- and belowground competition were studied under field conditions in a temperate forest near the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in northeast China. Two sets of four treatments, each inducing different levels of competition, were applied under the shade of the forest canopy and in a clear felling area under full light exposure. The heights of the saplings were measured once a month and leaf reflectance was measured at the same time. At the end of the experiment, all target saplings were excavated, and their biomass and root morphological traits were analysed. All these traits were then compared with the leaf spectral reflectance values and different spectral indices. We found that changes in height and biomass were significantly affected by the treatment and site, and that the differences between the four treatments coincided well with the differences in the spectral indices. The final biomass and all root morphological attributes were significantly affected by the treatment and site. Again, these differences corresponded well with the differences in the spectral indices and the spectral reflectance curves. In conclusion, we found that leaf spectral reflectance was sensitive to competition and showed a close relation with other responses, which makes it a reliable indicator of the response of F. mandshurica to varying competition intensities, especially when competition is very severe.

AB  - Field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis) is one of the 10 most problematic weeds in the world. Its control using chemical herbicides is not completely effective. Aceria malherbae is a mite used successfully as a biological agent to control field bindweed. Effective implementation of this kind of biocontrol requires high-quality production of these mites. The purpose of this study was to investigate different quality indicators for effectively rearing A. malherbae under greenhouse conditions. The indicators considered were number of gallmites (adults, immature stages, and eggs), number of developed stems per plant, and number of galls per stem. We used 25 plots with 10 pots per plot, testing a sub-sample from one-fourth of these pots. The Shewhart chart or process-behavior chart was applied to determine basic statistics (means and range) and acceptance and rejection limits. Rejection limits for inferior plots were set at 3.9 developed stems per plant, 5.2 galls per stem, 7.4 adults, 32 nymphs, and 11 eggs, per plot. We also propose for quality control that the number of developed stems per plant and the number of galls per stem be routinely counted to detect any reduced quality of mite production. The results suggest that these indicators could be used for assessing quality control in large-scale reproduction of A. malherbae.

AB  - This study analyses the ecological and syntaxonomical characteristics of the juniper sibiricae -Pinetum dalmaticae Domac (1956) 1965 association. This association is present only on higher altitudes of Biokovo Mountain situated on the eastern Adriatic coast. With its highest peak at an altitude of 1,762 m, Biokovo is one of the hotspots of plant endemism in Croatia. It is highly influenced by the Mediterranean climate which is expressed up to the higher parts of the mountain, although, due to its height, it has weakened montane and alpine conditions on the peaks. According to the present syntaxonomical solution, the researched association belongs to the sub-mediterranean alliance Ostryo-Carpinion orientalis in the Quercetalia pubescentis order in the Querco-Fagetea class. Numerical and syntaxonomical analyses suggest that Junipero sibiricae -Pinetum dalmaticae on Biokovo differs from all other Dalmatian pine vegetation types. Cluster analysis, Indicator species analysis together with Nonmetric multidimensional scaling used to compare it to forests dominated by Pinus nigra s.l. from other Mediterranean areas (Greece, Iberian peninsula, Corsica and Sicily) suggested it should be classified in the Pino-Juniperetea class, the Juniperetalia haemisphaericae order, and the eastern Mediterranean Berberido craeticae-Juniperion foetidissimae alliance. The resemblance of Junipero sibiricae -Pinetum dalmaticae with eastern Mediterranean associations and its inclusion into mentioned syntaxa is confirmed phytosociologically and ecologically.

AB  - In many animals, including humans, the ability of females to reproduce depends not only on their survival to each age but also on being pair-bonded to a mate. Exposure of the genetic variation underlying fecundity to natural selection should therefore depend on the proportion of females both alive and pair-bonded. In spite of this, female "marital" status is seldom considered to impact the strength of selection on age-specific fecundity. We used marriage-history data of preindustrial Finns who experienced conditions of natural mortality and fertility to investigate how assortative mating by age and socioeconomic status affected female fitness and underlay age-specific female marriage patterns. The probability that a female was married peaked at age 30-40 years; females who married in their early 20s to high-socioeconomic-status husbands had the highest levels of lifetime reproductive success. Greater age difference between the pair, which is typical for females who are married to high-socioeconomic-status husbands, increased the likelihood of widowhood occurring premenopause, adding to declines in the proportion of genetic variation exposed to selection with age. Using the age schedule of female marriage, we present an indicator of selection intensity on within-pair-bond fecundity. Our results suggest that the decline in selection intensity after age 30 years is a factor in the evolutionary maintenance of female reproductive senescence and menopause.

AB  - The development of particular analytical methods like laser ablation-inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) renders it possible to determine the composition of a single chamber of foraminifers tests. This is crucial in the investigation of benthic foraminifers since the growth of new chambers under laboratory conditions does not face the difficulties associated with experiments involving reproduction. The addition of chambers can be recognized by the incorporation of the fluorescent dye calcein. When added to the culture medium, previously formed chambers are not affected, and calcein is only incorporated in calcite that is formed in its presence. However, it has never been verified whether calcein affects the element incorporation into foraminiferal calcite. In order to investigate and quantify possible effects, specimens of the benthic foraminifer Ammonia tepida were cultured in the presence and absence of calcein (15 degrees C, salinity 33), and Mg and Sr in newly formed chambers were analyzed with LA-ICP-MS. Magnesium concentrations of cross sections and longitudinal sections of foraminifera from the same experiment were also analyzed by electron microprobe measurements. Additionally, the impact of calcein on Mg and Sr incorporation in inorganically precipitated calcium carbonate crystals was quantified. Results show that presence of calcein does not impact the incorporation of Mg and Sr into biologically and inorganically precipitated calcium carbonate.

AB  - Bacillus atrophaeus's spores are used as biological indicators to monitor sterilization processes and as a Bacillus anthracis surrogate in the development and validation of biosafety methods. The regular use of biological indicators to evaluate the efficiency of sterilization processes is a legal requirement for health services. However, its high cost hinders its widespread use. Aiming at developing a cost-effective inoculum medium, soybean molasses and nutrient-supplemented vinasse were evaluated for their effectiveness in solid-state fermentation (SSF). In biomass production, the results demonstrated that all tested compositions favor growth by providing the nutritional demands of the microorganism. Optimum casein peptone and soybean molasses concentration (1.0%, 2.5%, or 4.0%) was determined by a 2((2-0)) factorial experimental design. The results have showed a positive influence of peptone on biomass production. In order to define peptone final concentration (4.0% or 6.0%), a 2(2) factorial experimental design was used. An optimized medium containing 4.0% soybean molasses and 4.0% casein peptone was similar in performance to a synthetic control medium (tryptone soy broth) in dry-heat thermal-resistant spore production by SSF. An experiment performed under optimum SSF conditions resulted in 1.9 x 10(10) CFU g(-1) dry matter with D-160 degrees C = 5.2 +/- 0.2 min.

AB  - Relative growth rate (RGR) is a fundamental trait for comparative plant ecology but cannot be measured in situ, leading to problems in interpreting vegetation function. However, the components of RGR ( net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf weight ratio (LWR), and specific leaf area (SLA)) can be calculated for wild plants from morphological measurements ( leaf area, leaf dry mass, whole plant dry mass), which potentially reflect RGR. Seeds of 19 species from Italian prealpine calcareous grasslands were collected and seedlings were cultivated under controlled conditions. RGR, NAR, LAR, LWR and SLA were analysed. The results demonstrated that RGR was positively correlated with SLA and LAR (p < 0.01). Furthermore, LAR was positively correlated with LWR and negatively with NAR (p < 0.05). Monocotyledons showed significantly higher LAR, LWR and NAR than dicotyledons, as the latter allocated a greater proportion of biomass to stems, but RGR and SLA showed no such phylogenetic constraint. Therefore SLA is the most reliable indicator of RGR in ecological and functional surveys of prealpine calcareous grasslands, and has the additional advantage that it can be measured from leaf material alone. Lower mean RGR and SLA for calcareous grassland species suggests that this vegetation is less likely to recover from the effects of disturbance than meadows and dry meadows.

AB  - In life cycle assessment (LCA) of solar PV systems, energy pay back time (EPBT) is the commonly used indicator to justify its primary energy use. However, EPBT is a function of competing energy sources with which electricity from solar PV is compared, and amount of electricity generated from the solar PV system which varies with local irradiation and ambient conditions. Therefore, it is more appropriate to use site-specific EPBT for major decision-making in power generation planning. LCA and life cycle cost analysis are performed for a distributed 2.7 kW(p) grid-connected monocrystalline solar PV system operating in Singapore. This paper presents various EPBT analyses of the solar PV system with reference to a fuel oil-fired steam turbine and their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs are also compared. The study reveals that GHG emission from electricity generation from the solar PV system is less than one-fourth that from an oil-fired steam turbine plant and one-half that from a gas-fired combined cycle plant. However, the cost of electricity is about five to seven times higher than that from the oil or gas fired power plant. The environmental uncertainties of the solar PV system are also critically reviewed and presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Group II introns are mobile retroelements that invade their cognate intron-minus gene in a process known as retrohoming. They can also retrotranspose to ectopic sites at low frequency. Previous studies of the Lactococcus lactis intron Ll.LtrB indicated that in its native host, as in Escherichia coli, retrohoming occurs by the intron RNA reverse splicing into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) through an endonuclease-dependent pathway. However, in retrotransposition in L. lactis, the intron inserts predominantly into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), in an endonuclease-independent manner. This work describes the retrotransposition of the Ll.LtrB intron in E. coli, using a retrotransposition indicator gene previously employed in our L. lactis studies. Unlike in L. lactis, in E. coli, Ll.LtrB retrotransposed frequently into dsDNA, and the process was dependent on the endonuclease activity of the intron-encoded protein. Further, the endonuclease-dependent insertions preferentially occurred around the origin and terminus of chromosomal DNA replication. Insertions in E. coli can also occur through an endonuclease-independent pathway, and, as in L. lactis, such events have a more random integration pattern. Together these findings show that Ll.LtrB can retrotranspose through at least two distinct mechanisms and that the host environment influences the choice of integration pathway. Additionally, growth conditions affect the insertion pattern. We propose a model in which DNA replication, compactness of the nucleoid and chromosomal localization influence target site preference.

AB  - Practical and accurate microbial assessment of environmental systems is predicated on the detection and quantification of various microbial parameters in complex matrices. Traditional growth-based assays, considered to be both slow and biased, are increasingly being replaced by optical detection methods such as flow cytometry. Flow cytometry (FCM) offers high-speed multi-parametric data acquisition, compatibility with current molecular-based microbial detection technologies, and is a proven technology platform. The unique technical properties of flow cytometry have allowed the discrimination of bacteria based on nucleic acid staining, microbial identification based on genomic and immunologic characteristics, and determination of cell viability. For this technology to achieve the ultimate goal of monitoring the microbial ecology of distributed systems, it will be necessary to develop a fully functional, low cost, and networkable microsystem platform capable of rapid detection of multiple species of microorganisms simultaneously under realistic environmental conditions. One such microsystem, miniaturized and integrated in accordance with recent advances in micro-electromechanical systems technology, is named the Micro Integrated Flow Cytometer. This manuscript is a minireview of the current status and future prospects for environmental application of flow cytometry in general, and micro-flow cytometry in particular.

AB  - With the aim of determining a good selection of coniferous species for the establishment of cultures, the Forest Research Institute in Jastrebarsko began research work in 1960. Trial planting comprised three indigenous and three foreign species. The indigenous species included a Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Black pine (Pinus nigra A r n.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies K a r s t.), and the foreign species were European Larch (Larix decidua M i l l.), Weymouth pine (Pines strobus L.) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. viridis F r a n c o). These arc economically the most interesting coniferous species that arc often used in Croatia for establishing new cultures in non-forested areas and for reconstruction of lower quality stands of broadleaves. In spring of 1969 three comparative trials were established in three ecologically characteristic forest regions of Republic of Croatia.
   A necessary condition for successful production could simply be expressed in this way: "The right species in the right place". It can be achieved when the basic indicators of productive ability of stands as well as bio-ecologic traits of the species are known. An absolute success may be expected only in the cultures where the highest degree of harmonisation of species requirements regarding stands has been obtained. This paper shows the results of the 32-year development of plants of the aforementioned species.

AB  - Continuous lake sediment records are increasingly important for a detailed reconstruction of Holocene paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions. Currently a variety of biotic, isotopic and biochemical proxies are routinely applied in multidisciplinary reconstructions, to compensate for deficits of individual analytical approaches. High-resolution records that can show evidence for environmental change on centennial or decadal scales require the analysis of small-sized samples of only a few grams or less, which often limits the application of multiple techniques on one discrete sample. Here, we describe a novel procedure for sequential analysis of molecular biomarkers and subsequent determination of pollen distribution on a single, small sediment sample. Lipids were efficiently recovered from freeze-dried sediment using organic solvent mixtures of dichloromethane in hexane (1 :5, v/v) or a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol (1:1, v/v) via accelerated solvent extraction at 100degreesC and 75 bar pressure. Solvent extraction was shown to have no effect on pollen preservation, including surface microstructure study by scanning electron microscopy analysis, or pollen distribution. Sample amounts of 5.1, 3.6 and 1.1 g that were processed in triplicate gave identical results for pollen and molecular biomarker distribution. The analytical approach is applicable to high-resolution studies where very small amounts of only I g of sample material are available. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose, This study is an evaluation of a fluorometric, test using alamar Blue reagent in the performance of drug screening tests for Candida spp. and hyphal forms of Aspergillus fumigatus,
   Material and methods. After standardization of the alamar Blue method, the reference antifungal drugs, amphotericin B, fluconazole, 5-fluorocytosine and itraconazole were used to assess the alamar Blue screening test compared to the reference microdilution methods recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard and to a spectrophotometric method using a tetrazolium salt. Application was illustrated with new azole compounds and natural extracts.
   Results. Conclusion. The standardization of the fluorometric method allowed us to define testing conditions for Candida spp. and for Aspergillus fumigatus in terms of inoculum quantity, incubation time, fluorescent indicator volume and contact time. This method led to minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in good agreement with those obtained by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard reference methods for amphotericin B, fluconazole and 5-fluorocytosine on Candida spp., and also for amphotericin B and itraconazole on Aspergillus fumigatus. Furthermore, applied to our research activities, the test allowed the selection of one imidazolylindol propanol compound with a MIC of 0.001 mug/mL on Candida albicans. In conclusion this study demonstrated that our alamar Blue method was suitable for antifungal drug screening.

AB  - Land management and land-use planning in a forested country such as Papua New Guinea, which is subject to various anthropogenic pressures, requires an accurate mapping of forest-cover disturbances. The central hypothesis of this study was that remote sensing indicators of forest-cover conditions can be used to measure and map the impact of long-term forest-cover disturbances. This was tested with single year NOAA's Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer sensor (AVHRR) data at 1.1 km resolution. First, an ordinal scale of forest-cover disturbance was defined from field observations, a set of thematic maps and high spatial resolution satellite sensor data. Secondly, we analysed the relationship between the forest-cover disturbance scale and several biophysical indicators derived from AVHRR data at two seasons. Thirdly, a statistical analysis identified the optimal combination of biophysical indicators and observation dates to discriminate between the forest disturbance levels defined previously. A forest cover disturbance map was then produced over part of Papua New Guinea. Finally, a regionalization of the study area in terms of aggregate degree of disturbance was produced and the spatial patterns of forest disturbances were interpreted for each region in terms of broad processes of forest-cover change. The overall accuracy of the forest cover disturbance map was 79%. Nine regions, homogeneous in regard to the distribution and spatial pattern of disturbance categories, were identified.

AB  - Since 1987, the "brown ring" disease caused by a Vibrio pathogenic bacterium, called PI, has been affecting the cultivated Japanese clam, Ruditapes philippiranum, of French Atlantic coasts. Laboratory experiments of contaminated animals show that 92% of the starved clams and only 60% of the fed clams are diseased. The mortality attributable to the Vibrio is decreased by 40% in the fed animals. The nutrition should be a protection against the bacterial action. A comparative study of digestive diverticula in healthy and infested animals brings more information on the digestive stages of the tubules. Study of the ratios of the tubular lumen area to the whole section of the digestive tubules permits determination of a standard graduation of the digestive stages. The proportions of the tubular stages Vary according to the animal's condition. In an infested animal, the ratio of the degenerative stages trebles while the absorptive stage disappears. The starved or infected animals show similar digestive stages while in the controls, the proportions of the absorptive stage increase and stages 3 and 4 decrease in the presence of food. The digestive cycle is altered and the digestive diverticula passes into a state of degeneration. The establishment of this technique could allow automatic visualization of the state of the digestive diverticula in natural or reared clams.

AB  - In Egypt, organic-rich sediments in the Duwi and Dakhla Formations of the Campanian-Danian age are customarily assigned as "oil shale" that occupies the middle latitudes of the country but may extend southward to Kurkur Oases. This oil shale belt has a vast worldwide extension, and it is considered as major oil-and gas-prone source rock in many places, especially in the Middle East. The sedimentation of the oil shale was triggered by the major transgression event that occurred during the Late Cretaceous. The lithology, type of kerogen, organic richness, and thickness of these organic-rich sediments vary markedly both on lateral and vertical scales. In Quseir area, the in-place geological reserves, of oil shale of the 800-kcal/kg quality, is estimated to be more than 9 billion tons that can produce 5.48 bbls equivalent upon retorting. Very optimistic resources are expected in the unexplored Nile Valley region. The factor analysis of data rank representing 1176 core samples and analysis of 58 major and trace elements besides Rock-Eval analyses point to five main controlling factors that control deposition of oil shale. The terrestrial indicators Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, and K2O and the marine indicators Ca and Sr are oppositely loaded in the first factor. The second factor expresses the reducing conditions that prevailed during the deposition of the organic-rich marine environments. The euxinity of the basin is recognized by the third factor where sulfide and vanadium seem to be mutual. The fourth factor expresses the role of dolomitization while the fifth factor points to the humble role of oxidation. Considering the metric core samples, the highest TOC content recorded in the borehole drilled in Abu Tartur plateau is 3.6%, but it is about 14% for Quseir area. Regarding the spot samples in Quseir area, the highest TOC measured about 24%. It is not only the low TOC in Abu Tartur but also the kerogen type that is of type II + III, mostly of terrestrial origin (gas-prone) and lithology dominated by argillites. Organic richness is remarkable in Quseir-Safaga area, where the average TOC of 160-m-thick sequence is about 5%, with kerogen of type I or mixed I + II, mostly of marine origin (oil prone). The Dakhla Formation (Maastrichtian-Danian) is the richest in organic matter while Quseir Formation (Campanian) has the least organic richness and lowest kerogen quality. Detailed investigation on biomarkers confirms the relations among transgression, organic richness, kerogen type, and anoxic conditions. The organic matter is immature as witnessed by the low S1 values (<5%, in average), the low T-max (<430 degrees C), the low vitrinite reflectance (<0.4%), and biomarker signature. The variation in the S1 values between 1 and 9% is attributed to the influence of tectonics associating the Red Sea rift. In Quseir-Safaga area, there are particular prolific horizons of oil shale that seem to be visible for utilization by different technologies of combustion and retorting. The content of the heavy metals and uranium, as well as the spent, is a significant benefit. The faulting, dragging, and steep tilting of beds in the Quseir-Safaga area shall remain a serious challenge for extensive utilization of the estimated in-place geological reserves.

AB  - Background: Measurements of testosterone, scrotal circumference and libido have a great value as indicators of onset of puberty, total semen production, semen quality, control of spermatogenesis, testicular state, pathological conditions of testes and the potential sub-fertility or infertility. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine relationship between levels of peripheral blood testosterone, sexual behavior, scrotal circumference and seminal parameters in crossbred rams.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Twelve crossbred and sexually mature rams(sic) consisting of three Arkharmerino x Moghani (AM x MG), three Baluchi x Moghani (BL x MG), and three Ghezel x Baluchi (GH x BL) and three Ghezel x Arkharmerino (GH x AM) were used in this study. The scrotal circumference (SC) was measured at monthly intervals. Every two weeks the 12 crossbred rams were evaluated for the degree of libido using three ovariectomized ewes. Sexual behavior of crossbred rams was evaluated in terms of (1) reaction time for the first and second ejaculate (2) time taken for the first and second ejaculate (3) number of mounts for the first and second ejaculation. Ram semen was collected by artificial vagina and blood samples were obtained via jugular vein. Soon after the collection, semen characteristics and testosterone plasma were assayed. For estimation of the relationship between genetic group and other indices, Statistical analyses were performed by One-way ANOVA and Bivariate correlation coefficient was used to calculate the correlations between testosterone by spermatozoa parameters and libido in each genetic group; P < 0.05 considered significant. The results showed that there were no significant differences between crossbred rams in terms of semen characteristics except for spermatozoa progressive motility, semen volume and pH. The highest level of plasma testosterone was recorded in GH x BL rams (7.12 +/- 1.87 ng/mL) and the lowest was for AM x MG genetic group (2.99 +/- 1.90 ng/mL). However, any significant difference wasn't observed among the four genetic groups about plasma testosterone. At the present study the mean values of scrotal circumference of Arkharmerino x Moghani were higher than other genetic groups (P < 0.05). Also scrotal circumference showed a positive correlation with reaction time for the second ejaculation, semen pH and spermatozoa concentration (P < 0.05).
   Discussion: The sexual activity of males is influenced by test conditions and the methods applied in tests can vary considerably, even within the same experiment for example with regard to test duration and number of males and females. Among libido indices, only a significant correlation was observed between reaction time for second ejaculate and scrotal circumference. A non-significant correlation was observed between plasma testosterone, concentration, and semen traits. These differences between various reports could be due to the season of the study, breed, age of rams and many other environmental factors. It could be concluded that testosterone profiles is not a notable factor for estimating the quality of crossbred rams spermatogenesis and sexual activity. In addition to the above points, the males should be examined for a number of different tests have been used to assess the fertility or performance of crossbred rams, including scrotal measurement, semen examination, libido testing, hormonal profile and the other examinations.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different controlled water regimes on the morphophysiological indicators, phenophases, and ideal cutting time of forage cacti clones grown in a semiarid environment. From 2016 to 2018, in the semi-arid region of Brazil, the Miuda (MIU), Orelha de Elefante Mexicana (OEM) and IPA Sertania (IPA) clones were submitted to three regimes (40%, 80% and 120% ETc, where ETc is crop evapotranspiration) and to rainfed conditions (0% ETc). Cladode area index and the dry matter yield (DM) were used for calculating the morphophysiological indices. The cladode emission aided in delimiting the phenophases and, based on the DM accumulation, defined the ideal time for cutting the crop. The OEM clone excelled in terms of dry matter accumulation with a maximum value of 0.0441 Mg ha(-1) degrees Cday(-1). The water regimes above 80% ETc rise the number of phenophases in MIU and IPA clones. Cultivating forage cactus under water regime up to 40% ETc for OEM (895 degrees Cday) and 80% ETc for MIU and IPA (737 degrees Cday and 708 degrees Cday, respectively) anticipates the harvest time. Thus, a controlled reduction in the amount of water no negatively impact the growth dynamics, phenology, or cutting time.

AB  - When drought hits water-scarce regions, there are significant repercussions for food and water security, as well as serious issues for the stability of broader social and environmental systems. To mitigate these effects, environmental monitoring and early warning systems aimed at detecting the onset of drought conditions can facilitate timely and effective responses from government and private sector stakeholders. This study uses multistage, participatory research methods across more than 135 interviews, focus groups, and workshops to assess extant climatic, agricultural, hydrological, and drought monitoring systems; key cross-sector drought impacts; and drought monitoring needs in four countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Jordan. This extensive study of user needs for drought monitoring across the MENA region is informing and shaping the ongoing development of drought early warning systems, a composite drought indicator (CDI), and wider drought management systems in each country. Overarching themes of drought monitoring needs include technical definitions of drought for policy purposes; information-sharing regimes and data-sharing platforms; ground-truthing of remotely sensed and modeled data; improved data quality in observation networks; and two-way engagement with farmers, organizations, and end-users of drought monitoring products. This research establishes a basis for informing enhanced drought monitoring and management in the countries, and the broad stakeholder engagement can help foster the emergence of effective environmental monitoring coalitions.

AB  - As a non-contact high-efficiency method, laser triangulation has long been studied by many scholars. Building such a system usually requires calibration where system parameters are found or amended to achieve the targeted precision. Traditional calibration methods require using either precise movement or high precision gauge object that are accompanied with extra manufacturing cost and auxiliary equipment/devices and hence increase the overall cost as well as prevent widespread applications, for instance, due to required environment conditions to be fulfilled. A new static method was, therefore, proposed to calibrate a system without need of a motion or a high precision gauge object to be deployed. The method relies on preparation of the data on a scalar compound target with a geometric estimator as quality indicator. Based on this method, three versions of a low-cost prototype were built, which achieved sub-millimeter precision. Although the precision is sufficient for a measurement often used manufacturing large panels, higher precision is achievable with additional work which is to be undertaken in the future. The proposed method makes tradeoff between precision and cost. This was followed by testing on the measurement of a small panel part as application-case study. The proven feasibility of the method proposed suggested potential of developing low-cost, inline industrial system (large or small) for inspecting sheet parts during manufacturing, especially panel component manufacturing, including that from metal sheets and composite materials.

AB  - School safety is one of the main concerns of administrators and decision-makers both for saving lives and for guaranteeing the continuity of education. This is especially true in natural hazard-prone areas, but it is also true for human-induced hazards. The elaboration and implementation of action plans for reducing the risk level of schools require both assessing all the relevant hazards potentially affecting each school and considering the resources available for the realisation of the required safety upgrading interventions. This paper illustrates the multi-hazard VISUS methodology adopted by UNESCO within the Comprehensive School Safety framework, in line with the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015-2030. VISUS was conceived and developed to provide decision-makers with a quick assessment of safety situations, upgrading needs, and status conditions of a large set of existing learning facilities. The methodology is the result of progressive improvements derived from multiple applications in pilot projects worldwide and in international peer reviews. This paper aims to illustrate the VISUS methodology, framing it within scientific literature. It also presents a selection of outcomes, describing the graphical indicators designed for supporting decision-makers in developing school safety upgrading strategies. Then, an overview of the VISUS applications shows improvements and evolutions of the methodology over the years and recaps its main specificities, highlighting how it can contribute to supporting the implementation of school safety initiatives.

AB  - Many studies have investigated how habitat fragmentation affects the taxonomic and functional diversity of species assemblages. However, the joint effects of habitat fragmentation and environmental conditions on taxonomic and functional diversity, for instance across elevational gradients, have largely been neglected so far. In this study, we compare whether taxonomic and functional indicators show similar or distinct responses to forest fragmentation across an elevational gradient. We based our analysis on a comprehensive data set of species-rich bird assemblages from tropical montane forest in the Southern Andes of Ecuador. We monitored birds over 2years in two habitat types (continuous and fragmented forest) at three elevations (i.e., 1000, 2000, and 3000m a.s.l) and measured nine morphological traits for each bird species on museum specimens. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly higher in fragmented compared to continuous forests and decreased towards high elevations. In contrast, functional diversity was significantly reduced in fragmented compared to continuous forests at low elevations, but fragmentation effects on functional diversity tended to be reversed at high elevations. Our results demonstrate that taxonomic and functional indicators can show decoupled responses to forest fragmentation and that these effects are highly variable across elevations. Our findings reveal that functional homogenization in bird communities in response to fragmentation can be masked by apparent increases in taxonomic diversity, particularly in diverse communities at low elevations.

AB  - The paper presents an evaluation of efficiency and economic potential of the phytoremediation technology, based on the use of energy crops (P. arundinacea L. and B. Napus L.), combined with the fertilization with compost, supported by the addition of nano SiO2. The experiment was conducted in in-situ conditions, using two experimental blocks, divided according to used plant species. Each block included four types of plots with different fertilization treatments (control plots; treatment with nano SiO2; treatment with compost; treatment with mixture of compost and nano SiO2). During the studied period (three vegetation seasons), a cyclic analysis of 16 PAH's content were conducted. Furthermore, a quantitative determination of biomass production was performed as well as assessment of economic potential of different strategies.
   Data collected during research, shows that method based on energy crops use, due to the join effect of the dangerous pollutants removal and the production of removable energy resource, can be considered as sustainable and should be recommended for use during heavy polluted soil remediation. Moreover, it should be also noted, that the best results for both PAH's removal efficiency and biomass production, were acquired on plots with P. arundinacea L. cultivation, fertilized with mix of compost and nano SiO2.

AB  - Many municipalities and public authorities have supported the creation of solar cadastres to map the solar energy-generation potential of existing buildings. Despite advancements in modelling solar potential, most of these tools provide simple evaluations based on benchmarks, neglecting the effect of uncertain environmental conditions and that of the spatial aggregation of multiple buildings. We argue that including such information in the evaluation process can lead to more robust planning decisions and a fairer allocation of public subsidies.
   To this end, this paper presents a novel method to incorporate uncertainty in the evaluation of the solar electricity generation potential of existing buildings using a multi-scale approach. It also presents a technique to visualise the results through their integration in a 3D-mapping environment and the use of false-colour overlays at different scales.
   Using multiple simulation scenarios, the method is able to provide information about confidence intervals of summary statistics of production due to variation in two typical uncertain factors: vegetation and weather. The uncertainty in production introduced by these factors is taken into account through pairwise comparisons of nominal values of indicators, calculating a comprehensive ranking of the energy potential of different spatial locations and a corresponding solar score. The analysis is run at different scales, using space- and time-aggregated results, to provide results relevant to decision-makers.

AB  - Atmospheric environment is a complex system affected by economy, society, population and other factors. Based on DPSIRM framework, scientific relationships among those factors were reflected and inherent mechanism of the complex system was studied. 20 indicators were selected to construct an evaluation index system. Optimizing Projection Pursuit by Simulated Annealing algorithm, the Coupling Simulated Annealing -Projection Pursuit model was established to calculate a comprehensive index, which was used to evaluate the regional Atmospheric Environment Carrying Capacity. The results showed that the Driving force and Pressure subsystems occupied a leading position on the whole system. Economic development, urbanization process, population growth and pollutant emission needed to be concerned to maintain the harmony of the complex system. Influence weights of indicators were quite different from each other. The top 5 indicators were: the amount of industrial smoke and dust emissions, the amount of automobile, the comprehensive energy consumption of 10,000 Yuan industrial output value, the annual average wind speed and the number of days of air quality reached the national standard's second level. By analyzing the evaluation results, Atmospheric Environment Carrying Capacity was on the rise in 2006-2015, which suggested Chengdu's atmospheric environment showed a good condition during these years. However, with the rapid industrialization, urbanization and accompanying pollution, we should boost the corresponding exhaust gas treatment capacity to keep its environmental healthy.

AB  - Palygorskite has been identified as a major constituent of the clay fraction in carbonate soils of arid and semi-arid regions. This fibrous clay has a great significance as a paleoclimatic indicator and is of fundamental importance for a more complete understanding of conditions under which petrocalcic horizons and groundwater carbonates precipitate. The present study was undertaken in order to evaluate the occurrence, the genesis as well as the micromorphological aspects of palygorskite in calcisol and groundwater carbonates. The samples were analyzed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and chemical analysis (XRF). Two modes of genesis for palygorskite were identified: (1) In the petrocalcic horizons, the palygorskite is the dominant clay mineral; palygorskite fibers and fiber bundles extend from euhedral or subhedral calcite crystals showing an authigenic origin of palygorskite. The palygorskite is formed in the vadose environment from infiltrating soil water through the intense evaporation of subsurface water after calcite precipitation. (2) In the groundwater carbonates, smectite flakes appear to terminate palygorskite fibers suggesting formation of palygorskite through the alteration of precursor smectite. The increasing aridity would have caused the intense evaporation conducive to the precipitation of calcite and an increase in pH, which lead to dissolution of smectite and formation of palygorskite.

AB  - Toxicity assessment of water is of great important to the safety of human health and to social security because of more and more toxic compounds that are spilled into the aquatic environment. Therefore, the development of fast and reliable toxicity assessment methods is of great interest and attracts much attention. In this study, by using the electrochemical activity of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells as the toxicity indicator, 3,5-dichlorophenol (DCP) as the model toxic compound, a new biosensor for water toxicity assessment was developed. Strikingly, the presence of DCP in the water significantly inhibited the maximum current output of the S. oneidensis MR-1 in a three-electrode system and also retarded the current evolution by the cells. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum current output of the biosensor was proportional to the concentration of DCP up to 30 mg/L. The half maximal inhibitory concentration of DCP determined by this biosensor is about 14.5 mg/L. Furthermore, simultaneous monitoring of the retarded time (Delta t) for current generation allowed the identification of another biosensor signal in response to DCP which could be employed to verify the electrochemical result by dual confirmation. Thus, the present study has provided a reliable and promising approach for water quality assessment and risk warning of water toxicity.

AB  - During the last decade, it has been uncovered that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, are related to many diseases including cancers. With an increase in reports describing the dysregulation of miRNAs in various tumor types, it has become abundantly clear that miRNAs play significant roles in the formation and progression of cancers. Intriguingly, miRNAs are present in body fluids because they are packed in exosomes/extracellular vesicles and released from all types of cells. The miRNAs in the fluids are measured in a relatively simple way and the profile of miRNAs is likely to be an indicator of health condition. In recent years, various studies have demonstrated that some naturally occurring compounds can control tumor-suppressive and oncogenic miRNAs in a positive manner, suggesting that food-derived compounds could maintain the expression levels of miRNAs and help maintain good health. Therefore, our daily food and compounds in food are of great interest. In addition, exogenous diet-derived miRNAs have been indicated to function in the regulation of target mammalian transcripts in the body. These findings highlight the possibility of diet for good health through the regulation of miRNAs, and we also discuss the perspective of food application and health promotion.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the behavioral and physiological changes of heat stressed Corriedale ewes exposed to water deprivation. Nine Corriedale ewes (average BW = 45 +/- 3.7 kg) were individually fed diets based on maintenance requirements in metabolic crates. Ewes were assigned into three groups (9 sheep per treatment) according to a 3 x 3 Latin square design for 3 periods with 21-d duration for each period. The control (CON) group was given free access to water, 2 h water deprivation (2hWD), and 3 h water deprivation (3hWD) following feeding. No differences were found in fecal excretion frequency, standing frequency (number/d), and sitting frequency among the groups (p > 0.05). Measurements of standing duration (min/d) and urine excretion frequency (number/d) showed a significant decrease whereas sitting duration (min/d) showed a significant increase in the 2hWD and 3hWD groups when compared with the CON group (p < 0.05). Fecal score and heart rate (number/min) were not different among the groups (p > 0.05). However, respiratory rate (number/min) and panting score were found to be significantly higher in the 2hWD and 3hWD groups than in the CON group (p < 0.05). It is concluded that water deprivation following feeding intensifies physiological heat stress related indicators such as respiratory rate and panting score and changes behavioral parameters such as water intake and urine excretion frequency in heat stressed ewes. Daily adaptation to the extreme environmental conditions may occur actively in ewes.

AB  - A kinetic determination of V(V) as a catalyst was spectrophotometrically performed by using the indicator reaction of Gallamine blue (GB(+)) and bromate at pH 2.0. The reaction was followed by measuring absorbance change for a fixed-time of 3 min at 537 nm. The variables such as reagent concentration, pH, buffer concentration, ionic strength and temperature were optimized to improve the selectivity and sensitivity. Under the optimized conditions, the determination of V(V) was performed in the range 1-100 mu g L-1 with limits of detection and quantification of 0.31 and 0.94 mu g L-1. The developed kinetic method is sufficiently sensitive, selective and simple. It was successfully applied to the speciative determination of total V and inorganic dissolved vanadium species, V(V) and V(IV) in environmental water samples. The oxidizing property of permanganate is used to differentiate between V(IV) and V(V) species. The V(IV) content was found by subtracting the V(V) content from those of total V. The recovery is above 95% for V(V) spiked samples. Additionally, the accuracy was validated by analysis of a certified water sample, CRM TMDA-53.3, and the results were in good agreement with the certified value.

AB  - The degradation of veterinary drugs approved for use in aquaculture is very important in the evaluation of the impact of these drugs on the environment and to ensure safe food production. The purpose of this study is to provide guidance on how the interpretation of environmental fate data can be used by applicants to aid in protecting the environment and for the basis for food production, by suggesting the correct interpretation of data as part of an effective registration process. Tests were performed using a modification of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 308 guideline using erythromycin and oxolinic acid under combinations of aerobic and anaerobic conditions, with and without sediment, in sea water and fresh water. Estimated DT(50)s of erythromycin in fresh and sea water ranged from 6.8 to 37.9 days and estimated DT(90)s were from 22.6 to 125.9 days. Degradation was more rapid in fresh water than in sea water with the formation of three degradation products: anhydroerythomycin A, erythromycin A enol ether, and pseudoerythomycin A enol ether. Estimated DT(50)s of oxolinic acidinfresh and sea water were from 10.3 to 63.0 days and estimated DT90s were from 34.3 to 209.4 days which suggests that oxolinic acid is more persistent in the environment than erythromycin.

AB  - How much are Chinese people and various citizen groups concerned about the environment relative to other major public problems? What are the key factors and to what extent do these factors shape individual Chinese environmental concern? Based on a micro-macro model and a county fixed model proposed in this study, we employ nationwide representative public opinion survey data and provincial statistics to examine the determinants and variations of public environmental concern in China. The data shows that environmental concern is not among the top-ranked issue concerns in China overall, but in the urban areas and in the east-coastal region environmental protection features as a rather important issue. Our regression analyses further demonstrate that the Chinese environmental concern is significantly affected by both micro-level socio-demographic variables and macro-level regional economic conditions and environmental risks. In the east-coastal region, such individuals as urbanites with high income are most environmentally concerned. There is a lack of concern over environmental issues among the public in the west region, where little association between individual sociodemographics and their environmental concern is detected. In the central-northeast region, education effect is evident in the rural area. Location contextual factors such as economic development and environmental risk account for most of the observed variations in public environment concern. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The soil erodibility factor of RUSLE is one of the important indicators of land degradation. It can be measured either directly under natural or simulated rainfall condition or indirectly estimated by empirical models. A geospatial variation of this factor is essential for prioritization of reclamation measures. However, geospatial upscaling of soil erodibility factor is very uncertain because of its dynamic nature and dependent on the parameters used in the model. This paper studies the geospatial comparison of the effectiveness of four different models to predict the soil erodibility factor by means of the independent role of each model parameter. 669 soil samples were collected from different land uses of Central India on grid basis and analyzed for physicochemical properties. The soil erodibility factor was estimated using four different models. Geostatistical analysis was performed on the point erodibility data of each model to obtain the spatial pattern. Analysis of variance showed that soil properties and erodibility factor varied significantly with various land uses. Croplands showed higher susceptibility to erosion than woodlands and grasslands. The erodibility equation that used particle size with soil organic matter showed better agreement with the variation of land use than the equation used only particle size. Therefore, the models that dynamically integrate soil intrinsic properties with land use can successfully be used for geospatial upscaling of soil erodibility factor.

AB  - The quality of soils found in mines is low if they do not receive any reclamation treatment; yet, to the authors' knowledge, there are still no equations to evaluate the quality of metal-contaminated mine soils after the application of the most widely used reclamation treatments (planting vegetation and amending with wastes). Therefore, the purposes of the present study were 1) to propose a method for developing soil quality indexes (SQIs); 2) to develop the SQIs for 2 types of mine soils (settling pond and mine tailing) reclaimed by planting trees, amending with wastes, or both; and 3) to assess the quality of these soils under field conditions. The results obtained after the use of an SQI developed for reclaimed mine soils through the selection of an SQI with a factor analysis and the totaling of the scores of the selected variables revealed that this method is a valid tool for developing SQIs. Applying this index with reclaimed mine soils showed that the untreated sites had a very low quality and that the treatment that most improved the soils was amending with wastes (sewage sludges and paper mill residues). The authors recommend the periodic addition of sewage sludges and paper mill residues to degraded sites as they increase the quality of soils, but the effects decrease over time.

AB  - The slope instability is connected to a large diversity of causative and triggering factors, ranging from inherent geological structure to the environmental conditions. Thus, assessment and prediction of slope failure hazard is a difficult and complex multi-parametric problem. In contrast to the analytic approaches, the systems approaches are able to consider infinite number of affecting parameters and assess the interactions of each couple of the parameters in the system. This paper presents a complete application of the rock engineering systems approach in prediction of the instability potential of rock slopes in 15 stations along a 20 km section of the Khosh-Yeylagh Main Road, Iran as the case study of the research. In this research, the main objective has been defining the principal causative and triggering factors responsible for the manifestation of slope instability phenomena, quantify their interactions, obtain their weighted coefficients, and calculate the slope instability index, which refers to the inherent potential instability of each slope of the examined region. The final results have been mapped to highlight the rock slopes susceptible to instability. Finally, as a preliminary validation on the utilization of systems approach in the study region, the stability of investigated rock slopes were analyzed using an empirical method and the results were compared. The comparisons showed a rather good coincidence between the given classes of two methods.

AB  - In the global warming context, we compared the thermal tolerance of several populations of the crustacean Gammarus pulex (Amphipoda: Gammaridae) along a latitudinal thermal gradient in the Rhne Valley. To disentangle the effect of regional (North vs. South) and local (site-specific) factors, the ecophysiological responses of populations were investigated at two levels of biological organisation: whole organism level considering body size [critical thermal maximum (CTmax), mean speed of locomotion (MS), time mobile (TM)] and organelle function level [mitochondrial respiratory control ratios (RCRs)]. CTmax and RCRs, but not MS and TM, revealed a significantly higher thermal tolerance in southern populations compared to northern ones. Nevertheless, temperatures a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 30A degrees C were deleterious for all populations, suggesting that populations located in the warmer limit of the species distribution will be more threatened by climate change as they live closer to their upper thermal limits. The strong differences observed between populations indicate that the species-level thermal tolerance used in predictive models may not be informative enough to study the impact of global warming on species distributions. This work also reveals that an appropriate choice of indicators is essential to study the consequences of global warming since the response of organisms at the whole body level can be influenced by local conditions.

AB  - Foraminiferal assemblages from three locations of the Moravian part of the Carpathian Foredeep (Kralice, Premyslovice, Zidlochovice) have been studied in order to determine the paleoenvironmental conditions during the Early Badenian (Middle Miocene). Paleobiological characteristics (plankton/benthos-ratio, relative abundances of warm-water plankton species, five-chambered Globoturborotalita spp., Coccolithus pelagicus and high nutrient markers [benthos], test sizes and ranges of Globigerina sp. and cibicidoids, Benthic Foraminiferal Oxygen Index) were determined along with stable C and 0 isotope compositions. The stable isotope compositions show large variabilities indicating sample inhomogeneity in well preserved foraminiferal samples, interpreted as a sign of primary environmental variation and postmortem mixing of tests of different populations and sources. Based on the combined interpretation of paleobiological indicators and isotopic compositions, two theoretical models were established to describe the observed paleobiological and stable isotope data, that were used to categorize the locations studied. Several types of near-shore paleoenvironment were distinguished using the theoretical models: (i) bay influenced by seasonal phytodetritus supply from the continent (Kralice); (ii) dynamic shore characterized by variable isotopic compositions probably due to mixing of indigenous, transported and reworked tests (Premyslovice); (iii) shore of alternating normal marine and continentally influenced environments (Zidlochovice).

AB  - This study aimed to determine which attributes of a Cerrado Oxisol under organic production are more impacted by cropping systems consisted of combinations of common bean and corn crops, no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems, and cover crops. Multivariate analysis techniques were applied on data of four experiments, two of them under NT and the other two in CT, one carried out with common bean crop and another with corn. The experiments were installed annually since November 2003 in Santo Antonio de Goias, GO, in randomized block design, with four replications. Samples were taken from soil layer of 0-0.10 m in September 2003 for the initial chemical analysis (chemical reference). In November 2007 a new sampling of the plots and of a forest (physical and biological reference) was performed for determination of soil physical (PA), chemical (CA) and biological (BA) attributes. The cropping systems caused changes in PA and BA, as compared to the forest, and in CA, as compared to the initial chemical condition of soil. PA were more sensitive to detect changes in the quality of the soil under cultivation. The metabolic and microbial quotients were the most negatively affected by CT as compared to NT. CA were more sensitive in discriminating common bean crop from corn crop.

AB  - The collaborative design process supports the development of successful systems and products with a many participating engineers from a variety of disciplines. This kind of working environment lays stress on obtaining such multidisciplinary knowledge. Such efforts became an important element of capstone projects for students from different departments. This paper describes research related to the use of didactic sets in a problem based classroom setting. These sets are designed and implemented by teams comprising students from the Mechatronics and Industrial Engineering departments. They are installed in the mechatronics lab at the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad, Serbia. The sets are used by students who are enrolled on a number of courses as part of their lab practice in the Mechatronics and Industrial Engineering departments. These didactic sets enable the integration of knowledge gained from various courses. They help the students to understand the connections between different engineering fields. Some of the lab topics that can be delivered with this kind of equipment are: electric motors, frequency controllers, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), fieldbus systems, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The students are involved in problem-based learning during hands-on activities such as making mechanical connections or wiring. Each didactic set consists of: an asynchronous three-phase electric motor, a frequency controller, a PLC, different relays, pushbuttons, indicators, and wiring. Some of the most important learning benefits are obtained through scenarios that simulate real industrial tasks and conditions.

AB  - Target-oriented evaluations have provided important information by indicating the small progress which was achieved in the implementation of many cross-sectorality concepts. However causative evaluation can only show where the obstacles for success are and by which means cross-sectorality can be improved. The model for causative evaluation discussed is based on the analysis of network bridging sectors. Despite the strong interest in autonomy of the sectors, specific bridges between specific stakeholders can be built and thus support intersectorality. The bridging mechanisms are theoretically based on new institutionalism theory and empirically tested in 12 forest environment policy networks in eight European countries. Important means for fostering cross-sectorality are financial incentives and institutional pressure whereas, scientific expertise or trust are not strong enough to break through the borders of sectors. The influence of state agencies hinders cross-sectorality. Low formalized programmes give freedom for intersectoral cooperation. The individual factors can be comprised into different strategies for intersectoral networking. These strategies are designed on the theoretical basis of networks of macrocorporatism, societal corporatism and open issue network. The models for cross-sectoral networks are theoretically based, focused on factors which are changeable and use indicators which are empirically checked in an easy way. Therefore, the network models are well suited to serve as models for causative evaluation which informs about the means and conditions such as affect cross-sectorality in a given case.

AB  - Although several studies have suggested that behavioural measures may be more comprehensive than other biomarkers for indicating an organism's health or welfare, this has rarely been investigated in free-living terrestrial vertebrates. Here we examine the expression of dawn singing behaviour in a free-living small songbird in relation to environmental pollution. We compared the singing behaviour of male great tits Parus major inhabiting an area extremely polluted with heavy metals with that of males inhabiting areas of low(er) pollution (at 4 and 20 km distance from the pollution source). Males at the most polluted site had a significantly smaller repertoire size than males at the two other sites. They also produced a significantly lower total amount of song during the dawn chorus than the males at a distance of 4 km from the pollution source. Our results, although non-experimental and obtained in field conditions, strongly suggest that heavy metal pollution might affect the expression of singing behaviour. Taking into account that previous studies were not able to detect clear, straightforward differences between the health of great tits at the most polluted site and at 4 km distance from the pollution source, our results suggest that the singing behaviour of great tits may be a useful indicator of environmental stress at the population level.

AB  - In China, the allelopathy research has been done oil various aspects viz., crop-crop interactions, weed-crop interactions, weed management, agroforestry, pastures and grasslands and agroecosystems. The allelopathic effects of crops (wheat, Triticum aestivum L., soybean, Glycine max Merril), weeds (rice and Echinochloa crus-galli; wheat and Digitaria ciliaris (Retz.) Koel), trees, and miscellaneous spp. have been studied in laboratory bioassays, pot cultures and field studies.
   Wheat allelopathy research were conducted both in laboratory and field condition since wheat-maize rotation system is very common in North China. Wheat straw mulching Oil coming maize field was recommended by governmental behavior. Several research groups have conducted research on soybean allelopathy because continuous cropping in Northeast of China and some of the allelochemicals were identified. In weed-crop interactions allelopathic effect of Bidens pilosa, Ambrosia trifida, Pedicularis longiflora, Ageratum conyzoides, Eupatorium adenophorum and Miscellaneous weed species were reported. In agro-forestry systems allelopathic effect of some Poplar and Eucalypus species were listed. Autotoxicity of Chinese-fir and Pinus massoniana, Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. and Casuarnia equisetifolia was studied by some of the Chinese allelopathy researchers. In the natural communities allelopathic effect of Dicranopteris dichotoma (Thumb.) Bernh, Woodwordia japonica (L.f.) Sm. and Hicriopteris glauca (Thumb.) Ching., Chinese wedelia (Wedelia chinensis (Osbeck) Merr.), Dicranopteris pedata (Houtt.) Nakaike, Stellera chamaejasme L., Artemisia ordosica were conducted. Stellera chamaejasme is a natural grassland degradation indicator weed in North of China. Research achievements and further research requirements for China are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Some 2600 bog oaks have been dated from German, Dutch and Irish bogs covering the period 6000 BC to AD 1000. The ring patterns of these 'bog oaks' are characterized by recurrent, long-term growth depressions. In addition, obvious changes in the temporal distribution of the bog-oak trunks throughout the Holocene are found. Both features were probably caused by unfavourable growth conditions, which are most likely linked to changes in site hydrology. We use a new variable, annual mean age', as a tool to analyse the population dynamics of bog oaks in more detail, enabling the detection of synchronous intersite and interregional changes. It is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the age of all trees in each calendar year. We performed the calculation on regional (Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland) subsets of the bog-oak series. Abrupt changes in annual mean age are taken to indicate periods of generation change. We find good agreement for the interval from 5000 BC to 2000 BC between the continental (combined German and Dutch) and the Irish mean-age chronologies. Most changes in population dynamics correspond with contemporary changes in the associated regional tree-ring chronologies. It is concluded that the observed changes in population dynamics and growth activity are responses to common environmental forcing, most likely related to climate.

AB  - The caprellid (Crustacea: Amphipoda) community associated with the alga Cystoseira usneoides (L.) Roberts 1967 was studied on a spatial scale in relation to the influence of environmental factors on the coast of Ceuta (North Africa) using multivariate analyses. Twenty-two stations were sampled and five environmental factors were tested (hydrodynamics, silting, suspended organic matter, organic matter in silt and suspended solids). The spatial distribution of the caprellid community reflected the physico-chemical conditions of the coast. Phtisica marina Slabber 1769 was the only species present at the stations of the harbour of Ceuta, characterised by the lowest values of hydrodynamics and the highest values of silting, suspended organic matter and suspended solids. The most exposed stations (high hydrodynamics and low values of silting, dissolved organic matter and suspension solids) were mainly dominated by Caprella danilevskii Czerniavskii 1868 and C. penantis Leach 1814. These,two species have developed a "parallel" posture that enables them to attach strongly to the substratum and thus inhabit areas subjected to heavy exposure or strong currents. Caprella acanthifera Leach 1814 and Pseudoprotella phasma (Montagu 1804) preferred stations characterised by moderate values of silting and suspended solids, such as those located in the coastal areas in front of the city of Ceuta, but these species were not found at the most stressed harbour stations.

AB  - Solutions to past environmental problems affect the landscape. Their evaluation is often limited by a lack of scientific data. Yet valid scientific questions remain for which alternative research methods must be found. Soil erosion and the effects of conservation methods in the Kingdom of Lesotho, southern Africa, posed such problems.
   Three separate but complementary studies used field observations, archival research, and interviews with rural people to obtain information about past conditions of the landscape and the effects of soil conservation programs. At the time of the first conservation program in the 1930s, soil erosion was not widespread. The primary cause of gully erosion was roads and paths. A structure-based conservation program to protect the landscape actually caused gully initiation in some fields. While official documents provided general descriptions, older people gave detailed descriptions of erosion processes. They also described their own monitoring of the structures and efforts to mitigate their ill effects. The removal or modification of structures was an act of conservation, not of destruction.
   These studies led to the formulation of an historical environmental impact assessment (HEIA) to reconstruct the effects of past interventions in landscapes. The steps of conventional environmental impact assessments were modified for work in the past. HEIAs could provide information about undocumented environments, extend baselines of modern EIAs, and identify past failures and successes to guide modern programs.

AB  - Marina and charter industry represent the two basic segments of nautical tourism sector, one of the key elements of tourism development in the countries of the Mediterranean circle. With the advent of ever more ambiguous business environment driven by global health hazards, the emergence of next technological revolution and global competition, insight into the antecedents of competitiveness of companies in the nautical tourism sector in an important topic for organizations who want to survive and grow. The goal of this paper is comparison of the fundamental features of these two interconnected industries. The marina industry, observed through the financial indicators, shows attractiveness and stability. Regardless of the marina category, the success of its operations proved to be stable even in crisis market conditions. On the other hand, the charter industry, that complements the value proposition of the marina industry, shows lower level of robustness in times of crisis. The contribution of the paper is twofold. Firstly, for the purpose of the comparison of these two industries we present their basic indicators, and argue that the dynamic connection of the charter and marina industries opens possibilities to achieve higher level of competitiveness in both businesses. Also, since the available data on both industries is scarce, the paper introduces a system of data estimates, as well as system of experiential forecasting which can be used in different markets where similar limitations can be observed.

AB  - The ecological and economic problems associated with conventional cutting fluids can be resolved by identifying a sustainable and improved cooling/lubrication approach. The vegetable oil-based minimum quantity lubrication has a good amount of acceptability toward achieving sustainable and eco-friendly machining. This work investigates the efficacy of vegetable oil-based MQL (VMQL) and minimum quantity solid lubricant (MQSL) during turning AISI 4140 steel with coated carbide tools compared to dry and wet machining. Various sustainable aspects such as machining efficiency, total energy consumption, carbon emission, and various performance indicators such as surface roughness, chip-tool interface temperature, and tool life are evaluated under selected cooling/lubricating conditions. The experimental findings showcased the superiority of VMQL and MQSL in the form of improved machining performance compared to dry and wet machining. Noticeable reduction in surface roughness up to 27% and 20% at cutting speed 100 m/min and 45% and 41% at cutting speed 170 m/min is achieved with VMQL and MQSL, respectively. Furthermore, VMQL and MQSL reduced energy consumption by 33% and 28% at lower MRR and 26% and 22% at higher MRR, respectively, compared to dry machining. The results showcased the ability of VMQL in machining to achieve sustainability and energy-saving with improved product quality.

AB  - Proactive aggression (PA) is a planned and unprovoked form of aggression that is most often enacted for personal gain or in anticipation of a reward. Frequently described as "cold-blooded " or goal oriented, PA is thought to be associated with low autonomic arousal. With this view in mind, we performed a scoping review of the biological correlates of PA and identified 74 relevant articles. Physiological findings indicated a robust association between PA and reduced resting heart rate, and to a lesser extent a relationship between PA and decreased heart rate and skin conductance reactivity, perhaps indicating dampened sympathetic function. The twin literature identified PA as a heritable trait, but little evidence implicates specific genes in the pathogenesis of PA. Neuroimaging studies of PA pinpoint impaired amygdala function in the assessment and conditioning of aversive stimuli, which may influence the establishment of behavioral patterns. Nodes of the default mode network were identified as possible neural correlates of PA, suggesting that altered function of this network may be involved in the genesis of PA. Given the overlap of PA with reactive aggression and the overall behavioral complexity of PA, it is clear that multiple endophenotypes of PA exist. This comprehensive review surveys the most salient neurobiologically informed research on PA.

AB  - Detecting the presence of persons and estimating their quantity in an indoor environment has grown in importance recently. For example, the information if a room is unoccupied can be used for automatically switching off the light, air conditioning, and ventilation, thereby saving significant amounts of energy in public buildings. Most existing solutions rely on dedicated hardware installations, which involve presence sensors, video cameras, and carbon dioxide sensors. Unfortunately, such approaches are costly, subject to privacy concerns, have high computational requirements, and lack ubiquitousness. The work presented in this article addresses these limitations by proposing a low-cost occupancy detection system. Our approach builds upon detecting variations in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals related to the presence of humans. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by performing comprehensive tests on five different datasets. We apply several pattern recognition models and compare our methodology with systems building upon IEEE 802.11 (WiFi). On average, in multifarious environments, we can correctly classify the occupancy with an accuracy of 97.97%. When estimating the number of people in a room, on average, the estimated number of subjects differs from the actual one by 0.32 persons. We conclude that our system's performance is comparable to that of existing ones based on WiFi, while significantly reducing cost and installation effort. Hence, our approach makes occupancy detection practical for real-world deployments.

AB  - Straw is the main resource of fuel for biomass power generation plants in China's agricultural areas. Field survey and emergy analysis were employed to investigate the operation situation of the straw collection, transportation and storage system based on the case of Laifa Straw Recycling Company. In the condition of collecting 2 x 10(8) kg of straw production, the emergy input of the artificial model of the company was 173.02 x 10(18) sej, which was higher than the emergy input of the mechanical model, 148.11 x 10(18) sej. According to the emergy indicator system, the mechanical model had a high development degree of internal resources and environment, high productivity, high sustainable development ability, but a lower proportion of renewable resource emergy input than the artificial model. The emergy value of 1 kg commercial straw calculated from the commercial price was 0.25 x 10(12) sej, which was only one third of the average input of the company to produce 1 kg commercial straw (0.74 x 10(12)-0.87 x 10(12) sej). It was difficult for straw recycling company to survive in the market due to the low price of the commercial straw. Therefore, the government was suggested to take effective economic policies to support local straw recycling enterprises. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the field of structural-health monitoring, vibration-based structural damage detection techniques have been practically implemented in recent decades for structural condition assessment. With the development of deep-learning networks that make automatic feature extraction and high classification accuracy possible, deep-learning-based structural damage detection has been gaining significant attention. The deep-learning neural networks come with fixed input and output size, and input data must be downsampled or cropped to the predetermined input size of the networks to obtain desired output of the network. However, the length of input data (i.e., sensing data) is associated with the excitation quality of a structure, adjusting the size of the input data while maintaining the excitation quality is critical to ensure high accuracy of the deep-learning-based structural damage detection. To address this issue, natural-excitation-technique-based data normalization and the use of 1-D convolutional neural networks for automated structural damage detection are presented. The presented approach converts input data to predetermined size using cross-correlation and uses convolutional network to extract damage-sensitive feature for automated structural damage identification. Numerical simulations were conducted on a simply supported beam model excited by random and traffic loadings, and the performance was validated under various scenarios. The proposed method successfully detected the location of damage on a beam under random and traffic loadings with accuracies of 99.90% and 99.20%, respectively.

AB  - In the context of global warming and environmental deterioration, the environment impact assessment is a crucial institutional guaranty to assure less or no pollution during the process of the economic growth and rapid social development. This paper selected the environmental regulation system in China as a research target and assesses the effectiveness of green tax on the environment through an empirical analysis. The panel data from 2005 to 2015 in different cities in China are employed to analyze with a two-way fixed regression model; it analyzes the impact of environmental instruments like resource tax, excise tax, vehicle purchase tax, and pollutant discharge fees on environmental pollution and finds that the modeling conditions with green tax reform can lead to higher effect on environmental pollutant constrain but is distributed differently among east, central, and west based on the empirical analysis in China. Moreover, resource tax has a significant effect in the east and midwest of China. The effectiveness of excise tax on integrated pollution is not statistically significant. Compared with the midwest, eastern China's green tax had a much better performance on reducing environmental pollution. Pollutant discharge fees indicates a significant negative correlation to integrated pollution. The consumption of the other goods (like meat consumption) plays a mediating effect between vehicle purchase tax and integrated environmental pollution. In addition, the relevant policy recommendations are proposed against different tax types.

AB  - The analysis of energy configuration in the planning of data-center-park-integrated energy systems (DCP-IESs) has become an enormous challenge, owing to multi-energy complementarity, energy cascade use, and energy security. In this study, a configuration model of DCP-IESs was established to obtain the economic and low-carbon energy uses of the data centers, based on mixed integer linear programming. In the model, carbon emissions were converted to economic indicators through carbon pricing. Then, the configuration model was modified according to the security of the proposed device switching logic, and the Markov-based reliability estimation method was used to ensure the redundant design of the configuration. Using the new energy configuration method, the DCP-IES configuration scheme could be obtained under economical, low-carbon, and high reliability conditions. A data center park in Shanghai was selected as a case study, and the results are as follows: it will only take 2.88 years for the economics of DCP-IES to reach those of traditional data center energy systems. Additionally, the use of configuration model in DCP-IES would result in a reduction in annual carbon emissions of 39,323 tons, with a power usage effectiveness of 1.388, whereas an increase in reliability results in an increasingly faster increase in the initial investment cost.

AB  - Food-borne pathogens are one of the leading causes of illness and death particularly in developing countries. This study was aimed at analyzing the hygiene indicator microorganisms and pathogens of minced meat and contact surface materials in butcher shops in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Additionally, a checklist was applied to evaluate the hygiene condition of the establishments, and a questionnaire/checklist was used to assess food safety knowledge of the food handlers. This study has indicated that the mean microbial counts (total aerobic mesophilic, staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, aerobic spores and yeasts/molds) of the minced meat and contact surface materials in butcher shops ranged between 2.35 and 6.50 log.cfu/g and between 1.80 and 6.30 log.cfu/cm(2), respectively. The mean microbial counts of minced meat samples taken in the morning and afternoon showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). The prevalence of E. coli, Salmonella, and S. aureus in minced meat and contact surface samples was exhibited as 43.75 and 29.17%, 6.25 and 4.17%, and 37.50 and 37.50% in that order. The study has indicated that minced meat samples and contact surface materials had higher microbial load with poor personal and work area sanitation. Low knowledge of food handlers in the butcher shops and broken cold chain have also been found as major contributing factors for the contamination of beef.

AB  - Using renewable energy to power seawater desalination technologies can reduce the environmental impacts of a process which is essential for global water security. However, the uneven geospatial distribution of renewable energy resources and regions of water scarcity results in unequal environmental benefits which creates uncertainty for global policy making. Hence, this study explores the relation between renewable energy resources, freshwater demand, and associated environmental impacts of desalination plants driven by renewable energy at a global scale using a comparative life-cycle assessment approach. We focus on an optimized solar-driven thermal desalination plant that we developed which can be used in seawater and brackish water treatment. By examining the life-cycle impact of the proposed plant in seven water-stressed cities, we found that the mean value for CO2 emissions is 4.32 kg CO2 eq./m(3) of desalted water which is 47% lower than conventional thermal desalination. There is a variation by as much as 80% and 95% in the climate change and water depletion, categories respectively across the selected cities. The multi-city analysis provides energy and water utilities, CSP project developers, and environmental authorities a global assessment of the environmental impact of solar desalination and sheds light on the correlation between solar intensity and seawater conditions on the overall environmental impact of this technology.

AB  - Specific industrial point sources of PM10 were identified by combining real-time meteorological observations and mineralogical examination (XRD, SEM-EDS, TEM-EDS) of individual particles collected during five individual week-long sampling campaigns in 2011 in the most industrialized region of Poland. Major (> 20 vol%) and subordinate components of PM10 (soot, quartz, gypsum, aluminosilicates, Fe-oxides, dolomite, and Pb-chloride) occur in different proportions season-depending and are of limited use in the identification of the emission point sources. Some minor components (particles of Cd- and Tl-bearing ZnS, and of iron and Cr-steel) related to meteorological conditions enabled identification of a large zinc refinery (35 km NW of the sampling site) and integrated iron and steelmaking plant located close to (10 km NE) the sampling site as the most probable emission point sources. Three other large steel plants located in the SW wind rose sector at a distance of 28, 75, and 80 km of the sampling site were typified as potential point sources based on submicron metal particles (Mn-alloyed steel, brass, hematite, magnetite, Fe-spinels). Combination of meteorological data and mineralogical investigation of airborne individual particles enabled distinguishing between sources of similar mineral tracers located in different sectors of wind rose and provided direct evidence for Zn and Cl speciation.

AB  - A treatment chain including nanofiltration, crystallization and multi-effect distillation (MED) is for the first time proposed for the treatment of an effluent produced during the regeneration of Ion Exchange resins employed for water softening. The goal is to recover the minerals and to restore the regenerant solution to be reused in the next regeneration cycle. MED is the most crucial unit of the treatment chain from an economic point of view. A techno-economic analysis on the MED unit was performed and a novel performance indicator, named Levelized Brine Cost, was introduced as a measure of the economic feasibility of the process. Different scenarios were analysed, assuming different thermal energy sources and configurations (plane-MED or MED-TVC). It was found that the plane-MED fed by waste-heat at 1 bar is very competitive, leading to a reduction of 50% of the fresh regenerant current cost. Moreover, the thermal energy cost of 20USS/MWhth was identified as the threshold value below which producing regenerant solution in the MED is economically more advantageous than buying a fresh one. Overall, MED allows reducing the environmental impact of the industrial process and it results competitive with the state of the art for a wide range of operating conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Norovirus (NoV) is a contagious virus causing acute gastroenteritis and is mainly responsible for diarrheal outbreak in closed settings. The aims of this study were to describe the epidemiological characteristic of an outbreak in a boarding school, to assess the extent of the outbreak and to implement appropriate control measures.
   Methodology: A descriptive study was conducted to describe the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak. Data on demographic details, onset of abdominal symptoms, food intake history and contact with ill person three days prior to illness were obtained.
   Results: Twelve fresh stool and 14 food samples were tested for NoV and enteric pathogens, respectively. Out of 745 students, 42 (5.6%) were infected during this outbreak. Predominant clinical features were diarrhea (76.1%), vomiting (71.4%) and abdominal pain (67%). Eight (67%) stool samples and six (43.9%)food samples were positive for NoV and total conforms, respectively. The dissemination of the disease was due to poor hygiene practices among students. Quarantine was imposed until the last case on September 28, 2016. The outbreak was declared over on September 30, 2016.
   Conclusions: A NoV outbreak was determined first time in Malaysia. Environmental assessment showed poor hygienic conditions in the school's kitchen. The number of infected students increased considerably despite the implementation of preventive and control measures. Quarantine was effective to stop the outbreak which is characteristics of NoV outbreak.

AB  - Amid the growing population, climate change and decreasing water availability, water resources planning faces the challenge of achieving efficient and equitable water use, mainly in food production, its greatest consumer. The sustainability of agricultural water consumption in the Cachapoal River basin (34 degrees S 71 degrees O) is assessed using the blue (WFSblue) and gray water footprint sustainability (WFSgray) indicators under conditions of climate variability. The WFSblue indicator of agricultural water consumption showed unsustainability in the upper basin in the dry year (2007), indicating severe water scarcity in autumn and low scarcity in spring, and in the wet year (2005), in which moderate water scarcity was observed only in spring, as a result of the decrease in blue water availability (WA(blue)) and the increase in the blue water footprint (WFblue), exceeding environmental flow requirements and the environmental carrying capacity. An opposite situation was found in the lower basin, where no water scarcity was observed in the analyzed years. Surface water quality, based on the concentration of fertilizers applied to crops, was observed to be more affected and unsustainable (WFSgray) in the upper basin in the autumn and winter period of the dry year (2007). Currently, the indicators can be applied to provide useful information on the sustainability of water use in basins in order to establish and meet water resources protection objectives.

AB  - Indicated pressure diagrams were measured during experimental campaigns on the control of fuel injection, turbocharging and hybrid exhaust gas recirculation systems in an automotive downsized diesel engine. Three-part load operating conditions were selected for four test sets, where strategies aimed at the reduction of NOx emissions and fuel consumption, limiting penalties in soot emissions and combustion noise were applied to the selected systems. Processing of in-cylinder pressure signal, its first derivative and curves of the rate of heat release allowed us to evaluate seven parameters related to the combustion centre and duration, maximum values of pressure, heat release and its first derivative, heat released in the premixed phase and a combustion noise indicator. Relationships between these quantities and engine operating, energy and environmental parameters were then obtained by referring to the four test sets. In the paper, the most significant links are presented and discussed, aiming at a better understanding of the influence of control variables on the combustion process and the effects on engine behaviour. The proposed methodology proved to be a consistent tool for this analysis, useful for supporting the application of alternative fuels or advanced combustion modes.

AB  - In deep metal mines, seismic hazards (for example, rock bursts and roof collapses) occur easily due to the influence of complicated geological conditions, high-stress environments and strong blast disturbances. A microseismic (MS) monitoring technique was used to evaluate rock mass stability in the Hongtoushan copper mine in China. The changes in the multiple MS parameters, including the apparent volume, energy index, spatial correlation length, fractal dimension and b value, during the mining process were presented. The results showed that the MS sequences decayed following Omori's power-law and that the rock mass returned to a relatively stable state after approximately 20days of blasting. After each stoping, the proportion of large-scale fractures increased, the MS events become more concentrated, and the long-range correlations of the rock mass weakened. These changes caused b value, fractal characteristics and spatial correlation length to decrease significantly. Although the risk of a large-scale rock mass failure was reduced, the risk of a local failure increased. As the mining process continued, stress and deformation gradually increased, and the areas with concentrated stress and large deformation were not consistent. Control measures for hazards should be implemented according to the corresponding occurrence mechanisms as determined from the differences in the rock mass physics mechanics.

AB  - Internal concentrations link external exposure to the potential effect, as they reflect what the organisms actually take up and experience physiologically. In this study, we investigated whether frequently detected risk-driving substances in water were found in the exposed organisms and if they are classified the same based on the whole body internal concentrations. Field gammarids were collected upstream and downstream of ten wastewater treatment plants in mixed land use catchments. The sampling was conducted in autumn and winter, during low flow conditions when diffuse agricultural input was reduced. The field study was complemented with laboratory and flume experiments to determine the bioaccumulation potentials of selected substances. For 32 substances, apparent bioaccumulation factors in gammarids were determined for the first time. With a sensitive multiresidue method based on online-solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, we detected 63 (semi-) polar organic substances in the field gammarids, showing higher concentrations downstream than upstream. Interestingly, neonicotinoids, which are particularly toxic toward invertebrates, were frequently detected and were further determined as major contributors to the toxic pressure based on the toxic unit approach integrating internal concentration and toxic potency. The total toxic pressure based on internal concentrations was substantially higher compared to when external concentrations were used. Thus, internal concentrations may add more value to the current environmental risk assessment that is typically based solely on external exposure.

AB  - The Rozprza motte-and-bailey residence in Central Poland was inhabited from the third decade of the 14th century up to the 15th century A.D. and functioned as a seat of a noble family. It was situated in the place occupied previously by an Early Medieval open settlement and a later ring-fort. The motte was constructed on the river terrace remnant adjoining a strongly expanding flood plain in the central part of the mid-Lucia River valley. The immediate surroundings of the stronghold were studied by means of archaeological excavations, detailed geological mapping (hand-auger transects and trenching), and large-scale aerial photography, as well as geochemical and geophysical (magnetic gradiometry and soil electrical resistance) prospection. All the results have been integrated within a GIS and supported by a set of C-14 dates that allow for a detailed geomorphological reconstruction of the stronghold situation, including former river patterns, the local flood plain development, and the history of the Medieval fortress site with its moats. Our research provides insights into the late Holocene evolution of a small river valley and confirms the favorable conditions for the location of the motte on a terrace remnant protected by the system of moats and surrounding paleochannels and swampy areas within the valley floor.

AB  - The rejection of roasted almonds by consumers is often due to the development of rancidity or textural changes. Dry-roasted 'Nonpareil' almonds were stored in polypropylene bags (PPB) in environmental chambers at 15, 25, 35 degrees C and 50 or 65% relative humidity (RH) or at 4 degrees C without RH control, and in high barrier bags (HBB) at 4, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C without RH control. Descriptive and consumer sensory testing as well as instrumental texture analyses were conducted on the samples over 16 months. Of the 11 samples, four (PPB/25 degrees C/65% RH, PPB/35 degrees C/50% RH, PPB/35 degrees C/65% RH, and HBB/35 degrees C) were rejected by consumers over the course of the study. Predictive models for the assessed attributes showed temperature to promote deterioration of almond acceptability, as determined by both consumer assessment and descriptive analysis. Storage in HBB mitigated acceptability losses at a scale of magnitude roughly comparable to that of 15-25 degrees C in storage temperature decreases. Univariate analysis showed that instrumental assessment of number of force peaks was a strong predictor of overall consumer acceptability (R-2 = 68.5%). It is recommended that industry members utilize force peaks assessment as an indicator of consumer acceptability, and consider reduced temperature storage and/or HBB for long-term storage of almonds.

AB  - Climate indicators related to Long Island Sound (LIS) water and air temperature variability were investigated. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and east Pacific/North Pacific (EP/NP) patterns are found to be strongly correlated with LIS air temperature anomalies during most seasons, especially during the winter. Additionally, the winter EP/NP index is strongly correlated with subsequent spring and summer LIS water temperature anomalies, potentially rendering the EP/NP index useful in extended LIS water temperature outlooks. Such lagged relationships are found to be related largely to the decorrelation time scale of seasonal water temperature anomalies. The atmospheric circulation pattern associated with anomalous LIS water temperature conditions is consistent with atmospheric Rossby wave trains emanating from the western equatorial Pacific. The EP/NP index has a characteristic time scale of approximately 5 to 10 years and such fluctuations are termed the quasi-decadal mode, the mode identified as varying coherently with LIS air and water temperature anomalies. Apparent PDO and EP/NP regime shifts in 1997 are found to coincide with a LIS water temperature regime shift. This result suggests that not all LIS warming experienced during recent decades is solely due to anthropogenic causes but rather is to some extent a result of natural variability. The results from this study provide a useful framework for both seasonal and decadal prediction of LIS water temperature variability.

AB  - Biotic communities in shallow northern lakes are frequently used to assess environmental change; however, complex interactions among multiple factors remain understudied. Here, we present analyses of a comprehensive data set that evaluates the influence input waters, catchment characteristics, limnology, and sediment properties on diatom and chironomid assemblages in surface sediments of similar to 49 shallow mainly thermokarst lakes in Old Crow Flats, Yukon. Multivariate analyses and ANOSIM tests identified that composition of diatom (119 taxa) and chironomid (68 taxa) assemblages differs significantly (p < 0.05) between lakes with snowmelt-versus rainfall-dominated input water. Redundancy analyses revealed strong correlation of limnological, sediment, and catchment variables with input waters. Variation partitioning analyses showed that unique effects of limnological variables account for the largest proportion of variation in diatom and chironomid assemblages (17.2% and 12.6%, respectively). Important independent roles of sediment properties (8.5% and 9.5%) and catchment characteristics (4.9% and 5.1%) were also identified. We suggest that the substantial variation shared among these classes (6.1% and 7.9%) is largely attributable to hydrological processes. Our study demonstrates the utility of multi-factor analysis in northern aquatic research and draws attention to the limitations of one-dimensional comparisons and their interpretations when modelling biotic responses to environmental change.

AB  - Soil quality assessment provides a tool for evaluating the sustainability of soils under different crop cafeterias. Our objective was to develop the soil quality index for evaluating the soil quality indicators under different cropping systems in northwest Himalaya-India. Composite soil samples were taken from the study area from different cropping systems which include T1 (forest soil control), T-2 (rice-oilseed, lower belts), T-3 (rice-oilseed, higher belts), T-4 (rice-oats), T-5 (rice-fallow), T-6 (maize-oats), T-7 (maize-peas), T-8 (apple), T-9 (apple-beans), and T-10 (apple-maize). Physical, chemical, and biological soil indicators were determined, and it was found that soil enzyme activities involved in nutrient cycling were significantly higher in forest soils, which were reflected in higher levels of available pool of nutrients. Carbon stocks were found significantly higher in forest soil which was translated in improved soil physical condition. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce multidimensionality of data followed by scoring by homothetic transformation of the selected indicators. Pearson's interclass correlation was performed to avoid redundancy, and highly correlated variables were not retained. Inclusion of legumes in the apple orchard floor recorded highest soil quality rating across the treatments. Cereal-based cropping systems were found inlower soil quality rating; however, the incorporation of peas in the system improved soil health.

AB  - In the present work, calcium diglyceroxide (CaDG) was synthesized by mechanochemical treatment of CaO dispersed in glycerol, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis (TGA/DTA), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Hammett indicator method for base strength determination. The obtained CaDG was tested as a catalyst in the methanolysis of sunflower oil under different working conditions: catalyst amount, agitation speed, temperature and methanol to oil molar ratio. The main advantage of CaDG used as a catalyst in methanolysis is related to the initial rate of methanolysis. According to many previously reported data in literature the mass transfer resistance controls the overall rate of methanolysis, but it is not observed with CaDG used as catalyst. Recently developed kinetic model that describes the complex methanolysis process was successfully applied for this system and model parameters were determined, supporting the explanation of the physical effect of the CaDG catalyst on the reduction of mass transfer resistance and increasing the rate of methanolysis. The absence of mass transfer rate at the beginning of process is a consequence of the nature of the CaDG, which is adsorbed at the droplet interfaces between methanol and oil leading to the formation of fine dispersion of these two immiscible liquids.

AB  - The role of mechanics in numerous biological processes is nowadays recognized, while in others, such as the fertilization process, it is still neglected. In the case of oocytes the description of their mechanical properties could improve the comprehension of the oocyte-spermatozoon interaction and be helpful for application in in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics. Herein the mechanical properties of whole human oocytes (HOs) immediately after retrieval are investigated by indentation measurements with atomic force spectroscopy under physiological conditions. Measurements are performed on immature (metaphase I-MI) and mature (metaphase II-MII) HOs. According to their morphological characteristics MII-HOs are classified as "suitable'' and "rejected''; these latter would be usually rejected for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). For all maturation stages we observe that the elastic response of the zona pellucida (ZP) outer layer was different and distinguishable from the rest of the ZP-HO. The elasticity of this ZP outer layer varies with maturation and quality: stiffness decreases from immature MI to good quality MII, up to poor-quality rejected MII. An indirect analysis with IVF outcome indicates that the ZP outer layer of analysed HOs donated by women who achieved pregnancy is stiffer than that of HOs from women with negative outcome. Our findings suggest that mechanical properties can represent important oocyte quality indicators that may be exploited for the design of innovative ICSI dedicated cell sorters.

AB  - Incipient motion experiments were conducted with natural gravel, acetate beads, and coarse-gravel-sized electronic grains called Smart Sediment Grains in a Small-Oscillatory Flow Tunnel. Measurements of fluid velocity were made using Particle Image Velocimetry. The strength of the fluid shear stresses and the pressure gradients were examined for a range of oscillatory flow conditions at the onset of motion of the sediment particles to determine which mechanism had induced particle motion. The three sediment types utilized in these experiments facilitated an assessment of the effects of sediment grain size diameter, shape, and density on incipient motion. Results suggested that the onset of sediment motion was dominated by the pressure gradients for flows with small orbital excursion amplitudes, by the shear stresses for flows with large orbital excursion amplitudes and by the combined effects for intermediate flows. The denser, angular gravel required greater free-stream accelerations to trigger sediment motion than the spherical, less dense acetate beads, and Smart Sediment Grains. A combined parameter for incipient motion that accounts for the simultaneous effects of both shear stresses and pressure gradients while depending on the static coefficient of friction and the packing concentration of the mobile bed layer was evaluated for accuracy using a range of sediment types. The results suggested that the combined parameter may be a better indicator of sediment mobilization under oscillatory flows than the typically assumed shear stress criterion.

AB  - This work was aimed to provide further information about toxicology of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on Vicia narbonensis L., considering different endpoints. After exposure to TiO2 nanoparticle suspension (mixture of rutile and anatase, size < 100 nm) at four different concentrations (0.2, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 aEuro degrees), the seeds of V. narbonensis were let to germinate in controlled environmental conditions. After 72 h, the extent of the success of the whole process (seed germination plus root elongation) was recorded as the vigour index, an indicator of possible phytotoxicity. After the characterisation of the hydric state of different materials, oxidative stress and enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant responses were considered as indicators of possible cytotoxicity and to assess if damage induced by TiO2 NPs was oxidative stress-dependent. Cytohistochemical detection of in situ DNA fragmentation as genotoxicity endpoint was monitored by TUNEL reaction. The treatments with TiO2 NPs in our system induced phytotoxic effects, ROS production and DNA fragmentation. The nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant responses were gradually and differentially activated and were able to maintain the oxidative damage to levels not significantly different from the control. On the other hand, the results of DNA fragmentation suggested that the mechanisms of DNA repair were not effective enough to eliminate early genotoxicity effects.

AB  - NZEB (Net zero energy building) is regarded as an integrated solution to address problems of energy-saving, environmental protection, and CO2 emission reduction in the building section. NZEB could be even possible with electricity production if enough renewable energy could be used. Moreover, various building-service systems with renewable energy sources have been widely considered for potential applications in NZEB. All of these new features extend the technical boundary of the conventional energy-efficient buildings, attach a more profound implication to the sustainable development of building technology, and therefore pose a challenge to evaluation works on NZEB performance.
   This paper presents a guided tour on NZEB evaluation through literature-research. An overview about definitions and energy-efficient measures of NZEB is presented so that the research object and technology boundary can be clarified for NZEB evaluation. Then, a summary of widely-used research method, tool and performance indicator in evaluation is provided for the methodology part. This part also includes a discussion on the application of LCA (life cycle assessment) in NZEB evaluation and LCA's role in promoting a well-defined NZEB. Finally, potential progress in NZEB evaluation with possible development trends is highlighted in terms of energy storage, load match and smart grid. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study identified middle school students who were less than delighted with their lives (reported life satisfaction scores between 1 and 6 on a 7-point scale), and attempted to improve these students' mental health via a 10-week group wellness-promotion intervention developed from prior applications of positive psychology research. Complete data at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up was gathered from 55 sixth grade students who were randomly assigned to the intervention condition (n = 28) or wait-list control (n = 27). Repeated measures analyses of a propensity score matched sample of 40 participants indicated a significant group by time interaction for global life satisfaction from baseline to post-intervention. Specifically, life satisfaction of students in the intervention group increased significantly, while the control group declined during the same period (although this change was not statistically significant). The intervention group's gains were maintained at follow-up, but were matched by similar gains for students in the control group. No effects of intervention group were identified in the indicators of affect or psychopathology. The improvements in life satisfaction evidenced by students in the intervention group during the first semester of middle school are important given the adjustment difficulties that often appear during this sensitive developmental period marked by biological and educational changes.

AB  - The leaching behaviour of a commercial fibre-cement sheet (FCS) product has been investigated. A static pH dependency test and a dynamic surface leaching test have been performed at lab scale. These tests allowed the development of a chemical-transport model capable to predict the release of major and trace elements over the entire pH range, in function of time.
   FCS exhibits a cement-type leaching behaviour with respect to the mineral species. Potentially hazardous species are released in significant quantities when compared to their total content. These are mainly heavy metals commonly encountered in cement matrixes and boron (probably added as biocide). Organic compounds considered as global dissolved carbon are released in significant concentrations, originating probably from the partial degradation of the organic fibres. The pesticide terbutryn (probably added during the preservative treatment of the organic fibres) was systematically identified in the leachates.
   The simulation of an upscaled runoff scenario allowed the evaluation of the cumulative release over long periods and the distribution of the released quantities in time, in function of the local exposure conditions. After 10 years of exposure the release reaches significant fractions of the species' total content - going from 4% for Cu to near 100% for B. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lake eutrophication (LE) has become an increasingly severe environmental problem recently. However, there has been no nutrient standard established for LE control in many developing countries such as China. This study proposes a structural equation model to assist in the establishment of a lake nutrient standard for drinking water sources in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau Ecoregion (Yungui Ecoregion), China. The modeling results indicate that the most predictive indicator for designated use-attainment is total phosphorus (TP) (total effect = -0.43), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) is recommended as the second important indicator (total effect = -0.41). The model is further used for estimating the probability of use-attainment associated with lake water as a drinking water source and various levels of candidate criteria (based on the reference conditions and the current environmental quality standards for surface water). It is found that these candidate criteria cannot satisfy the designated 100% use-attainment. To achieve the short-term target (85% attainment of the designated use), TP and CM-a values ought to be less than 0.02 mg/L and 1.4 mu g/L, respectively. When used as a long-term target (90% or greater attainment of the designated use), the TP and CM-a values are suggested to be less than 0.018 mg/L and 1 mu g/L, respectively.

AB  - Glycation occurs when glucose reacts non-enzymatically with proteins. This reaction depends upon time, ambient glucose concentration, and the molecular conformation of reactive amino acids. Little is known about protein glycation in fishes and the main objective of this study was to measure glycated hemoglobin (GHb) in rainbow trout, a glucose-intolerant species, under normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. We also identified GHb isoforms in vivo and analyzed the structural environment surrounding potential glycation sites. Despite similar glycemia to healthy humans, GHb was an order of magnitude lower in rainbow trout (0.6%) compared with humans (6%) and was not affected by long-term hyperglycemia. Species differences in GHb appear to be related to differences in erythrocyte glucose, and differential expression and glycation of hemoglobin (Hb) isoforms may explain intraspecific differences in rainbow trout GHb. Computer analysis of glucose isomers (ringed-open and alpha- and beta-pyranoses) interacting with the beta-chain of rainbow trout HbI and HbIV, and human HbA did not reveal structural or energetic constraints for glucose binding (the initial step of glycation) for rainbow trout Hbs. Overall, there are significant differences between Hb glycation in humans and rainbow trout, and GHb does not appear to be an accurate indicator of glycemia over time in rainbow trout.

AB  - The discovery of two new non-marine ameirids from the southern Yilgarn region significantly extends the geographic range for this group in Australia and exposes weaknesses in the conservation and environmental impact assessment (EIA) of subterranean species potentially threatened by mining developments. Megastygonitocrella embe, sp. nov. differs from seven previously described Australian congeners by the armature of the second leg endopod and absence of spinules on the somites. A key to world species of Megastygonitocrella is presented. Phylogenetic analysis based on 57 morphological characters and 30 species belonging to the Stygonitocrella s.l. group suggests that Antistygonitocrella pardalotos, gen. et sp. nov. has no close relatives anywhere in the world. Superficial similarities between the two new species are either plesiomorphies or homoplasies. The habitats of these new short-range endemic species are fractured-rock aquifers developed in Archaean greenstone, where the groundwater is characterised by acid conditions, high salinity and low dissolved oxygen. The population of A. pardalotos is threatened by a mining development. Despite the advanced level of environmental protection policy in Western Australia, our taxonomic study highlights limitations in EIA practices and discusses potential improvements which have global relevance in regions where short-range endemics coincide with extraction of mineral resources.

AB  - Background: Landscape fragmentation constitutes one of the most severe causes of global biodiversity loss.
   Aims: We studied Fagus sylvatica forests with different levels of fragmentation to address the following question: do fragmented and non-fragmented forests present a similar floristic composition and richness, structural parameters and ecological features?
   Methods: Vascular plant species were randomly sampled based on a beech forest map classified into three fragmentation levels. We compared overall native and diagnostic species richness patterns of the different fragmentation levels using rarefaction curves and the ratio between diagnostic and all species curves. We also contrasted different fragmentation levels of beech forests, focusing on floristic information, structural parameters, standard ecological features and the distribution of edge and clearing species.
   Results: Rarefaction analysis showed two opposite trends: the diversity of diagnostic species decreased in fragmented forests as the overall diversity increased. In highly fragmented forests, we found significantly higher values for therophyte and phanerophyte frequencies, light Ellenberg indicator values and edge and clearing species diversity.
   Conclusions: The integration of floristic analysis, particularly of certain diagnostic groups, with structural and ecological studies is more sensitive and significant than species richness alone, and could offer useful information for forest conservation and management.

AB  - Background: In an ongoing clinical trial, the genetic and environmental risk assessment (GERA) blood test offers subjects information about personal colorectal cancer risk through measurement of two novel low-to-moderate risk factors. We sought to examine predictors of uptake of the GERA blood test among participants randomized to the Intervention arm.
   Methods: Primary care patients aged 50 to 74 years eligible for colorectal cancer screening are randomized to receive a mailed stool blood test kit to complete at home (Control) or to the control condition plus an in-office blood test called GERA that includes assessment of red blood cell folate and DNA-testing for two MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Intervention). For the present study, baseline survey data are examined in participants randomized to the Intervention.
   Results: The first 351 intervention participants (161 African American/190 white) were identified. Overall, 249 (70.9%) completed GERA testing. Predictors of GERA uptake included race (African American race, odds ratio (OR) 0.51 (0.29 to 0.87)), and being more knowledgeable about GERA and colorectal cancer screening (OR 1.09 (1.01 to 1.18)). Being married (OR 1.81 (1.09 to 3.00)) was also significant in the multivariable model.
   Conclusions: Participant uptake of GERA testing was high. GERA uptake varied, however, according to socio-demographic background and knowledge.

AB  - Floristic variation is high in the Neotropics, but little is known about the factors shaping this variation at the mesoscale. We examined floristic composition and its relationship with environmental factors across 220 1-ha permanent plots in tropical lowland Bolivia. For each plot, abundance of 100 species (93 tree and 7 palm species >= 10 cm diam) was obtained. Climatic data, related to rainfall seasonality and temperature, were interpolated from all available weather stations in the region, and soil properties, related to texture and fertility, were obtained for each plot. Floristic variation was strongly associated with differences in water availability and temperature, and therefore the climatic gradient shaped floristic variation more strongly than the edaphic gradient. Detrended correspondence analysis ordination divided lowland Bolivia primarily into two major groups (Southern Chiquitano region vs. the Amazon region) and a multiple response permutation procedure distinguished five floristic regions. Overall, the tested environmental variables differed significantly among the five regions. Using indicator species analysis, we distinguished 82 strong indicator species, which had significant environmental preferences for one floristic region. These species can be used as indicators of environmental conditions or to determine which floristic region a certain forest belongs. Given the predicted decreases in rainfall and increases in temperature for tropical lowland forests, our gradient approach suggests that species composition may shift drastically with climate change.

AB  - The Sieversio montanae-Nardetum strictae is one of the most widespread plant communities in (sub-) alpine regions of the Alps. Our study examines the composition, ecology and distribution of this plant community in the Eastern Alps and addresses the issue of how the community is to be classified in the phytosociological system of Nardus-rich grasslands. Therefore, 357 vegetation relev,s were taken from the literature and 115 from our own inventories were recorded from 2005 to 2007 in Western Austria (mostly Tyrol) and Northern Italy (mostly South Tyrol). Additionally, indicator values of Ellenberg and land-use information were used to help better interpret the ecological site conditions of the subgroups. The HCA revealed there the existence of four groups of the Sieversio montanae-Nardetum strictae, which were classified to subassociations: (1) typicum, (2) vaccinietosum, (3) trifolietosum pratensis, and (4) seslerietosum albicantis. Besides the specific plant composition, altitude specifies the first, land-use intensity the second and third, and the pH of the topsoil the fourth subassociation. For the Eastern Alps, the plant community of the Sieversio montanae-Nardetum strictae should now be reclassified in the order of Nardetalia and the class of Calluno-Ulicetea. Finally, this plant community can be further classified by using the four above-mentioned subassociations.

AB  - The enhancement effect of polycarboxylic acids on reductive dechlorination transformation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) reacting with iron oxides was studied in anoxic suspension. Batch experiments were performed with three species of iron oxides (goethite, lepidocrocite and hematite) and four species of polycarboxylic acids (oxalate, citrate, succinate, and tartrate) through anoxic abiotic reactors. The chemical analyses and morphological observation from scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that different combinations between polycarboxylic acids and iron oxides produced distinct contents of Fe(II)-polycarboxylic ligand complexes, which significantly enhanced PCP transformation. Generation of the surface-bound Fe(II) depended on concentration of polycarboxylic acids. The optimal concentration for the enhancement was 2.0 mM oxalic acid. The dechlorination mechanism was further demonstrated by generation of chloride ions. The results suggest that surface-bound Fe(II) formed on the iron oxides surface appears to be a key factor in enhancing PCP transformation, and the mole ratio of oxalate to surface-bound Fe(II) (oxalate/Fe(II)) acted as an indicator of the enhancement effect. The enhancement mechanism attributes to strong nucleophilic ability and low reductive potential of the  Fe(II)-polycarboxylate complexes. Therefore, the enhancement effects might be helpful for understanding the natural attenuation of reducible organic pollutants at the interface of contaminated soil in anoxic condition.

AB  - Food has an influence on many life history traits related to dormancy in insects. In our previous study with the rice bug Leptocorisa chinensis (Dallas) (Hemiptera: Alydidae), diapausing females transferred to conditions physically favorable for promoting the gonad development required food intake to resume gonad development, whereas males did not. These differences in response to food between males and females lead to two questions: (1) Was diapause in the starved females completed? (2) Were the starved males that resumed gonad development at the same physiological status as fed males? We tested these questions with two physiological indicators: gonad status and respiratory rate. Results indicate that starved females are able to complete diapause, but show depressed respiration relative to well-fed insects in diapause. Similar to females, starved males that resumed postdiapause gonad development also had depressed respiratory rate, and hence physiological status is presumed to be different between starved and fed individuals. In this study, it was also found that the photoperiodic signal is storable, whereas the food signal acts directly. The adaptive significance of regulation of gonad development and respiratory metabolism in relation to phenology of suitable host plant and reproductive strategy is discussed in both sexes.

AB  - A significant reduction in phytoplankton biomass in the Ross Sea was reported in the austral summer of 2000-2001, a possible consequence of a disruption in sea-ice retreat due to the presence of an immense iceberg, B15 (1) (Fig. 1). Our observations in McMurdo Sound suggest temporally and trophically cascading impacts of that depression in productivity. Reduced phytoplankton stocks clearly affected the pteropod Limacina helicina (Phipps, 1774) (Gastropoda: Mollusca), an abundant primary consumer in the region (2, 3), as indicated by depressed metabolic rates in 2000-2001. The following season, for the first time on record, L. helicina was absent from McMurdo Sound. Many important predators, including whales and fishes, rely heavily on L. helicina for food (3, 4). However, most obviously impacted by its absence was Clione antarctica (Smith, 1902), an abundant pteropod mollusc (Gastropoda) that feeds exclusively on L. helicina (5). Metabolic rates of C. antarctica were depressed by 50% in 2001-2002. Both L. helicina and C. antarctica are important components Of polar ecosystems and may be good indicators of overall ecosystem "health" in McMurdo Sound and perhaps in the Ross Sea. In this last austral summer, 2002-2003, sea-ice extent was much higher and phytoplankton stocks were dramatically lower than any reported previously, effects possibly associated with El Nino conditions, and we hypothesize that pteropods and their consumers may be further impacted.

AB  - The principle indicator of river energy expenditure, stream power, has a significant influence on many forms and process attributes of the fluvial system, yet few basin-wide analyses of stream power variations have ever been conducted. Recent studies hypothesize a peak in the mean stream power distribution in small (10 km(2))- to intermediate (100 km(2))-sized basins. To test hypothetical stream power profiles in a high mountain setting, 129 cross-sections of stream networks within the Costilla basin of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado were measured for channel form, local sediment conditions, and basin characteristics. Geomorphic and hydrologic analysis of these river sites throughout the Costilla basin yielded evidence of abundant local control over fluvial processes and forms. Within the basin, the spatial deviations of stream power from the hypothetical patterns derived from hydraulic geometry, in some cases >200% deviation, match areas of specific geologic and hydrogeologic control. As an alternative to traditional hydraulic descriptions of downstream channel form, a probabilistic process-response model can incorporate local and basin-scale variables and allow more realistic feedback mechanisms than in traditional regime theory. The probabilistic nature of this type of model also allows prediction of multiple modes of channel adjustment, an ever-present challenge to extremal and physically based simulations.

AB  - We conducted a comprehensive regional spatial assessment of bacterial water quality in order to determine the points of entry of fecal pollution into a swimming beach area on Lake Michigan that historically has had numerous water quality advisories for elevated levels of Escherichia coli (E coli). Intensive, consecutive-day water samples were collected during dry and rainy conditions across multiple shoreline and offshore sites, and E coli levels were enumerated from these samples. For both dry and rainy days, shoreline sites demonstrated significantly higher E coli levels than offshore regions.. We found that offshore (10-150m from shore) E coli levels did not exceed 235 CFU/100 ml in more than 5% of the samples collected for 19 surveys (n = 209). In contrast, samples taken at the beach area exceeded 235 CFU/100 ml in 66% of the samples collected for 43 shoreline surveys (n = 675). Locally high E coli levels coincided with bird presence and stormwater at the swimming beach located within the marina, and were unrelated to E coli levels in connecting harbor waters. We conclude that beach water quality may be impacted by local, persistent contamination, which may confound routine beach monitoring and prevent the detection of regional pollution from other sources.

AB  - We examined high frequency fluctuations in water quality parameters in two tropical coastal plain estuaries in response to changing tidal flow conditions. The variability in total suspended sediments (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations, and indicators of water quality, including pH, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, over one spring tidal cycle during the early wet monsoon season was measured in two estuaries in eastern Sumatra. The relatively high rainfall experienced throughout the year, in combination with the recent extensive vegetation clearing and modification of the landscape, resulted in significant concentrations of TSS, VSS, and TOC being discharged to coastal waters. Maximum values are reached on the ebb tide (TSS > 1,013 mg l(-1); VSS > 800 mg l(-1); TOC > 60 mg l(-1)). The influence of freshwater discharge and tidal flow on water properties of the lower estuaries is also marked by the variability in salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH over the tidal cycle, with minimum values for each of these parameters following maximum current velocities and after the completion of the strong ebb tide. Estimation of seaward sediment fluxes, which are of significant interest in a region where rapid environmental change is occurring, would require further examination of sedimentary processes, such as resuspension and advection of sediment, as well as a consideration of neap-spring tidal variations and the effect of seasonality on estuarine circulation.

AB  - The species of vascular plants of the herb layer, were studied on ten forest sites representing pine forests of the alliance Dicrano-Pinion. These sites are located along the N-S transect in Northern and Central Europe, between 50degrees28' and 70degrees09' N - in Norway (NO1), Finland (FN1, FN2, FN3), Estonia (ES1), Latvia (LT1), Lithuania (LI1), and Poland (PL1, PL2, PL3). The relation was determined between the geographical location of these forests and the proportion in total species number and cover of the plants in the herb layer with known ecological; habitat and climatic requirements for light (L) and temperature (T) and soil requirements for moisture (F), acidity (R), and content of nitrogen(N). The indication method was applied using the species scale of Ellenberg et al. (1991), indicating the climatic and habitat requirements of the plant species on the basis of the values of the L, T, F, R and N in the macroclimatic gradient. The species which behave in a similar manner with respect to the habitat factors mentioned were clustered into the indicator species groups. The distinct directional changes of the share of these groups along the North-South transect were observed: 1) gradual appearance of the species characteristic for the moderately warm areas; 2) decrease of the share of the hygrophilous and acidophilous species.

AB  - In the present study, a TLC method for the analysis of gardenia yellow in foods using crocetin as an indicator was developed. Gardenia yellow was extracted from food samples with methanol or hydrous methanol, and after the extract was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in water and the pH was adjusted to 11 or above with 1 mol/L NaOH. The resultant mixture was occasionally stirred, then allowed to stand in a water bath at 50 degreesC for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the pH of the mixture was slightly acidified using hydrochloric acid. It was then purified through a C18 cartridge before being subjected to the TLC analysis.
   The TLC conditions were as follows: plate, RP-18F254S (Art. 15389, E. Merck); solvent system, acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran-0.1 mol/L oxalic acid (7:8:7). The visible absorption spectrum of the color was measured using scanning densitometry without isolation of the color. In order to investigate the capability of the present method, 37 commercial foods were analyzed, and their chromatographic behaviors and spectra were observed.
   The separation and the spectra obtained were not affected by coexisting substances in the foods, and the spots always gave the same Rf values and spectra as the standard, along with good reproducibility. The present method is considered to be useful for the rapid analysis of gardenia yellow in foods.

AB  - The pH of the isolated frog skin epithelium was determined on a cellular and subcellular level based on the distribution of a weak organic acid, 4-bromobenzoic acid. The indicator is detectable by X-ray microanalysis due to the presence of an element label. The results show that the pH of principal cells, but not the Na concentration, is closely correlated with the rate of transepithelial Na transport. Acidification leads to an inhibition of Na transport, regardless of whether the change was spontaneous or experimentally in duced. Under the conditions of this study, the pH of principal cells was not well regulated. At a bath pH of 7.0, large pH differences between the cell layers were detectable. In mitochondria-rich cells, the pH was a function of the intracellular Cl concentration but not the Na transport rate. The cytoplasmic pH consistently exceeded the nuclear pH. The nuclear cytoplasmic pH differential in principal cells amounted to 0.3 pH units, which is equivalent to a nuclear potential of -17 mV. The results support the view that the intracellular pH (pH(i)) is an important regulator of transepithelial Na transport. Regulation is primarily achieved at the level of the apical Na channel, making the Na influx the rate-limiting step in Na reabsorption.

AB  - Changes in intensity and composition of bioturbation and trace fossils in deep-sea settings are directly related to changes in environmental parameters such as food availability, bottom water oxygenation, or substrate consistency. Because trace fossils are practically always preserved in situ, and are often present in environments where other environmental indicators are scarce or may have been compromised or removed by diagenetic processes, the trace fossils provide an important source of paleoenvironmental information in regions such as the deep Arctic Ocean. Detailed analysis of X-ray radiographs from 12 piston and gravity cores from a transect spanning from the Makarov Basin to the Yermak Plateau via the Lomonosov Ridge, the Morris Jesup Rise, and the Gakkel Ridge reveal both spatial and temporal variations in an ichnofauna consisting of Chondrites, Nereites, Phycosiphon, Planolites, Scolicia, Trichichnus, Zoophycos, as well as deformational biogenic structures. The spatial variability in abundance and diversity is in close correspondence to observed patterns in the distribution of modern benthos, suggesting that food availability and food flux to the sea floor are the most important parameters controlling variations in bioturbation in the Arctic Ocean. The most diverse ichnofaunas were observed at sites on the central Lomonosov Ridge that today have partially ice free conditions and relatively high summer productivity. In contrast, the most sparse ichnofauna was observed in the ice-infested region on the Lomonosov Ridge north of Greenland. Since primary productivity, and therefore also the food flux at a certain location, is ultimately controlled by the geographical position in relation to ice margin and the continental shelves, temporal variations in abundance and diversity of trace fossils have the potential to reveal changes in food flux, and consequently sea ice conditions on glacial-interglacial time scales. Down core analysis reveal clearly increased abundance and diversity during interglacial/interstadial intervals that were identified through strongly enhanced Mn levels and the presence of micro- and nannofossils. Warm stages are characterized by larger trace fossils such as Scolicia, Planolites or Nereites, while cold stages typically display an ichnofauna dominated by small deep penetrating trace fossils such as Chondrites or Trichichnus. The presence of biogenic structures in glacial intervals clearly show that the Arctic deep waters must have remained fairly well ventilated also during glacials, thereby lending support to the hypothesis that the conspicuous brown layers rich in Mn which are found ubiquitously over the Arctic basins are related to input from rivers and coastal erosion during sea level high-stands rather than redox processes in the water column and on the sea floor. However, the X-ray radiograph study also revealed the presence of apparently post-sedimentary, diagenetically formed Mn-layers which are not directly related to Mn input from rivers and shelves. These observations thus bolster the hypothesis that the bioturbated, brownish Mn-rich layers can be used for stratigraphic correlation over large distances in the Arctic Ocean, but only if post sedimentary diagenetic layers can be identified and accounted for in the Mn-cycle stratigraphy.

AB  - The alpine wetlands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have degraded in recent decades. However, the response of the soil food web to the degradation is still unclear. Four habitats including a wet meadow (WM), a grassland meadow (GM), a moderately degraded meadow (MDM) and a severely degraded meadow (SDM) (sandy meadows) were selected along the degrees of degradation. The soil macrofaunal biomass and the environmental factors of vegetation and soil were investigated. The soil macrofaunal community biomass increased significantly from WM to MDM and decreased to a very small amount in SDM, with most taxa disappearing. The biomass of the trophic groups of detritivores, herbivores and predators exhibited similar responses to soil macrofaunal communities. The relative biomass of detritivores increased from WM to MDM, but herbivores responded in an opposite manner, resulting in the dominant trophic group and trophic structure varying progressively from WM to GM to MDM. Soil properties but not vegetation determined the changes in trophic groups and trophic structure. The results implied that the higher trophic levels (carnivores or omnivores) responded more sensitively than the lower trophic levels (herbivores) to alpine wetland degradation. Our results also suggested that soil macrofauna have a habitat-specific characteristic trophic structure and can be used as indicators of soil health conditions. (C) Higher Education Press 2021

AB  - Damage detection based on modal parameter changes has become popular in the last few decades. Nowadays, there are robust and reliable mathematical relations available to predict natural frequency changes if damage parameters are known. Using these relations, it is possible to create databases containing a large variety of damage scenarios. Damage can be thus assessed by applying an inverse method. The problem is the complexity of the database, especially for structures with more cracks. In this paper, we propose two machine learning methods, namely the random forest (RF), and the artificial neural network (ANN), as search tools. The databases we developed contain damage scenarios for a prismatic cantilever beam with one crack and ideal and non-ideal boundary conditions. The crack assessment was made in two steps. First, a coarse damage location was found from the networks trained for scenarios comprising the whole beam. Afterwards, the assessment was made involving a particular network trained for the segment of the beam on which the crack was previously found. Using the two machine learning methods, we succeeded in estimating the crack location and severity with high accuracy for both simulation and laboratory experiments. Regarding the location of the crack, which was the main goal of the practitioners, the errors were less than 0.6%. Based on these achievements, we concluded that the damage assessment we propose, in conjunction with the machine learning methods, is robust and reliable.

AB  - The article presents the problem of contamination of non-flow anthropogenic reservoir with intensive recreational use with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the conditions of the small forest catchment. The seasonal and spatial variability of the tested substances was determined. In water, the total PAHs ranged from 0.0222 to 0.128 mu g/L in spring, from 0.0853 to 1.35 mu g/L in summer, from values below the quantification limit to 0.130 mu g/L in autumn and from 0.0691 to 0.264 mu g/L in winter. While, in sediments ranged from 49.0 mu g/kg dry matter (DM) to 390 mu g/kg DM in spring, from 77.6 to 272 mu g/kg DM in summer, from 111 to 446 mu g/kg DM in autumn and from 42.6 to 347 mu g/kg DM in winter. There was no correlation between the concen-tration of total PAHs and selected water parameters, and strong linear relationships between the sum of PAHs and, individually, dry matter, mineral matter, and volatile matter of the sediments were observed. It was determined that PAHs in the sediments are potentially pyrogenic, and the concentrations of these compounds were below levels thought to be toxic to benthic organisms.

AB  - Bioemulsifying compounds are intracellular (IPS) and extracellular (EPS) biopolymers produced naturally by microorganisms during their growth and have been the interest of many researchers due to their biodegradability and potential to replace conventional emulsifiers. Large-scale production of bioemulsifying compounds is still limited because of the high processing cost. Therefore, this study focuses on the production of such compounds using the fungus Phoma dimorpha supplemented with low-cost substrates. Agroindustrial residues were used as the additional carbon source in submerged fermentation, such as glycerol from the biodiesel industry, brewer's spent grain, and rice bran. The effects of these carbon sources were evaluated on the production of IPS and EPS, biomass concentration, pH, density, surface tension, emulsification index, and bioherbicidal activity. In general, the best results were found for the fermented broth obtained when 5% (w/v) of crude glycerol was supplemented. The main results in this condition were the highest EPS yield of 5.48 g/L, IPS yield of 0.072 g/L, biomass concentration of 12.8 g/L, the highest emulsification index of 70%, and the lowest surface tension of 51.85 mN/m. The supplementation with glycerol increased the concentration of EPS in the medium and the emulsification index without affecting IPS production and biomass concentration. It also showed faster action against bioindicators and more satisfactory results for bioherbicidal activity.

AB  - Domestication and selective breeding can mitigate current bottlenecks in European perch aquaculture. Monitoring the condition and stress tolerance of European perch stocks from different recirculating aquaculture systems is of general interest to set the baseline values of promising candidates for further breeding processes. We recorded morphometric, behavioural (critical swimming speed, activity, aggressiveness, propensity to approach a novel object), and physiological parameters (plasma cortisol, glucose, ion concentrations, enzyme activity levels) after stress induction across four European perch stocks obtained from different aquaculture facilities in France (I and II), Denmark, and Hungary. The European perch stock from Denmark revealed the population with the most pronounced activity pattern. This was reflected by the highest relative swimming speed and a high percentage of bold-exploratory behaviour, which coincides with increased aggressive interactions within this stock. Additionally, we detected a higher tolerance to adverse environmental challenges in the perch stock from Denmark compared with the stocks from France and Hungary. The observed characteristics suggest that the stock from Denmark has a higher potential in the future framework of selective-breeding assessment. Further in-depth research is required to elucidate which traits and genetic as well as epigenetic components accelerate the domestication processes of European perch aquaculture and promote selective breeding processes.

AB  - The article discusses the static and dynamic properties of high-strength, boron-containing Hardox 600 steel that is resistant to abrasive wear, both in its delivery state and after normalization. Since the available published material in the literature does not have any real mechanical indicators of the abovementioned steel, a static tension test was carried out at an ambient temperature. The steel's tensile strength, yield strength, Young's modulus, elongation and reduction of area were determined from the test. The Charpy impact test at temperatures of -40 degrees C, -20 degrees C, 0 degrees C, and +20 degrees C and fractographic analysis were performed to determine the transition temperature of ductility to brittleness. In dynamic load conditions, the assigned values of impact energy do not always truly determine the material behavior. Thus, the aim of the fractography was to provide precision when determining the behavior. A significant difference in the impact energy of the tested steel with respect to its heat treatment and ductile-brittle transition temperature was observed and determined based on the impact test result, as well as the nature of the fracture. On the basis of the determined structural and strength characteristics, an analysis of the possibility of application of Hardox 600 steel on selected elements of working machines was performed.

AB  - Environmental management often benefits from leaching assessment as a predictive tool for estimating constituent leaching from solid and waste materials. The Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) provides both validated tests methods for characterizing materials and a methodology for developing screening assessments based on material characterization results. The use of LEAF data in a screening-level environmental assessment approach is demonstrated through a hypothetical case study of copper/lead smelter soil remediation. The LEAF test methods characterize leaching behavior from a wide range of materials as either constituent liquid-solid partitioning as functions of pH and liquid-to solid ratio (L/S) or as a rate of constituent mass transport. In this study, leaching characteristics of a contaminated smelter soil and the same soil treated by solidification/stabilization with Portland cement were compared to hypothetical environmental thresholds. Screening assessments were developed for total content, available content, and maximum concentrations over relevant pH domains and L/S ranges. Assessment ratios for barium, beryllium, and fluoride indicated that estimated leaching would be less than thresholds in both materials and these constituents were removed from further analysis. Similarly, chromium (in soil) and zinc (in solidified material) were screened from further analysis. For the remaining constituents, scenario-based assessment could refine estimated leaching concentrations by considering anticipated conditions of leaching scenario. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The world's declining plant biodiversity depends on the efficacy of many policy tools, including Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). While scholars have long been trying to understand how biodiversity information affects EIA decision-making, very few studies have addressed the specific challenges associated with threatened plant species. Based on content analysis of 83 EIA processes that proposed vegetation removals in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, this study evaluated the extent to which threatened plant species were considered in decision-making. The study found that the developers of 31 projects (37% of the 83 analyzed EIA projects) disclosed the occurrence of threatened plant species in the potentially affected areas. The detailed content analysis of their respective Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) review reports revealed that the majority of the identified impacts and respective compensation programs targeted tree habits, and under a variety of rationales. Developers' proposed compensation rates of impacted tree species varied from 1:1 to 50:1. The reviewing process reported issues related mostly to the baseline conditions. Overall, the study found that EIA, in Minas Gerais state, has been functioning mainly as a diagnostic and compensation tool for the removal of tree species. The study calls for improvements in existing legislation and the development of technical guidance and capacity-building programs for EIA stakeholders.

AB  - In order to enhance the investment efficiency and improve environmental quality, this study takes the industrial structure and the investment efficiency of regional environmental pollution control as the research objective, and studies the relationship between them. A non-parametric statistical method is designed through linear programming with multiple input indicators and output indicators. The convex conditions are introduced to solve the problem of distinguishing between technical efficiency and scale efficiency in the industrial structure. Then the dynamic productivity of decision-making units is evaluated according to the influence of the relative index of industrial structure on the change of productivity level, and the industrial structure productivity is measured by combining the directional distance function to show the influence of time-based dynamic changes. Finally, the industrial structure and environmental pollution control investment efficiency are respectively set as explanatory variables and explained variables, and the influence relationship between these two variables is explored. Selecting the environmental pollution control investment in a city for ten consecutive years as the research target of the impact of the industrial structure, the experiment found that the industrial structure and the efficiency of governance investment are significantly positively correlated. Adjusting the industrial structure can effectively improve the efficiency of environmental pollution control. A scientific and reasonable industrial structure has a certain boosting effect on environmental sustainable development.

AB  - The widespread existence of antibiotics has caused inevitable influence on ecology and humans. In this study, we screened the most commonly used antibiotics, and 64 antibiotics were detected in Shanghai, an international metropolis. Most of the target substances were detected in all 46 water samples including main rivers and districts in Shanghai, with concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 502.43 ng L-1. In particular, sulfadiazine (502.43 ng L-1) had the highest maximum concentration. Besides, risk quotients based on fish suggested that sulfonamides had a medium risk (0.12) in Shanghai. Correlation studies had shown that most compounds with frequencies exceeding 60% were significantly positively correlated with the total concentration. Based on further analysis, sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, and sulfapyridine were screened as indicators to reflect the pollution status of antibiotics in Shanghai for a long time. The screening conditions for these indicators include detection rate (> 60%), maximum concentration (> 100 ng L-1), RQ (> 0.01), and correlation (> 0). In addition, population density may be the main factor for antibiotic pollution through regional comparison. In a word, this work can systematically reflect the overall situation of Shanghai antibiotics and provide support for global data comparison in the future. Meanwhile, we provided the potential indicators that can be applied in the long term and economical monitoring of antibiotics.

AB  - Changes in land use in the catchments and areas near the shorelines of lakes may have undesirable consequences for the functioning of lake ecosystems. We studied temporal changes in physicochemical parameters and benthic microbial processes within the small Lake Gulbinas (Lithuania) in relation to the type of land use in the catchment. We compared the period when agriculture activity decreased and increased urban development commenced (2001-2002, transition period) with periods of intense urban land use (2007, 2014-2015). The results were compared to reference data from earlier agricultural periods (1962, 1987-1989). The highest nutrient concentrations in the water were observed during the period of agriculture activity, while increased phosphate concentrations in the near-bottom water and increased organic carbon content and microbial activity in the lake sediments were observed during the period of intense urban land use. Throughout the latter period, anaerobic mineralization of organic carbon via sulfate reduction in bottom sediments was significantly higher than that during the transition period. The intensification of benthic sulfate reduction led to sulfide increase and, thus, to a higher phosphate mobility re-fertilizing the water. Our study suggests that, with a shift of land usage in catchment areas from agricultural to urban, increasing sedimentary organic carbon and its intensive anaerobic mineralization may stimulate internal eutrophication of small lakes.

AB  - Area (LA) estimation, based on individual leaf dimensions [length (L) and width (W)], was addressed in olive tree. Ten cultivars exposed to two watering regimes (irrigated versus rainfed) under field conditions were examined. Petiole length, leaf L, W, perimeter, base and apex angles, four shape indicators, together with LA were digitally assessed in fully-expanded leaves (480 leaves per treatment; 9.600 leaves in total). Large cultivar differences mainly in leaf size and secondarily in leaf shape were apparent. All parameters were affected by water deficit, but to a cultivar dependent extent. Leaf size was generally reduced by lack of irrigation in most cultivars. LA was estimated with higher accuracy by employing L alone, as compared to W alone, in eight cultivars. LA estimation was always improved by considering both L and W simultaneously, as compared to a single dimension. By studying each cultivar individually, LA estimation was within accepted limits (0.71 <= R-2 <= 0.92) in nine cultivars, whereas in the tenth one a moderate R-2 (0.63) was obtained. The accuracy of this estimation was not improved by pooling the data of all cultivars. Watering did not significantly affect the relation between estimated and measured LA. The obtained data indicate that a universal LA estimation model for olive tree carries the pitfall of moderate accuracy, owing only to cultivar differences, since environmental effects were trivial.

AB  - The influence of different photoperiods was studied on the growth and behaviour of the giant gourami, Trichogaster fasciata. Fish (weight=1.1g; length=4.36cm) were subjected to photoperiod regimes of 0 L: 24 D, 8 L: 16 D, 12 L: 12 D and 16 L: 8 D for 90 days in triplicates. The growth rate was highest (weight=4g) and lowest (weight=2.36g) in the groups subjected to 16L: 8D and 0 L: 24 D photoperiods respectively. The mean body weight and mean total length were significantly higher (p < 0.05) while standard length and caudal fin length (p > 0.05) were not significant in the 16 hours light. Mean values of food conversion ratio and condition factor were lowest while various growth parameters were found to be maximum in the 16 hours light. 16 L: 8 D photoperiod regime produced pronounced effects on the welfare of giant gourami as shown by the nonintrusive welfare indicators. The photoperiodic signals were found to be capable of modifying the behavioural activities where male aggression related to territory or defence and female selection were reduced in control group. The optimum photoperiod (16 L: 8 D) was an environmental cue for the better growth, welfare and behaviour.

AB  - Immobilized metal affinity chromatography has drawn great attention as a widespread separation and purification approach. In this work, ruthenium was firstly introduced into the preparation of immobilized metal affinity chromatography considering its affinity to N, O-donor ligands. A beta-cyclodextrin-functionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate-ethylene dimethacrylate) monolith was designed and employed as the supporting material in immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Thiosemicarbazide was introduced into the synthesis process, which not only acted as a bridge between beta-cyclodextrin and glycidyl methacrylate, but also chelated with ruthenium because of its mixed hard-soft donor characteristics. The developed monolithic ruthenium(III)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography column was utilized for the adsorption and separation of hippuric acid, a biological indicator of toluene exposure. To achieve high extraction capacity, the parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated with an orthogonal experiment design, L9 (3(4)). Under the optimized conditions, the enrichment factor of hippuric acid was 16.7-fold. The method reproducibility was investigated in terms of intra-and interday precisions with relative standard deviations lower than 8.7 and 9.5%, respectively. In addition, ruthenium(III)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography material could be used for up to 80 extractions without an apparent change in extraction recovery.

AB  - The subject of this article is the entrepreneurial activity of the population residing in the post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and its goal is to identify different types of ecosystems of entrepreneurship in these countries by means of analyzing entrepreneurial activity in various countries/groups of countries considered in the context of their societal and economic development. Empirically this article is based upon data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). On the basis of an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches in the relevant literature to the taxonomy of business ecosystems, using a set of key country-level indicators of the GEM for 2011, this article proposes a taxonomy for entrepreneurship ecosystems based on two "axes" - the quality of entrepreneurial activity (high, average, below average) and the state of the entrepreneurial framework conditions in the respective countries (favorable, average, below average). The result is a clustering of CEE countries' entrepreneurship ecosystems, where the worst cluster consists solely of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the best contains the Czech Republic. Russia belongs to a cluster with mid-level indicators along both axes. The results might be used to implement a more focused policy promoting entrepreneurship and support for small businesses, which must move away from generalized schemes towards concrete policy concepts taking into account the resources and limitations of each of the selected types of entrepreneurship ecosystems.

AB  - Aims We evaluated whether habitat association is consistent between two tree life history stages, young and adult, and whether spatial gradients explain species composition variation.
   Methods We investigated habitat association of tree assemblages using multivariate regression tree analysis (MRT). Habitat preference was assayed using indicator species analysis. We addressed the contribution of pure environment (i.e. habitat), spatially structured environment and pure space on species composition variation using variation partitioning by partial redundancy analysis (pRDA). Principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) were used to produce spatial regressors.
   Results Habitat association changed during plant ontogeny. Flooding depth explained differences in species composition at young tree stages. Distribution pattern of adult trees was explained by spatial variation in soil fertility. Pure space explained a higher fraction of community variability of young trees (16 %) than habitat (5 %). In contrast, adult trees were structured mostly by habitat (10 %).
   Conclusions Niche expansion was observed along tree ontogeny, with adult trees occupying a wider range of flooding conditions. The higher effect of pure space on young tree distribution highlights the importance of distance-dependent processes (e.g. dispersal) on the variation in community composition. The large unexplained component resulted from variation partitioning indicates that stochastic environmental events (e.g. climate histories) might contribute to explaining tree assemblage dynamics in the Pantanal system.

AB  - Corrosive and aggressive water needs alkalization at different stages of treatment, what may be achieved by using deacidifying materials. The deacidifying properties of raw melaphyre as well as impact of its heat treatment at 550 degrees C and 900 degrees C on intensification of the aforementioned properties were investigated. The experiments relied on contact of demineralized water with the raw and calcined melaphyre samples under static (batch test) and dynamic (flow-through column test) conditions. Changes in water quality following its contact with melaphyre were analyzed on the basis of standard physico-chemical indicators. It was demonstrated that the raw melaphyre increased the pH, total alkalinity and total hardness of water, while improved its mineralization and decreased the acidity. The heat treatment at 550 degrees C had no impact on the deacidifying properties of melaphyre, while treatment at 900 degrees C resulted in a strongly alkalizing and water remineralizing material. Its deacidifying properties were unstable and leaching of mobile alkali from the calcined melaphyre occurred. Demineralized water leached the compounds of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium, both from the natural and calcined melaphyre, which was indicated by water alkalinity. Both the raw melaphyre and calcined at 550 degrees C led to an increase in the total water alkalinity purely due to the carbonates. The total water alkalinity coming from the water contact with the calcined melaphyre at 900 degrees C consisted mostly of hydroxides and carbonates to some extent.

AB  - OJIP analysis, which explores changes in photosystem II (PSII) photochemical performance, has been used as a measure of plant susceptibility to stress. However, in the case of freezing tolerance and winter hardiness, which are highly environmentally variable, the use of this method can give ambiguous results depending on the species as well as the sampling year and time. To clarify this issue, we performed chlorophyll fluorescence measurements over three subsequent winters (2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13) on 220 accessions of common winter wheat and 139 accessions of winter triticale. After freezing, leaves were collected from cold-acclimated plants in the laboratory and field-grown plants. Observations of field survival in seven locations across Poland and measurements of freezing tolerance of the studied plants were also recorded. Our results confirm that the OJIP test is a reliable indicator of winter hardiness and freezing tolerance of common wheat and triticale under unstable winter environments. Regardless of species, the testing conditions giving the most reliable results were identical, and the reliability of the test could be easily checked by analysis of some relationships between OJIP-test parameters. We also found that triticale is more winter hardy and freezing tolerant than wheat. In addition, the two species were characterized by different patterns of photosynthetic apparatus acclimation to cold.

AB  - We investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of pine (Pinus sylvestris) stumps preserved in peat deposits to test whether their occurrence can be used as an indicator of climatic shifts to drier conditions. Radiocarbon dates of sub-fossil stumps were collected from the literature, along with environmental data throughout the island of Ireland. Data were analysed using non-parametric statistical techniques. There was no distinct geographical pattern observed in the distribution of pine stumps on bog surfaces. Tree ages ranged from 66 to 500 years with 85.7% of these <300 years. Pines occurred on bogs from ca. 8500 to 500 cal a BP. The temporal distribution during the Holocene was characterized as a mid-Holocene peak in sites supporting pine, with two gaps either side of this peak. Our current understanding of past climate dynamics failed to explain this temporal distribution. The onset, mid-Holocene peak and cessation of bog sites supporting the presence of bog pines appears to be driven by changes in pine seed and bog surface area availability during the Holocene rather than changes in climate. We conclude that variability in the occurrence of Irish bog pines is not a valid climate proxy as factors other than climate influence their presence and thereby disrupt the climate signals.

AB  - Algae are appropriate target organisms both for the development of toxicological assays and as bioindicators of marine degradation by inorganic and organic compounds. In recent years, the compounds ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) and nitrilotriacetic (NTA) acids have been released from household and industrial processes and have been considered to be the major emerging contaminants in aquatic environments because they form higher, stable complexes with essential and unessential cations, lowering the bioavailabilities and toxicities of these metals. In the present work, the toxicity relationships of cadmium, copper, zinc, and lead, either free or available and after complexation by EDTA and NTA ions, were evaluated because these complexes may have contributed to the modification of cations toxicity under the experimental conditions. The assay is based on the daily growth rates of the red seaweed Gracilaria domingensis (Gracilariales, Rhodophyta) in synthetic seawater during a 48-h exposure. The ratios of free ions (aqueous complex) were calculated by software minimization of the total equilibrium activity (MINTEQA2). The toxicity of uncomplexed Cd, Cu, Zn, and Cu cations decreased with increasing EDTA ion concentrations because of the formation of metal complexes. The increasing NTA agents successfully mitigated the free-metal toxicity effects with the exception of that of Cu-NTA. The results suggest that there are relationships between toxicity for algae and free ions in solution.

AB  - The Gulf of Kachchh Marine National Park and Sanctuary (MNPS) has one of the four coral reef systems of India. However, owing to its unique geographical position, this area has been transformed into an industrial hub dominated by oil and gas production, refining and transportation facilities. This study investigates the status of macrobenthos along with associated hydro-sedimentological data at 30 stations, sampled within three industrially active zones of the MNPS. The bottom water and sediment characteristics recorded in the study area fulfil the prescribed criteria for ecosensitive zones of India, despite the various stressors operational in the region. The univariate parameters suggest a healthy macrobenthic community except for a few pockets of stressed environment. However, CCA and correlation analyses indicate that even at low levels, petroleum hydrocarbons, along with sediment texture, were influencing polychaete community structure. As this protected area is denoted a "high oil spill risk area", polychaete/amphipod ratio was employed to verify the environmental status which revealed that a major part of the study area had a good representation of oil-sensitive amphipods. The current study is the first of its kind to provide valuable baseline data of macrobenthos along with prevailing environmental conditions in this ecosensitive area. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The narrow clawed crayfish, Astacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz, 1823 is the only native freshwater crayfish species of Turkey. Crayfish are standard test organism in the OECD Testing Guidelines and has importance in ecotoxicological studies/environmental monitoring programs due to its critical position in the food web and lake bottom feeding habits. Crayfish (males and non-ovigerous females; 9.77 +/- 0.66 cm total length, 24.82 +/- 2.96 g weight) hemolymph were collected and analyzed for total hemocyte count and hemolymph were biochemical parameters reference range for the species by autoanalyzer. Animals were maintained under laboratory conditions for 2 weeks before measurements. All biochemical parameters, except chloride and lactic acid, showed normal distribution when tested for normality with the using Kolmogorov Smirnov (K-S) test. The means and standard deviations of biochemical parameters analyzed are; glucose (4.8 +/- 2.8 mg/dL), calcium (38.07 +/- 5.67 mg/dL), magnesium (4.305 +/- 1.479 mg/dL), potassium (4.795 +/- 1.057 mequiv/L), sodium (190.3 +/- 15.1 mequiv/L), total protein (2.578 +/- 1.005 g/dL). These results provide necessary reference hemolymph intervals for future studies of A. leptodactylus to be used as model organism, and ecotoxicological indicator species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fish growth is an indicator of populations' life conditions that could be used to detect stress due to contamination. In this study, age of fishes of four species (Psectrogaster essequibensis, Schizodon fasciatus, Triportheus angulatus and Pygocentrus nattereri) from the It,nez basin (Upper Madera, Amazon) were estimated by otolith readings, and growth parameters were estimated by using the Von Bertalanffy Growth Function. Populations of four sites were compared in order to detect the effect of natural and anthropogenical water chemistry differences. One of these sites was directly impacted by gold mining activities whereas the three others were only influenced by mild human activities and presented white or clear waters. Species growth coefficient (K) varied from 0.28 (P. nattereri), to 0.39 (P. essequibensis), 0.69 (S. fasciatus) and 1.71 (T. angulatus). Due to the limited size samples, these values have to be considered as preliminary regional approximation. For S. fasciatus, P. nattereri and T. angulatus, residuals analysis of the growth function showed differences among the three unimpacted sites. However, each species exhibited different patterns of growth variations among sites, thus preventing to clearly demonstrate a general effect of water chemistry on the fish growth of these populations. On the contrary, for these three species fish growth appeared weaker in the gold-mining site.

AB  - Pinus gerardiana Wall. locally known as 'chilgoza' is near endemic and endangered to Himalayan region. The species has aptly been described as the "Champion of Rocky Mountains" as it grows under extremely rough site conditions. Being a flavorsome wild edible, the chilgoza pine nuts have high demand in local, national and international markets and fetch very high prices. Due to rampant harvesting of cones, natural regeneration of this species is being fatally hampered. In present study, the natural regeneration assessment of the species was conducted in the forests of Kinnuar of Himachal Pradesh, India. The whole distribution area of the species was divided into three zones, viz., Dry temperate, Semi arid and Arid. The sampling plots of 20m x 20m were selected in which the regeneration sampling quadrates of 2m x 2m were laid in the eastern and western bank of river Sutlej. The results revealed that the semiarid zone on the western aspect of the area have maximum established regeneration of the species (291.66 plants/ha). Overall, the mean natural regeneration status of the species was very poor (15%). Thus, the species is facing higher risk of extinction and needs to be considered as 'Critically Endangered' in Indian Himalayan Region. It is suggested here that a suitable strategy and action plan including sustainable harvesting methods should be prepared and implemented on priority basis.

AB  - This research examines the diet and subsistence strategies during the Early Bronze Age III (EB III) or/and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age IV (EB IV) and the Middle Bronze Age I-II (MB I-II) periods of Tell al-Husn, northern Jordan. Stable isotope analyses of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were carried out on human teeth of known ages. Faunal samples were radiocarbon dated, while their carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotopes were analyzed for comparative purposes. The results revealed that the diet of the individuals of the MB I is richer in terrestrial animal protein than the individuals of the EB III and/or early EB IV and MB II, a probable indicator for more agricultural activities toward the end of the MB and the LB and during the EB III and/or early EB IV. The results suggested that the individuals of tomb 2 are probably of higher social status or were subjected to different environmental conditions compared to the individuals of chamber 3 of tomb 1. In addition, the results suggested a higher social status for an individual buried contemporaneously with other individuals in chamber 3 of tomb 1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Indicators of temperament appear early in infancy and remain relatively stable over time. Despite a great deal of interest in biological indices of temperament, most studies of infant temperament rely on parental reports or behavioral tasks. Thus, the extent to which commonly used temperament measures relate to potential biological indicators of infant temperament is still relatively unknown. The current experiment examines the relationship between a common parental report measure of temperament - the Infant Behavior Questionnaire - Revised (IBQ-R) - and measures of frontal EEG asymmetry in infants. We examined associations between the subscales of the IBQ-R and frontal EEG asymmetry scores recorded during a combined series of neutral attentional and putatively emotional recording conditions in infants between 7 and 9 months of age. We predicted that approach-related subscales of the IBQ-R (e. g., Approach, Soothability) would be related to greater left prefrontal asymmetry, while withdrawal-related subscales (e. g., Distress to Limitations, Fear, Falling Reactivity, Perceptual Sensitivity) would be related to greater right prefrontal asymmetry. In the mid- and lateral-frontal regions, Approach, Distress to Limitations, Fear, Soothability, and Perceptual Sensitivity were generally associated with greater left frontal activation (rs >=.23, ps<0.05), while only Falling Reactivity was associated with greater right frontal activation (rs <=-.44, ps<0.05). Results suggest that variability in frontal EEG asymmetry is robustly associated with parental report measures of temperament in infancy.

AB  - The surface flow constructed wetland (SF CW) in Can Cabanyes (Granollers, Catalonia, northeastern Spain) was created as a part of a series of activities aimed at restoring a highly impacted fluvial peri-urban zone. The system is fed with a small part of the secondary effluent, which is not completely nitrified, from an urban wastewater treatment plant. Effluents in the SF CW were sampled between 2003 and 2006 for physical and chemical parameters and faecal bacteria indicators. In addition, 8 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were measured in June 2005 and February 2006. The system showed a good reliability for ammonium and faecal bacteria removal, with average ammonium efficiencies between 64 and 87% and a removal of approximately 2 logarithmic units of Faecal Coliforms. A clear seasonal trend was observed for ammonium. The results for PPCPs demonstrated that the wetland has a good capacity for removing a large variety of these compounds; the removal efficiencies were higher than 70% for most of them, with the exception of clofibric acid (34%) and carbamazepine (39%). Although the chemical oxygen demand and total suspended solid removal rates were either low or zero because of the permanent eutrophic conditions of the system and the low incoming concentrations, the effluent quality is generally considered to be quite good.

AB  - Reports of geographic variation in behavior and morphology among prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) from Illinois, Kansas, and Tennessee have led to the belief that these animals vary in their mating strategies and the degree to which they are monogamous. Despite this, few studies have directly compared behavior between populations. Because the prairie vole is commonly discussed as a model for mammalian monogamy, understanding how aspects of social attachment and the mating system vary could provide further insight into the evolution of monogamy. We therefore conducted a series of experiments in the laboratory and field to assess morphological, behavioral, or genetic differences between 2 populations of this species. Voles from Illinois were morphologically similar to voles from Tennessee and exhibited comparable social and mating behavior under both laboratory and field conditions. Although genetically distinct, the 2 populations demonstrated similar levels of heterozygosity and allelic richness. Sexual dimorphism, a common indicator of mating strategy, was absent in voles from 7 widely distributed regions from across their geographic range. In the context of these results, we question the degree to which the previously described population differences are ecologically meaningful. If differences between prairie voles from Kansas and Illinois do indeed exist, examination of our data suggests that those from Kansas are atypical of prairie voles overall.

AB  - Human factors (attitudes, personality traits, self-esteem, job satisfaction) strongly determine our behaviour towards animals, animal production and animal welfare. Recent studies have emphasised positive human contacts as indicators of a stockperson's positive attitude towards animals and towards animal welfare in general. Stockmanship can be improved by careful selection of people and/or by training. However, little is known of the biological basis of the effect of stock handling procedures on the welfare of animals. The animal's perception of the stock-person (based both on emotional responses and cognitive aspects such as anticipation, recognition and categorisation), and the existence of sensitive periods in an animal's life, need to be explored in more depth, especially under farm conditions. We need to consider the complexity of human behaviour (eg husbandry practices, balance between positive and negative interactions, predictability, controllability) and the effect on animal welfare from the animal's point of view, throughout its whole life. This paper identifies the importance of positive human contacts for both animals and stockpeople, and highlights the challenge to maintain such positive contacts despite the trend in modern agriculture to increase the number of animals per stockperson. This requires better knowledge of animal genetics, socialisation to humans during sensitive periods, and management of the social group. We emphasise the ethical importance of the human-animal relationship in the context of farm animal welfare and productivity.

AB  - Variability of the haptoral hard parts of four Black Sea Gyrodactylus species (G. alviga Dmitrieva Gerasev, 2000; G. crenilabri Zaika, 1966; G. flesi Malmberg, 1957; G. sphinx Dmitrieva & Gerasev, 2000) was studied in relation to season, host and geographical variability. A discriminant analysis was carried out on the measurements of 14 characters of the haptor of all four species. The haptoral hard parts of the investigated gyrodactylids decrease in size with an increase in water temperature. It is known that life-span of gyrodactylids is negatively correlated with water temperature and they exhibit peak intensities at low temperature. At the same time, life-span is considered to be a general indicator of a favourable environment. Therefore, high water temperature is not apparently advantageous for gyrodactylids. In the case of low marine salinity, in adapted species the sizes of the haptoral hard parts are larger at lower levels of salinity and vice versa for typical marine species. Lastly, in specimens parasitising the primary host, these features are larger than in those parasitising a secondary host. It is possible to say that, in general, the more favourable the environment for gyrodactylids the larger their haptoral hard parts. Unfavourable environmental conditions reduce the time of embryogenesis, which has a dual effect on gyrodactylids: positive in relation to their reproduction (by increasing the reproduction rate) and negative in relation to their development (by decreasing the size of the haptoral hard parts).

AB  - Concentrations of Fe, Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd were determined during one season in the red alga Gracilaria verrucosa, sediment and seawater from the Thermaikos Gulf, Greece. This region has been subject to change due to increases in industrial and domestic activities. The relative abundance of metals in G. verrucosa and seawater decreased in the order: Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cd and in the sediment: Pb > Fe > Zn > Cu > Cd. Cadmium concentration in the alga correlated positively with that in seawater. There was positive correlation between Fe concentrations in the alga and those of the Zn and Cu. The concentrations of metals in the alga showed no significant differences between the stations. Lead, Zn and Cu concentrations in the alga were slightly higher at Biamyl, whereas Cd was higher at Perea and Fe at Nea Krini. Seasonal variation of metal concentrations in the alga was significant for Cd and Fe. Copper and Fe increased from winter to summer, whereas Cd was the opposite. Zinc concentrations were minimum and Pb concentrations were maximum during spring. These variations are discussed in relation to tissue age, life cycle, ambient concentrations of metals and other environmental conditions. Cd and Pb concentrations in G. verrucosa in the Thermaikos Gulf were higher and those of Cu and Zn were lower than in other species of the genus.
